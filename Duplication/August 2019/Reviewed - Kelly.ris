N2  - BACKGROUND: In 2005, the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) developed a definition and grading system for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). The authors sought to determine the rate of POPF after enucleation and/or resection of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) and to identify clinical, surgical, or pathologic factors associated with POPF. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pancreatic enucleations and resections performed from March 1998 to April 2010. We defined a clinically significant POPF as a grade B that required nonoperative intervention and grade C. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients were identified; 62 patients had enucleations and 60 patients had resections of PNET. The rate of clinically significant POPF was 23.7 % (29/122). For pancreatic enucleation, the POPF rate was 27.4 % (17/62, 14 grade B, 3 grade C). The pancreatic resection group had a POPF rate of 20 % (12/60, 10 grade B, 2 grade C). This difference was not significant (p = 0.4). In univariate analyses, patients in the enucleation group with hereditary syndromes (p = 0.02) and non-insulinoma tumors (p = 0.02) had a higher POPF rate. Patients in the resection group with body mass index (BMI) > 25 (p < 0.01), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1; p < 0.01) and those who underwent simultaneous multiple procedures (p = 0.02) had a higher POPF rate. Multivariate analyses revealed that hereditary syndromes were able to predict POPF in the enucleation group, while having BMI > 25 and increasing lesion size were also associated with POPF in the group undergoing resection. CONCLUSIONS: We found a clinically significant POPF rate after surgery in PNET to be 23.7 % with no difference by the type of operation. Our POPF rate is comparable to that reported in the literature for pancreatic resection for other types of tumors. Certain inherited genetic diseases-von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and MEN-1-were associated with higher POPF rates.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most commonly occurring solid cancer of the adult kidney with the majority of RCC cases being detected accidentally. The most aggressive subtype is clear cell RCC (ccRCC). miRNAs, a family of small noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression have been identified as key biological modulators. The von Hippel-Lindau pathway is one of the signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of ccRCC. Another oncogenic mechanism involves the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and serves as a central regulator of cell metabolism, proliferation and survival. Several studies have described the involvement of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis and progression of ccRCC. These molecules can be considered as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, allowing response to therapy to be monitored.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by germ line mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL). Tumors observed in this disorder include retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. The VHL gene product, pVHL, is a component of a ubiquitin ligase which targets the transcription factor known as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for degradation in the presence of oxygen. pVHL also plays roles in the control of extracellular matrix formation and cell-cycle exit. Different VHL mutations confer different site-specific risks of cancer. Type 2C VHL mutations confer an increased risk of pheochromocytoma without the other stigmata of VHL disease. Here we report that the products of such type 2C VHL alleles retain the ability to down regulate HIF but are defective for promotion of fibronectin matrix assembly. Furthermore, pVHL L188V, a well studied type 2C mutant, retained the ability to suppress renal carcinoma growth in vivo. These studies strengthen the notion that HIF deregulation plays a causal role in hemangioblastoma and renal carcinoma, and raises the possibility that abnormal fibronectin matrix assembly contributes to pheochromocytoma pathogenesis in the setting of VHL disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), also called angiomatosis retinae, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It is frequently associated with other tumors in the central nervous system, kidneys, or adrenal glands. In order to investigate the relationship between genotype and corresponding phenotypes, we performed molecular genetic analysis in a Japanese patient with VHL type 2A. METHODS: After informed consent had been obtained, the three exons of the VHL gene were PCR-amplified and sequenced either directly or after subcloning. Clinical features were also examined. RESULTS: A novel in-frame duplication of the 21 base pairs at nucleotide 806 (the position of codon 198) of the VHL gene was found in our patient. The clinical phenotype of the patient included retinal hemangiomas associated with vitreous hemorrhage and traction retinal detachment, pheochromocytoma, and hemangioma-like lesions in the cerebellum which corresponded to those of VHL type 2A. Abnormal diffuse vascular leakage was observed in the apparently intact retina by fluorescein angiography. CONCLUSION: An insertion mutation of the VHL gene is a rare association with VHL type 2. This insertion mutation may interfere the binding between the VHL gene and elongins. Abnormal retinal vascular leakage suggests the possible effects of overexpressed vascular permeability factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor from hemangiomas associated with defective VHL gene.

N2  - Somatic mosaicism is well known in disorders where the manifestations are readily seen, e.g. the skin in neurofibromatosis I. In single gene disorders of higher frequency, especially X-linked ones, the frequency of combined germ-line and somatic mosaicism is increasingly being appreciated, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Cell separation techniques; such as the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) also detect much somatic mosaicism among blood cells in disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Depending on the disorder and the class of mutation, in genes for which there are sufficient numbers of patients studied, 6-20% of cases are due to somatic mutation. This update of my previous review is stimulated by the rapid application of new technologies for the study of DNA variation in disease. The results of these studies implicate somatic mutation in a greater variety of genetic diseases and a wider spectrum of tissues than have previously been shown, including heart and kidney. The classes of mutation have also expanded beyond base pair changes, insertions/deletion (indels), and short tandem repeat mutations to include copy number variants and transposon-mediated mutations. I also briefly discuss previously well-known mosaicism for chromosomal mutations. Genomic sequencing, performed on DNA from blood, shows many mutations which are conclusively somatic in origin. It is still too early to see if there is a different pattern of somatic mutation compared to germ-line mutation. Though the parameters to allow careful quantification are not yet available, it seems that the frequency of gene mutation in embryonic cells is not markedly different than that in the germ line. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - By using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we characterized the genetic profiles of 36 VHL-related pheochromocytomas. We then compared the results with those of sporadic and MEN 2-related pheochromocytomas. In 36 VHL-related tumors, loss of chromosome 3 and chromosome 11 were found in 34 tumors (94%) and 31 tumors (86%), respectively. There was significant concordance of deletions in chromosomes 3 and 11 (Kappa = 0.64, P = 0.0095), suggesting that they are involved in two different but necessary and complementary genetic pathways. The loss of chromosome 11 appeared to be specific for VHL-related pheochromocytoma as it was not present in any of the 10 VHL-related CNS hemangioblastomas studied and was significantly less common when compared with (a) sporadic pheochromocytomas from previously published results (13%; P = <0.0001), and (b) MEN 2-related pheochromocytomas from this and previously published studies (30%; P = 0.0012). In summary, this is the first report of a novel consistent genetic alteration that is selected and specific for VHL-related pheochromocytoma, besides the two hits of the VHL gene.

N2  - Mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is responsible for familial and sporadic renal cell carcinomas as well as for cancers in many other organs. According to recent studies, the VHL protein (pVHL) is a multifunctional tumor suppressor protein associated with the inhibition of angiogenesis, cell cycle exit, fibronectin matrix assembly, and proteolysis. To examine whether pVHL affects other important cellular events such as morphogenesis, adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, or motility, we introduced the VHL gene into human kidney and lung cancer cells and compared its effects with those in parental cells. Compared with non-pVHL-expressing cells, the morphogenesis of pVHL-expressing cells was remarkably changed, with cells having many focal adhesions and stress fibers and a spreading morphology. The attachment ability of non-pVHL-expressing cells was significantly increased by expression of pVHL. Additional studies showed that vinculin was translocalized from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane by the pVHL expression, indicating induction of focal adhesion formation by pVHL. Furthermore, motility of the pVHL-expressing cells was significantly reduced compared with that of non-pVHL-expressing cells (P < 0.05). These results indicate that pVHL stabilized actin organization and inhibited cell motility through focal adhesion formation. Thus, pVHL plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and motility and functions as a unique suppressor protein in malignant cells.

N2  - To elucidate the role of somatic alterations for renal cancer etiology and prognosis, we analyzed 227 sporadic renal epithelial tumors for mutations and hypermethylations in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene VHL. Tumors were classified according to the recommendations of the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). Somatic VHL mutations were identified by PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and sequencing, and hypermethylations were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blotting. Frequencies of VHL alterations were established, and an association with tumor type or tumor type and tumor stage was evaluated. VHL mutations and hypermethylations were identified in 45% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCCs) and occasionally (3 of 28) in papillary (chromophilic) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Lack of VHL mutations and hypermethylations in chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas was statistically significant (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0004, respectively). RCCs carrying VHL alterations showed, in nine cases (12%), mutations at a hot spot involving a thymine repeat (ATT.TTT) in exon 2. Tumor staging was critical to the VHL mutation/hypermethylation detection rate in CCRCCs shown by separate evaluation of patients from medical centers in Munich, Heidelberg, and Mainz. The spectrum of pT1, pT2, and pT3 CCRCCs and the VHL mutation/hypermethylation detection rate varied among these three groups. Altogether, VHL alterations were significantly associated with pT3 CCRCCs (P = 0.009). This is the first evidence of frequent somatic VHL mutations at a particular site within exon 2 and an association of VHL mutations/hypermethylations with a standard prognostic factor.

N2  - Recent efforts have been aimed at targeting the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxia-induced gene pathway for renal cell carcinomas (RCC) therapy. Among the various genes induced by HIF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the critical mediators in angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. To date, however, limited information is available on the functional differences regarding VEGF transcription between the HIF subunits, namely HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. To investigate the HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha-dependent effect on VEGF gene induction in RCC, a panel of human RCC cell lines was analyzed. We found that a loss of HIF-1alpha protein expression was a common event in RCC cell lines, which was associated not only with truncated HIF-1alpha mRNA transcripts but also with transcriptional silencing. Since the CpG rich promoter region of the HIF-1alpha gene contained a similar frequency of methylated CpG dinucleotides in RCC cell lines, a complex and non-uniform mechanism may be involved in this phenomenon. In these HIF-1alpha defective cell lines, the knockdown of the HIF-2alpha gene demonstrated that HIF-2alpha regulated the VEGF production, irrespective of the VHL gene mutation status. In contrast, HIF-1alpha played a predominant role in VEGF secretion in the cells expressing both wild-type HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins. HIF-1alpha may therefore represent an important target molecule for RCC therapy; however, HIF-2alpha should be targeted in HIF-1alpha defective renal cancer cells.

N2  - Kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), is a disease of increasing incidence that commonly is seen in the general practice of nephrology. Despite this state of affairs, this fascinating and highly morbid disease frequently is under-represented, or even absent, from the curriculum of nephrologists in training and generally is underemphasized in national nephrology meetings, both scientific as well as clinical. Although classic concepts in cancer research in general had led to the concept that cancer is a disease resulting from mutations in the control of growth-regulating pathways, reinforced by the discovery of oncogenes, more contemporary research, particularly in kidney cancer, has uncovered changes in metabolic pathways mediated by those same genes that control tumor energetics and biosynthesis. This adaptation of classic biochemical pathways to the tumor's advantage has been labeled metabolic reprogramming. For example, in the case of kidney cancer there exists a near-universal presence of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) inactivation in the most common form, clear cell RCC (ccRCC), leading to activation of hypoxia-relevant and other metabolic pathways. Studies of this and other pathways in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) have been particularly revealing, leading to the concept that ccRCC can itself be considered a metabolic disease. For this reason, the relatively new method of metabolomics has become a useful technique in the study of ccRCC to tease out those pathways that have been reprogrammed by the tumor to its maximum survival advantage. Furthermore, identification of the nodes of such pathways can lead to novel areas for drug intervention in a disease for which such targets are seriously lacking. Further research and dissemination of these concepts, likely using omics techniques, will lead to clinical trials of therapeutics specifically targeted to tumor metabolism, rather than those generally toxic to all proliferating cells. Such novel agents are highly likely to be more effective than existing drugs and to have far fewer adverse effects. This review provides a general overview of the technique of metabolomics and then discusses how it and other omics techniques have been used to further our understanding of the basic biology of kidney cancer as well as to identify new therapeutic approaches.

N2  - The Elongin complex was originally identified as a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II and is composed of a transcriptionally active subunit (A) and two regulatory subunits (B and C). The Elongin BC complex enhances the transcriptional activity of Elongin A. "Classical" SOCS box-containing proteins interact with the Elongin BC complex and have ubiquitin ligase activity. They also interact with the scaffold protein Cullin (Cul) and the RING domain protein Rbx and thereby are members of the Cullin RING ligase (CRL) superfamily. The Elongin BC complex acts as an adaptor connecting Cul and SOCS box proteins. Recently, it was demonstrated that classical SOCS box proteins can be further divided into two groups, Cul2- and Cul5-type proteins. The classical SOCS box-containing protein pVHL is now classified as a Cul2-type protein. The Elongin BC complex containing CRL family is now considered two distinct protein assemblies, which play an important role in regulating a variety of cellular processes such as tumorigenesis, signal transduction, cell motility, and differentiation. © 2012 Okumura, Matsuzaki, Nakatsukasa and Kamura.

N2  - The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis mediates growth, differentiation and developmental processes, and is also involved in control of metabolic activities. Deregulation of IGF axis expression and action is linked to a number of pathologies, ranging from metabolic disorders to growth deficits and cancer development. Activation of the IGF signaling pathway is a crucial prerequisite for malignant transformation. In addition, overexpression of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) constitutes a typical hallmark of most types of cancer. A series of tumor suppressors have been identified whose mechanisms of action involve transcriptional suppression of the IGF-1R gene. These tumor suppressors include the p53/p63/p73 family, breast cancer gene-1, von-Hippel Lindau protein, Wilms tumor-1 and others. Comprehensive analyses have identified a complex bidirectional interplay between the IGF and tumor-suppressor signaling pathways. These interactions are of major importance in terms of cancer development and may also predict responsiveness to IGF-1R-targeted therapies. Furthermore, the insulin/IGF system has a pivotal role in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism. Deregulation of IGF axis components by mutated tumor-suppressor proteins may lead to metabolic perturbations, with ensuing pathological consequences. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) encompasses a heterogeneous group of histological subtypes, of which clear cell RCC (CCRCC) is the most common, comprising more than 70% of all cases. Papillary RCC (PRCC) is the next most common, comprising 10-15% of cases. PRCC is refractory to chemotherapy, immunotherapy and hormonal therapy. Recent improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology of CCRCC have identified multiple pathways associated with the development of this cancer. This has led to drug development targeting these pathways, including the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib, the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab and the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus. These drugs have shown significant clinical benefits in randomized trials of advanced CCRCC and have become the standard of care for most patients. However, since these trials were, on the whole, restricted to patients with clear cell histology, their efficacy in patients with non-clear cell RCC, and particularly PRCC, is unclear. This review will focus on the activity of these targeted agents in the treatment of metastatic PRCC. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.

N1  - 25th Annual Meeting of the Latin American Pediatric Endocrinology Society, SLEP 2015. Chile
N2  - Introduction: von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is an inherited syndrome caused by mutations of the vhl gene. It predisposes to the development of retinal and CNS hemangiomas, renal or pancreatic cysts/tumors, endolymphatic sac tumors and pheochromocytomas (pheo). Aim: To characterize the clinical presentation of patients with the VHL disease according to age. Patients and Methods: We evaluated 190 individuals belonging to 33 families by genetic screening of vhl gene. We described the clinical presentation and the outcome of 67 patients. They were divided into 2 groups according to age: group 1, <21 y (n = 36:5/36VHL1 and 31/36VHL2) and group 2, aged >=21 y (n = 31:8/31VHL1, 23/31VHL2). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Complete genetic analysis of vhl gene was performed using PCR and automatic sequencing for the study of point mutations and small deletions. MLPA and UPQFM-PCR was performed for study of gross deletions. Results: The VHL genetic analysis of 33 families showed: 24 missense mutations, 6 nonsense mutations, 1 small deletion, 1 gross deletion and 1 small insertion. The initial manifestation of VHL in group 1 was pheo in 28/36 patients (78%). During follow-up 17/28 pheo patients remained free of disease (median 11 y, range: 0-36) while the others presented hemangioblastoma of CNS (5), pheo (5) and neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor (1). Three patients died. Retinal hemangioblastoma (2), endolimphatic sac tumor (1) and CNS hemangioblastoma (5) were the initial presentation in the remaining 8 patients in this group. In one case, pheo appeared after 16 y of disease onset and other patient was free of disease during 21 y when retinal angioma and pancreas neuroendocrine tumor appeared. In group 2 the most common initial manifestation was CNS hemangioblastoma, observed in 14/31 patients (45%), followed by pheo in 12/31 patients (39%). The other clinical initial events were: retinal hemangioma (2), clear cell renal carcinoma (1), neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas (1) and pancreatic cysts (1). 17/31 patients remained free of disease (median: 4 y, 0-30 y) but the time of follow up was shorter than the group 1. Three patients died due to VHL in this group. During follow up the remaining 11 patiens presented hemangioblastoma of CNS (4), renal carcinoma (3), retinal hemangioma (2), neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas (1) and pheo (1). Conclusions: Our results confirmed that pheo is the predominant inicial event in VHL in the pediatric group while in the other group CNS hemangioblastoma and pheo appeared in similar frecuency. Comorbid pathology can appear after a long disease-free period, lifelong surveillance is mandatory in both groups.

N2  - UNLABELLED: (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) scintigraphy plays an important role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). (123)I-MIBG targets cell membrane and vesicular catecholamine transporters of chromaffin cells and facilitates localization of the primary tumor and metastatic lesions. Its specificity for the diagnosis of adrenomedullary chromaffin cell tumors can be jeopardized by physiologic uptake by the normal adrenal medulla. The aim of this study was to distinguish between PPGLs and normal adrenal glands by evaluating semiquantitative (123)I-MIBG uptake and to examine genotype-specific differences in correlation with expression of catecholamine transporter systems. METHODS: Sixty-two PPGLs collected from 57 patients with hereditary mutations in SDHA (n = 1), SDHB (n = 2), and SDHD (n = 4) (SDH is succinate dehydrogenase); von Hippel-Lindau (VHL; n = 2); RET (n = 12); neurofibromin 1 (NF1; n = 2); and MYC-associated factor X (MAX; n = 1), and with sporadic PPGLs (n = 33) were investigated. Preoperative planar and SPECT images were semiquantitatively analyzed using uptake measurements. Tumor-to-liver and normal adrenal-to-liver ratios were calculated and correlated with clinical characteristics including genotype, tumor size, and plasma metanephrines concentrations. The expression of norepinephrine transporter (NET) and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT-1) was evaluated immunohistochemically in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. RESULTS: Mean tumor-to-liver ratios of PPGL lesions were significantly higher than normal adrenal-to-liver ratios (P < 0.001). Cutoff values to distinguish between physiologic and pathologic adrenal uptake were established at 0.7 (100% sensitivity, 10.3% specificity) and 4.3 (100% specificity, 66.1% sensitivity). No statistically significant differences in (123)I-MIBG uptake were found across PPGLs of different genotypes. Mean NET expression in hereditary cluster 2 (RET, NF1, MAX) and apparently sporadic tumors was significantly higher than for hereditary cluster 1 (SDHx, VHL) PPGLs (P = 0.011 and 0.006, respectively). Mean VMAT-1 expression in hereditary cluster 1 PPGLs was significantly higher than for cluster 2 tumors (P = 0.010). (123)I-MIBG uptake significantly correlated with maximum tumor diameter (P = 0.002). (123)I-MIBG uptake, however, did not correlate with either NET or VMAT-1 expression. CONCLUSION: Liver-normalized semiquantitative (123)I-MIBG uptake may be helpful to distinguish between pheochromocytoma and physiologic adrenal uptake. Genotype-specific differences in the expression of NET and VMAT-1 do not translate into differences in (123)I-MIBG uptake.

N2  - A 21-year-old woman with a family history of von Hippel-Lindau disease presented with a mass in the head of the pancreas. Light microscopic features of the tumour suggested neuroendocrine differentiation and although it displayed positive immunostaining for the antigens expected in a neuroendocrine neoplasm, S-100 staining was also present. This unusual feature prompted further evaluation by routine and post-embedding protein-A gold immunoelectron microscopy, which demonstrated the presence of neuroendocrine granules. Tumour cell DNA content was normal by flow cytometry. Although this patient exhibited no other signs of von Hippel-Lindau disease, the presence of a pancreatic tumour with neuroendocrine differentiation demonstrated that she was affected. Future surveillance and genetic counselling will be influenced by this diagnosis.

N2  - The local anesthetic lidocaine induces cell death by altering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial electron transport chain function. Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is involved in determining oxygen metabolism and mitochondria function, we investigated the involvement of HIF-1 activity in lidocaine-induced cell death. We investigated the role of HIF activation on lidocaine-induced caspase activation and cell death in renal cell-derived RCC4 cells lacking functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. We demonstrate that HIF-1 suppressed oxygen consumption and facilitated glycolysis in a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1-dependent manner and that activation of HIF-1 conferred resistance to lidocaine-induced cell death. We also demonstrated that exogenous HIF-1 activation, through HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibition or exposure to hypoxic conditions, alleviates lidocaine toxicity by suppressing mitochondria function and generating ROS, not only in RCC4 cells, but also in the neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HIF-1 activation due to VHL deletion, treatment with small molecule HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors, and exposure to hypoxic conditions suppresses mitochondrial respiratory chain function and confers resistance to lidocaine toxicity.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a rare, autosomal, dominantly transmitted disease that genetically predisposes affected people to tumor development. The most common manifestations of the disease and those associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality are cerebellar, spinal, and medullary hemangioblastomas, retinal angiomas, renal cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. In this paper the genetic transmission, tumorigenesis, diagnosis, treatment, surveillance methods, and nursing implications associated with VHL are reviewed. The importance of early detection and the need for long-term follow-up are emphasized. Oncology nurses will need to stay abreast of the genetic aspects of cancer as information in this area increases and as expanded roles bring them in closer contact with patients and families affected by these conditions.

N2  - The multidisciplinary management of patients with paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas remains challenging. The cornerstone of excellent multidisciplinary management of such patients is genetic classification and management in a tertiary care referral center. Up to one third of all symptomatic presentations of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma are due to germline mutations in one of six genes defining multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and the paraganglioma syndromes types 1, 3, and 4. This genetic classification forms the basis early diagnosis and follow-up including management of relatives. Easily available clinical information such as tumor location and number, age, gender, and family history must be used to prioritize which gene should be tested. Mutation carriers should undergo regular check-up to detect and treat metachronous paraganglial and extraparaganglial tumors, and depending on syndrome, other extraparaganglial neoplasias such as medullary thyroid cancer and renal clear cell carcinomas in time. Adrenal and extraadrenal retroperitoneal tumors should be operated by surgeons highly experienced in minimal invasive, endoscopic techniques.

N2  - Systemic analysis of somatic mutations of other susceptibility genes in syndromic tumors as well as apparently sporadic tumors in well-characterized specimens is lacking. Its clinical relevance has not been studied. Our objective was to determine the frequency of second allele inactivation in syndromic tumors and determine the frequency and potential clinical impact of somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the known susceptibility genes in syndromic and sporadic tumors. Nine tumor specimens from clinically characterized VHL mutation, five from SDHB mutation, four from SDHD mutation, two from RET mutation carriers, and eight from apparently sporadic cases were analyzed. Tumor DNA mutation screening of the SDHx, VHL, and RET genes and LOH analyses of the SDHx and VHL genes were performed. The Yates-corrected chi-squared test was used for comparison of the clinical data and the molecular-genetic results. Second allele inactivation in tumors was identified in 83 % of VHL, 80 % of SDHB, and 50 % of SDHD specimen. High prevalence of VHL (6/6, p = 0.024) and SDHB (7/7, p = 0.018) somatic mutations has been identified in the sporadic group compared to all others. In the group of the VHL tumors the SDHB somatic events were significantly lower (2/6; p = 0.045). In 18/19 (95 %) of cases, we were able to demonstrate the presence of at least two concomitant affected susceptibility genes. We conclude that LOH is the most prevalent second allele-inactivating event. SDHB and VHL somatic mutation might play a role in the sporadic forms of tumor development. There is no clinical impact of mutation screening or LOH analysis of tumor specimens. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Background: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene. Patients have significant morbidity and mortality secondary to vascular tumors. Disease management is centered on tumor surveillance that allows early detection and treatment. Presymptomatic genetic testing is therefore recommended, including in at-risk children.Methods: We tested 17 families (n = 109 individuals) for VHL mutations including 43 children under the age of 18. Personalized genetic counseling was provided pre and post-test and the individuals undergoing presymptomatic testing filled out questionnaires gathering socio-demographic, psychological and psychiatric data. Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing of the VHL gene. Mutation-carriers were screened for VHL disease-related tumors and were offered follow-up annual examinations.Results: Mutations were identified in 36 patients, 17 of whom were asymptomatic. In the initial screening, we identified at least one tumor in five of 17 previously asymptomatic individuals. At the end of five years, only 38.9% of the mutation-carriers continued participating in our tumor surveillance program. During this time, 14 mutation carriers developed a total of 32 new tumors, three of whom died of complications. Gender, education, income, marital status and religiosity were not found to be associated with adherence to the surveillance protocol. Follow-up adherence was also independent of pre-test depression, severity of disease, or number of affected family members. The only statistically significant predictor of adherence was being symptomatic at the time of testing (OR = 5; 95% CI 1.2 - 20.3; p = 0.02). Pre-test anxiety was more commonly observed in patients that discontinued follow-up (64.7% vs. 35.3%; p = 0.01).Conclusions: The high initial uptake rate of genetic testing for VHL disease, including in minors, allowed the discontinuation of unnecessary screening procedures in non mutation-carriers. However, mutation-carriers showed poor adherence to long-term tumor surveillance. Therefore, many of them did not obtain the full benefit of early detection and treatment, which is central to the reduction of morbidity and mortality in VHL disease. Studies designed to improve adherence to vigilance protocols will be necessary to improve treatment and quality of life in patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. © 2010 Rasmussen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by loss of a functional Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. We investigated the potential of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VHL as biomarkers in metastatic ccRCC (m-ccRCC) patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 3 VHL SNPs in 199 m-ccRCC patients: rs1642742 T > C, rs1642743 A > G, and rs1678607 C > A. Primary end points were response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) after start of first-line TKI. RR was compared with Fisher's exact test, and PFS and OS with Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression. Secondary end points were association with VHL promotor hypermethylation, VHL mutation status, VHL loss of heterozygosity, >= 25% sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, and expression of genes implicated in angiogenesis and immunoresponse (Fisher's exact test and unpaired t tests).RESULTS: The minor alleles of rs1642742 and rs1642743, known to be in close linkage disequilibrium, were associated with poor outcome, following a recessive pattern. For the rs1642742 CC versus TT/TC genotype, OS was 11 versus 26 months (hazard ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.6; P = .015). For the rs1642743 GG versus AA/AG genotype, OS was 15 versus 28 months (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.0; P = .004). After multivariable analysis, both remained linked with poor OS (P = .018 and P = .009, respectively). There was a trend toward shorter PFS and poorer RR. Both SNPs were associated with >= 25% sarcomatoid dedifferentiation (P = .037 and .006, respectively). No significant results were found for rs1678607.CONCLUSION: rs1642742 and rs1642743 are candidate biomarkers for poor OS in m-ccRCC patients receiving first-line VEGFR-TKI. They are associated with higher levels of sarcomatoid dedifferentiation.

N2  - We examined ten patients from three families with von Hippel-Lindau disease and 26 of their at-risk relatives for the presence of twin vessels, defined as a paired retinal arteriole and venule that are separated by less than the diameter of one venule and extend for a distance of more than one disk diameter. They were compared with 36 age- and sex-matched controls. Of the 36 subjects in the study group, 23 had twin vessels compared with two controls (P less than 10(-6). Of the ten patients, nine (14 eyes) had twin vessels; no twin vessels were found in their controls (P = 5.9 x 10(-5)). Fourteen at-risk relatives and two of their controls had twin vessels (P = 9.4 x 10(-4)).

N2  - Tumors utilize hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway to cope with deleterious environmental conditions. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been shown to increase protein expression of the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1, a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis. Elevated levels of HIF-1alpha induce expression of genes with critical roles in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism, processes that are essential for tumor expansion. Here we examine the involvement of FOXO4 (also known as AFX), a member of the forkhead transcription factor superfamily that is negatively regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway, in the regulation of HIF-1alpha protein expression. Nuclear expression of FOXO4 results in the suppression of various responses to hypoxia, including decreased vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 1, and erythropoietin expression. Interestingly, FOXO4 down-regulates the HIF-1alpha protein levels, consistent with the lack of hypoxia responsiveness. Previous results have revealed a role for prolyl hydroxylation and resultant von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) interactions in the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1alpha. However, neither inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases nor mutation of HIF-1alpha-hydroxylated prolines involved with pVHL-mediated binding inhibits the observed FOXO4-mediated down-regulation of HIF-1alpha. These results suggest a novel alternate mechanism for hypoxic regulation that is dependent upon the level of activation of FOXO4-mediated transcription.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor pVHL is an E3 ligase that targets hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Mutation of VHL results in HIF up-regulation and contributes to processes related to tumor progression such as invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. However, very little is known with regard to post-transcriptional regulation of pVHL. Here we show that WD repeat and SOCS box-containing protein 1 (WSB1) is a negative regulator of pVHL through WSB1's E3 ligase activity. Mechanistically, WSB1 promotes pVHL ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby stabilizing HIF under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. As a consequence, WSB1 up-regulates the expression of HIF-1alpha's target genes and promotes cancer invasion and metastasis through its effect on pVHL. Consistent with this, WSB1 protein level negatively correlates with pVHL level and metastasis-free survival in clinical samples. This work reveals a new mechanism of pVHL's regulation by which cancer acquires invasiveness and metastatic tendency.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an inherited multisystem neoplastic disorder. We prepared a 2.5-megabase (Mb) restriction map of the region surrounding the VHL gene and identified and characterized overlapping deletions in three unrelated patients affected with VHL. The smallest nested deletion (100 kb) was located within a 510-kb NruI fragment detected by 19-63'. The rearrangements detected will be useful in isolating and evaluating candidate cDNAs for the VHL gene. The detailed physical map will be useful in studying the organization and structure of genes in the VHL region.

N2  - Our knowledge regarding the inherited factors that lead to the development of lesions within the pancreas is clearly incomplete. This article addresses clinical issues in patients at moderate-to-high risk for pancreatic malignancy, with special emphasis on the recognition and diagnosis of known genetic syndromes. Using the current available information, the authors attempt to equip the practicing surgeon with critical information to increase clinical suspicion for heritable syndromes and inform specific surgical management. Additionally, this article is meant to encourage the practicing surgeon to participate in the genetic testing/screening, cancer surveillance, and prevention activities of patients who have heritable cancer syndromes and associated pancreatic lesions that require surgery.

N2  - Object: Hemorrhages caused by hemangioblastomas are very rare and mostly located in the subarachnoid space. Intraparenchymal bleedings due to hemangioblastomas are even less frequent, and these hemorrhages are almost exclusively located in the supratentorial brain, cerebellum and spinal cord. We report the first case of a brainstem hemorrhage due to a hemangioblastoma of the medulla oblongata. Case Report: A 47-year-old woman presented with acute onset of headache, anarthria, inability to swallow, left-sided hemiparesis and hemidysesthesia with varying states of vigilance, finally developing acute respiratory failure. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a small hemangioblastoma of the posterior medulla oblongata causing intraparenchymal hemorrhage and acute occlusive hydrocephalus due to intraventricular hematoma extension. Result: After implantation of an external ventricular catheter to treat acute hydrocephalus, the hemangioblastoma as well as its associated hemorrhage could be removed in toto via a microsurgical posterior median suboccipital approach with minimal foramen magnum enlargement. During the follow-up period of six months postoperatively the patient showed good recovery with only slight residual neurological deficits. Conclusion: The most common causes of brainstem hemorrhages are arterial hypertension and cavernous hemangiomas. However, hemangioblastomas should not be ignored as a possible differential diagnosis for intraparenchymal brainstem hemorrhage. While the prognosis in hypertensive brainstem bleedings is mostly disastrous and surgery rarely indicated, an operative therapy should be considered in cases of hemorrhages caused by underlying tumors. Especially in the treatment of hemangioblastoma, the surgical management strategy is crucial for a successful result. Therefore, the authors recommend including the search for hemangioblastomas into the diagnostic workup in patients with brainstem hemorrhages. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

N2  - Oxygen-dependent ubiquitination of the alpha-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-alpha) by the (von Hippel-Lindau protein)-Elongin B/C-Cullin2-Rbx1 (VBC-Cul2) ubiquitin ligase, a member of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), plays a central role in controlling oxygen metabolism. Nedd8 conjugation of cullins enhances the ligase activity of CRLs, and the COP9/signalosome (CSN) enhances the degradation of several CRL substrates, although it removes Nedd8 from cullins. Here we demonstrate that CSN increased the efficiency of the VBC-Cul2 complex for recognizing and ubiquitinating substrates by facilitating the dissociation of ubiquitinated substrates from the pVHL subunit of the complex. Moreover CSN enhanced HIF-1alpha degradation by promoting the dissociation of HIF-1alpha from pVHL in cells. The length of the polyubiquitin chain conjugated to the substrate appeared to be involved in CSN-mediated dissociation of the substrate from pVHL. In contrast to other mechanisms underlying CSN-mediated activation of CRLs, the dissociation of ubiquitinated substrates from pVHL did not require the deneddylation activity of CSN, implying that CSN enhances degradation of CRL substrates by multiple mechanisms.

N2  - Angiogenesis has been targeted in retinopathies, psoriasis, and a variety of cancers (colon, breast, lung, and kidney). Among these tumour types, clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are the most vascularized tumours due to mutations of the von Hippel Lindau gene resulting in HIF-1 alpha stabilisation and overexpression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Surgical nephrectomy remains the most efficient curative treatment for patients with noninvasive disease, while VEGF targeting has resulted in varying degrees of success for treating metastatic disease. VEGF pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing generating pro-angiogenic isoforms. However, the recent identification of novel splice variants of VEGF with anti-angiogenic properties has provided some insight for the lack of current treatment efficacy. Here we discuss an explanation for the relapse to anti-angiogenesis treatment as being due to either an initial or acquired resistance to the therapy. We also discuss targeting angiogenesis via SR (serine/arginine-rich) proteins implicated in VEGF splicing.

N2  - Somatic mutations or loss of von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) happen in the majority of VHL disease tumors, which present a constitutively active Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), essential for tumor growth. Recently described mechanisms for pVHL modulation shed light on the open question of the HIF/pVHL pathway regulation. The aim of the present study was to determine the molecular mechanism by which RSUME stabilizes HIFs, by studying RSUME effect on pVHL function and to determine the role of RSUME on pVHL-related tumor progression. We determined that RSUME sumoylates and physically interacts with pVHL and negatively regulates the assembly of the complex between pVHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV), inhibiting HIF-1 and 2alpha ubiquitination and degradation. We found that RSUME is expressed in human VHL tumors (renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCC), pheochromocytoma and hemangioblastoma) and by overexpressing or silencing RSUME in a pVHL-HIF-oxygen-dependent degradation stability reporter assay, we determined that RSUME is necessary for the loss of function of type 2 pVHL mutants. The functional RSUME/pVHL interaction in VHL-related tumor progression was further confirmed using a xenograft assay in nude mice. RCC clones, in which RSUME was knocked down and express either pVHL wt or type 2 mutation, have an impaired tumor growth, as well as HIF-2alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor A and tumor vascularization diminution. This work shows a novel mechanism for VHL tumor progression and presents a new mechanism and factor for targeting tumor-related pathologies with pVHL/HIF altered function.

N2  - Capillary hemangioblastoma is the most frequent manifestation of the autosomal dominantly inherited von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease but also presents as a nonfamilial, sporadic vascular tumor. Hemangioblastomas are characterized by a dense network of capillaries in association with cysts. To investigate the mechanisms underlying neovascularization and cyst formation, we analyzed eight VHL disease-associated and five sporadic hemangioblastomas. Histologically, both tumor types showed a similar phenotype. The capillaries expressed the endothelial cell markers von Willebrand factor and CD31 antigen. We investigated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell-specific mitogen which is also known to induce vascular permeability in vivo, and its high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors flt-1 and KDR. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis revealed significant up-regulation of VEGF and VEGF receptor expression in VHL disease-associated and sporadic hemangioblastomas compared to normal brain and tumor stromal cells as sites of abundant VEGF transcription. Endothelial cells did not express detectable amounts of VEGF mRNA but coexpressed flt-1 and KDR. By immunohistochemistry, VEGF protein was detectable in the tumor interstitium and was found to be concentrated around capillaries. Performing reverse transcription-PCR, we demonstrated that VEGF121 and VEGF165 were the splice variants predominantly expressed, whereas mRNA encoding VEGF189 was present at smaller amounts. Our findings suggest that, in VHL disease-associated and sporadic hemangioblastomas, VEGF121 and VEGF165 are secreted by stromal cells and interact with the corresponding VEGF receptors expressed on tumor endothelial cells. This paracrine mechanism may mediate neovascularization and cyst formation in capillary hemangioblastomas.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Germline mutations are present in 20-30 per cent of patients with phaeochromocytoma. For patients who develop bilateral disease, complete removal of both adrenal glands (total adrenalectomy) will result in lifelong adrenal insufficiency with an increased risk of death from adrenal crisis. Unilateral/bilateral adrenal-sparing surgery (subtotal adrenalectomy) offers preservation of cortical function and independence from steroids, but leaves the adrenal medulla in situ and thus at risk of developing new and possibly malignant disease. Here, present knowledge about how tumour genotype relates to clinical behaviour is reviewed, and application of this knowledge when choosing the extent of adrenalectomy is discussed.METHODS: A literature review was undertaken of the penetrance of the different genotypes in phaeochromocytomas, the frequency of bilateral disease and malignancy, and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, with emphasis on explaining the clinical phenotypes of phaeochromocytomas and their associated syndromes.RESULTS: Patients with bilateral phaeochromocytomas most often have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) with high-penetrance mutations for benign disease, whereas patients with mutations in the genes encoding SDHB (succinate dehydrogenase subunit B) or MAX (myelocytomatosis viral proto-oncogene homologue-associated factor X) are at increased risk of malignancy.CONCLUSION: Adrenal-sparing surgery should be the standard approach for patients who have already been diagnosed with MEN2 or VHL when operating on the first side, whereas complete removal of the affected adrenal gland(s) is generally recommended for patients with SDHB or MAX germline mutations. Routine assessment of a patient's genotype, even after the first operation, can be crucial for adopting an appropriate strategy for follow-up and future surgery.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (vhl) gene, as well as allelic loss at the gene region (3p25-26) have been described in sporadic cases of the tumour types participating in VHL disease, but also in cancers not associated with the syndrome. In this study, we attempted mutation analysis of the vhl gene, as well as detection of allelic loss at 3p25-26 in sporadic human breast cancer. METHODS: Eighty-two tumour specimens were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the vhl region, and compared to the adjacent, histologically normal tissue. Furthermore, mutations within the three exons of vhl in the same panel of tumours were detected using SSCP and heteroduplex analysis and direct sequencing. RESULTS: To our knowledge this is the first mutational analysis reported for the vhl gene in breast cancer, however we failed to reveal any mutations in the specimens examined. All the cases were informative for at least one of the microsatellite markers tested, 24 (29.2%) exhibited LOH at 3p25-26. Clinical and pathological data were available for all tumours examined, however no significant correlations were encountered. CONCLUSION: These results strongly indicate against a critical involvement of the tumour suppressor vhl in breast carcinogenesis.

N2  - Background: To evaluate the significance of angioma number (single or multiple) for the presence of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease in patients presenting with capillary retinal angioma. Methods: Forty-one nonrelated patients presenting with capillary retinal angioma were evaluated. An ophthalmic workup, screening for other organ lesions, and molecular genetic screening for a mutation of the VHL gene was performed. The diagnosis of VHL was made on the basis of the personal and family history, the presence of other VHL-associated organ lesions, or the presence of a mutation of the VHL gene. Results: Thirteen patients (32%) presented with a single angioma and 28 patients (68%) presented with multiple angiomas. In 81% of all patients, VHL could be diagnosed. Diagnosis of VHL could be readily made by the personal or family history in 51% of all patients. In another 27% of all patients, VHL disease was evidenced by screening for other VHL-associated lesions. In two patients (3%) VHL could be diagnosed by molecular genetics only. All patients with multiple retinal angiomas had VHL disease and, in 38% of patients with a single angioma, VHL was present. Reasons for a missing family history in patients with VHL disease were the presence of a de novo mutation (15% of VHL patients) or clinical anticipation of VHL disease (18% of VHL patients). Conclusion: The presence of multiple retinal angiomas strongly suggests VHL disease, which, however, can be obscured by presence of a de novo mutation or by clinical anticipation of VHL disease in affected families. A single retinal angioma may be sporadic as well as the presenting sign of VHL. Diagnosis and screening for this multitumor syndrome is substantially supported by molecular genetics.

N2  - The heterodimeric transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor), consisting of a labile alpha-subunit and a stable beta-subunit, is a master regulator of genes involved in acute or chronic adaptation to low oxygen. Studies performed over the past 5 years revealed that HIFalpha-subunits are enzymatically hydroxylated in an oxygen-dependent manner. Hydroxylation of either of two conserved prolyl residues targets HIFalpha for destruction by a ubiquitin ligase containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein whereas hydroxylation on a C-terminal asparagine affects HIF transactivation function. Pharmacological manipulation of HIF activity might be beneficial in diseases characterized by abnormal tissue oxygenation including myocardical infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The physiologic response to changes in cellular oxygen tension is ultimately governed by a heterodimeric transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which, in adaptation to compromised oxygen availability, transactivates a myriad of genes, including those responsible for de novo vascularization, production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, and anaerobic metabolism. Accumulation of HIF is observed in most types of solid tumors and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and disease progression, underscoring the importance and relevance of HIF in cancer. The protein stability and, thereby, the activity of HIF are principally regulated by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (ECV) that targets the catalytic subunit HIFalpha for oxygen-dependent ubiquitin-mediated destruction. Individuals who inherit germline VHL mutation develop VHL disease, which is characterized by the development of hypervascular tumors in multiple yet specific organs. This review will examine recent progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the function of ECV and the significance of consequential regulation of HIF in oncogenesis.

N2  - The diagnostic confusion in differentiating the various causes of renal cystic diseases in adults is well documented. This confusion can include misclassifications between autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). We describe such a case of VHL. A review of the literature and of the patients in our database regarding typical features of each disease, mean age of onset, and frequency of these features was undertaken to provide helpful differentiating features. Pancreatic cysts are one differentiating feature. In VHL, pancreatic cysts can occur in 70% of patients, often are multiple, and rarely may cause exocrine or endocrine insufficiency. Pancreatic islet cell tumors occur. In ADPKD, pancreatic cysts are found in only 9% of patients, usually are single and asymptomatic, generally occur in conjunction with cystic liver disease, and are not found in children or unaffected family members. Pancreatic malignancies do not occur with increased frequency in ADPKD. A different pattern, especially in patients without a strong family history of ADPKD, may be a clue to VHL masquerading as ADPKD. Genetic mutation screening of the VHL gene should be used in these patients. © 2001 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical features, visual outcomes, and therapeutic complications of patients with retinal capillary hemangiomas. METHODS: A retrospective, non-comparative, observational case study of patients diagnosed with retinal capillary hemangiomas was conducted. Twelve patients (13 eyes) at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital of Kaohsiung from July 1987 to June 2001 were reviewed. Pre- and post-treatment visual acuity and ocular complications are described. RESULTS: One patient had bilateral and another had unilateral juxtapapillary hemangiomas. All of the other 10 patients were diagnosed with peripheral retinal capillary hemangiomas. More patients had retinal capillary hemangiomas located in the temporal peripheral retina and all had endophytic growth patterns. No patient met the diagnostic criteria of von Hippel-Lindau disease. Visual acuity levels of peripheral retinal hemangiomas without exudative retinal detachment often remained the same after focal laser treatment. Two patients received vitreoretinal surgery. Patients with juxtapapillary hemangiomas had variable visual outcomes and visual field defects during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of capillary hemangiomas in the retinal periphery and treatment by focal laser produced good visual outcomes. If untreated, the tumors may eventually be complicated with exudative retinal detachment and have a worse visual prognosis even with vitreoretinal surgery.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the type of VHL gene pathogenic variant influences the growth rate or CT enhancement values of renal lesions in VHL patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two VHL patients (19 male) were selected from a prospectively maintained imaging database for patients that underwent surgical tumor resection between 2014 and 2016. One hundred and eleven VHL lesions were marked for resection and pathology analysis. Whole lesion volumetric segmentation was performed on nephrographic phase of the two most recent contrast-enhanced CT scans before surgery. Intensity distribution curves were obtained from segmentations. A linear mixed model, accounting for within-patient correlations, was used to compare the growth and enhancement differences between different germline pathogenic variant types.RESULTS: There was no significant difference for the lesions' total growth between different germline pathogenic variants (P value = 0.78). The median growth rate for all lesions was 1.7 cc/year (IQR 0.5, 3.9) with a baseline median size of 4.1 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 1.7, 11.7). In complex lesions, the solid portion of the tumor demonstrated a higher growth rate (1.6 cc/year) than cystic portions (0.02 cc/year) which stayed relatively unchanged. Only one pathogenic variant (Splice donor) showed some levels of difference in its relative enhancement from other subtypes.CONCLUSION: The type of germline pathogenic variant on the VHL gene does not affect the growth rate or CT enhancement values of renal lesions in patients with VHL. The absolute growth rate of these tumors may be used in the scheduling of follow-up studies.

N2  - As the ultimate electron acceptor in oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen plays a critical role in metabolism. When oxygen levels drop, heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) transcription factors become active and facilitate adaptation to hypoxia. Hif regulation by oxygen requires the protein von Hippel-Lindau (pVhl) and pVhl disruption results in constitutive Hif activation. The liver is a critical organ for metabolic homeostasis, and Vhl inactivation in hepatocytes results in a Hif-dependent shortening in life span. While albumin-Cre;Vhl F/F mice develop hepatic steatosis and impaired fatty acid oxidation, the variable penetrance and unpredictable life expectancy has made the cause of death elusive. Using a system in which Vhl is acutely disrupted and a combination of ex vivo liver perfusion studies and in vivo oxygen measurements, we demonstrate that Vhl is essential for mitochondrial respiration in vivo. Adenovirus-Cre mediated acute Vhl disruption in the liver caused death within days. Deprived of pVhl, livers accumulated tryglicerides and circulating ketone and glucose levels dropped. The phenotype was reminiscent of inborn defects in fatty acid oxidation and of fasted PPARalpha-deficient mice and while death was unaffected by pharmacologic PPARalpha activation, it was delayed by glucose administration. Ex vivo liver perfusion analyses and acylcarnitine profiles showed mitochondrial impairment and a profound inhibition of liver ketone and glucose production. By contrast, other mitochondrial functions, such as ureagenesis, were unaffected. Oxygen consumption studies revealed a marked suppression of mitochondrial respiration, which, as determined by magnetic resonance oximetry in live mice, was accompanied by a corresponding increase in liver pO 2. Importantly, simultaneous inactivation of Hif-1B suppressed liver steatosis and rescued the mice from death. These data demonstrate that constitutive Hif activation in mice is sufficient to suppress mitochondrial respiration in vivo and that no other pathway exists in the liver that can allow oxygen utilization when Hif is active precluding thereby metabolic collapse. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau disease is a heritable multisystem cancer syndrome that is associated with a germline mutation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. This disorder is not rare (about one in 36 000 livebirths) and is inherited as a highly penetrant autosomal dominant trait (ie, with a high individual risk of disease). Affected individuals are at risk of developing various benign and malignant tumours of the central nervous system, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, and reproductive adnexal organs. Because of the complexities associated with management of the various types of tumours in this disease, treatment is multidisciplinary. We present an overview of the clinical aspects, management, and treatment options for von Hippel-Lindau disease.

N2  - There have been significant advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of renal carcinogenesis. In particular, research in the last five years has demonstrated a central role for the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene by mutation or hypermethylation in the formation of the conventional type of renal cell carcinoma. The von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is characterised by germ-line inactivating mutation whereas sporadic renal carcinoma is associated with somatic mutations. Tumour formation is accompanied by loss of the remaining wild-type allele. The biology of the von Hippel-Lindau gene and its normal function continued to be unravelled but a role has been demonstrated for it in the regulation of gene transcription, the regulation of oxygen-dependent genes and their expression and the control of tumour angiogenesis acting via the vascular endothelial growth factor. Another form of familial renal cancer, the hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma, has been shown to be consequent upon activating mutations of the c-met proto-oncogene. The genetic data continue to enhance our understanding of the biology of this common set of neoplasms. [References: 20]

N2  - Loss of the VHL tumor suppressor gene promotes cancer in several ways, including activation of the HIF transcription factors. HIF overexpression is associated with increased malignancy in many tumor types. So why is the spectrum of tumors associated with VHL loss restricted only to a few specific organs? In a recent paper in the March issue of Nature Cell Biology, Kaelin and colleagues provide a possible explanation, suggesting that VHL loss can also trigger senescence, a potent tumor suppressor mechanism. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Somatic mutations or reduced expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor occurs in the majority of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and is a causal factor for the pathogenesis of ccRCC. pVHL was reported to suppress the oncogenic activity of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) by reducing the expression of the EGFR agonist TGF-alpha and by reducing the translation efficiency of EGFR itself. Furthermore, it was reported that pVHL down-regulates activated EGFR by promoting efficient lysosomal degradation of the receptor. These modes of negative regulation of EGFR by pVHL were dependent on Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF). In this study, we report that HIF was not the only factor stabilizing the activated EGFR in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells. Down-regulation of endogenous HIF in these cells had little effect on the turnover rates of the activated EGFR. Furthermore, neither pretreatment with lysosomal inhibitors pretreatment nor down-regulation of c-Cbl, a major E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the activated EGFR for lysosomal degradation, significantly increased the stabilities of EGFR in VHL-expressing ccRCC cells. In contrast, pretreatment with proteasomal inhibitors extended EGFR lifetime and led to similar EGFR half-lives in VHL-expressing and VHL-deficient ccRCC cells. Down-regulation of c-Cbl in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells revealed that the c-Cbl and pVHL collaborated to down-regulate the activated EGFR. Finally, we found that pVHL promoted the poly-ubiquitylation of the activated EGFR, and this function was c-Cbl-independent. Thus these results indicate that pVHL limits EGFR signaling by promoting c-Cbl-independent poly-ubiquitylation of the activated receptor, which likely results in its degradation by proteasome.

N2  - pVHL, the product of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, functions as the substrate recognition component of an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that targets hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) for ubiquitination and degradation. Besides HIF-alpha, pVHL also interacts with other proteins and has multiple functions. Here, we report that pVHL inhibits ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. We find that pVHL associates with the 40S ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) but does not target it for destruction. Rather, the pVHL-RPS3 association interferes with the interaction between RPS3 and RPS2. Expression of pVHL also leads to nuclear retention of pre-40S ribosomal subunits, diminishing polysomes and 18S rRNA levels. We also demonstrate that pVHL suppresses both cap-dependent and cap-independent protein synthesis. Our findings unravel a novel function of pVHL and provide insight into the regulation of ribosome biogenesis by the tumor suppressor pVHL.

N2  - Tumours of the spinal cord, although rare, are associated with high morbidity. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for patients with this disease, and offers the best chance for cure. Such surgical procedures, however, carry substantial risks such as worsening of neurological deficit, paralysis and death. New therapeutic avenues for spinal cord tumours are needed, but genetic studies of the molecular mechanisms governing tumourigenesis in the spinal cord are limited by the scarcity of high-quality human tumour samples. Many spinal cord tumours have intracranial counterparts that have been extensively studied, but emerging data show that the tumours are genetically and biologically distinct. The differences between brain and spine tumours make extrapolation of data from one to the other difficult. In this Review, we describe the demographics, genetics and current treatment approaches for the most commonly encountered spinal cord tumours-namely, ependymomas, astrocytomas, haemangioblastomas and meningiomas. We highlight advances in understanding of the biological basis of these lesions, and explain how the latest progress in genetics and beyond are being translated to improve patient care. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - The Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology has developed a set of guidelines for pancreatobiliary cytology including indications for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, terminology and nomenclature of pancreatobiliary disease, ancillary testing, and post-biopsy management. All documents are based on the expertise of the authors, a review of the literature, discussions of the draft document at several national and international meetings, and synthesis of selected online comments of the draft document. This document presents the results of these discussions regarding the use of ancillary testing in the cytologic diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic lesions. Currently, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) appears to be the most clinically relevant ancillary technique for cytology of bile duct strictures. The addition of FISH analysis to routine cytologic evaluation appears to yield the highest sensitivity without loss in specificity. Loss of immunohistochemical staining for the protein product of the SMAD4 gene and positive staining for mesothelin support a diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical markers for endocrine and exocrine differentiation are sufficient for a diagnosis of endocrine and acinar tumors. Nuclear staining for beta-catenin supports a diagnosis of solid-pseudopapilary neoplasm. Cyst fluid analysis for amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen aids in the preoperative classification of pancreatic cysts. Many gene mutations (KRAS, GNAS, VHL, RNF43, and CTNNB1) may be of aid in the diagnosis of cystic neoplasms. Other ancillary techniques do not appear to improve diagnostic sensitivity sufficiently to justify their increased costs. Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Precision therapy for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) requires molecular biomarkers ascertaining disease prognosis. In this study, we performed integrated proteomic and transcriptomic screening in all four tumour-node-metastasis stages of ccRCC and adjacent normal tissues (n = 18) to investigate differentially expressed genes. Most identified differentially expressed genes revealed a strong association with transforming growth factor-beta level and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process. Of them, Serpin peptidase inhibitor clade H member 1 (SERPINH1) revealed the strongest association with poor prognosis and regulation on the expression levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Subsequently, two independent sets (n = 532 and 105) verified the high level of SERPINH1 in ccRCC tissues and its association with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in all tumour-node-metastasis stages and patients with von Hippel-Lindau wild-type (VHL-WT). SERPINH1 was an independent predictor of poor overall survival (hazard ratio 0.696 for all patients) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.433 for all patients and 0.362 for patients with VHL-WT) in ccRCC. We have thus shown for the first time that SERPINH1 is an independent precision predictor for unfavourable prognosis in ccRCC. This could assist in identifying patients who need early aggressive management and deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of VHL-WT ccRCC.

N2  - Capillary hemangioblastomas (CHB) of the central nervous system, the most common tumor in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, usually show mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p25-p26. Because little is known concerning the cytogenetic changes in these tumors, we studied 22 cases through comparative genomic hybridization to screen for DNA copy number changes in both sporadic and VHL-associated CHB. Our analysis revealed that 6 of 22 samples (27%) contained DNA copy number losses, whereas no gains were observed. The most recurrent finding was loss of chromosomal arm 6q, seen in five cases. In two of these cases also loss of chromosome 3 was noted. The third aberration observed was loss of chromosome 8, seen in one case. No differences were noted between VHL-associated and sporadic tumors, nor did the cytogenetic aberrations correlate with the clinical outcome. The loss of 6q, seen in this study and previously in other VHL-associated tumors (renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas) and other tumors, suggest that this chromosome area may contain tumor suppressor genes involved in the early steps of tumorigenesis.

The product of the VHL gene, pVHL, in association with elongins B and C, cullin 2, and Rbx1 form an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex VEC that targets the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for ubiquitination. Ubiquitin-tagged HIF-alpha proteins are subsequently degraded by the common 26S proteasome. pVHL functions as the substrate-docking interface that specifically recognizes prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-alpha. This hydroxylation occurs only in the presence of oxygen or normoxia. Thus, under hypoxia, HIF-alpha subunits are no longer subjected to degradation and are thereby able to dimerize with the common and constitutively stable beta subunits. The heterodimeric HIFs upregulate a myriad of hypoxia-inducible genes, triggering our physiologic response to hypoxia. Inappropriate accumulations of HIF-alpha in VHL disease are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis via the upregulation of several of these HIF target genes. Our current molecular understanding of the roles of HIF and pVHL in the development of VHL-associated clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) is the focus of this review.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome in which a genetic defect in the VHL gene is located on chromosome 3p25. The urologic surgeon is an integral part of the management team for patients who have VHL disease, because patients frequently have multiple urologic tumors. This article presents a cumulative review of the literature regarding the diagnosis and management of urologic tumors in patients who have VHL disease, along with the latest data regarding the genetics and molecular mechanisms of VHL disease.

N2  - The new WHO-classification of renal tumors includes new subtypes, one of which is the mucinous, tubular, and spindle cell carcinoma. Many of these tumors had been previously diagnosed as sarcomatoid carcinoma. There are areas of cord-like growth and spindle cell configuration, sometimes with a clear cell appearance. The cells have low-grade nuclear features. It has been postulated that these tumors are related to the loop of Henle. In this study, 21 tumors were immunohistochemically and genetically analyzed. The analysis showed complex genomic aberrations, but no chromosome 3p losses, Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected no von Hippel-Lindau gene deletions on chromosome 3p25, which are characteristic for clear cell renal carcinomas. These findings show that there is no genetic relationship to clear cell renal carcinomas. The results of the immunohistochemical analyses showed a complex immunophenotype, but could not prove a derivation from the loop of Henle. The prognosis of these tumors seems to be favorable.

N2  - The prevalence of secondary hypertension is lower than that of primary (essential) hypertension, but it is likely that it has been underestimated because appropriate tests were not generally performed. Hence, before embarking on a search for secondary hypertension physicians are generally advised to select populations of patients with a high pre-test probability of secondary forms of hypertension in order to maximize the positive predictive value and the gain in "ruling in" of the diagnostic tests. Based on updated information on prevalence and pathophysiology we herein critically review the general diagnostic strategy and the management of the main forms of secondary hypertension. In particular, strategies for identifying primary aldosteronism, the most frequent form of endocrine secondary hypertension, and for determining its unilateral or bilateral causes are discussed in details, because of the differences of treatment that requires adrenalectomy in the unilateral forms and mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in the bilateral forms. The tests available for the diagnosing pheochromocytoma, which is much rarer but extremely important to identify, as it can be fatal if unrecognized are also discussed, with emphasis on the recent developments in genetic testing. Renovascular hypertension is also a common curable form of hypertension, which should be identified as early as possible to avoid the onset of cardiovascular target organ damage and events, is also discussed. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Over the last several decades, the advances in molecular genetics have elucidated kidney cancer gene pathways. Kidney cancer is a heterogeneous disorder. Each specific type of kidney cancer has its own histologic features, gene, and clinical course. Insight into the genetic basis of kidney cancer has been learned largely from the study of the familial or hereditary forms of kidney cancer. Extirpative surgery is currently the treatment of choice for kidney cancer that is confined to the kidney. Treatment for advanced or metastatic kidney cancer is a formidable challenge with the traditional therapies currently available. However, investigation of the Mendelian single-gene syndromes, like von Hippel Lindau (VHL: VHL gene), hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC: c-Met gene), Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD: BHD gene), and hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell cancer (HLRCC: fumarate hydratase gene) provides an opportunity to develop pathway specific therapies. Advances in molecular therapeutics offer novel treatment options for patients with advanced disease. [References: 54]

N2  - We herein summarize the pathology and most recent advances in the molecular genetics of serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. They typically present as relatively large, well-demarcated tumors (mean size, 6. cm), predominantly occurring in females. Pre-operative diagnosis remains challenging; imaging findings and cyst fluid analysis often prove non-specific and fine-needle aspiration often does not yield diagnostic cells. Pathologically, they are characterized by a distinctive cytology referred to as "serous." Although they have ductal differentiation, they distinctly lack the mucin production that characterizes most other pancreatic ductal tumors, including ductal adenocarcinoma and its variants, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). They instead produce abundant glycogen (glycogen-rich adenoma). Serous cystadenomas also lack the molecular alterations that characterize ductal neoplasms, such as mutation of KRAS (high prevalence in most mucinous ductal neoplasms), inactivation of SMAD4 (seen in ductal adenocarcinomas), and mutations in GNAS (seen in some IPMNs) and RNF43 (detected in MCNs and IPMNs). Instead, new molecular and immunohistochemical observations place serous pancreatic tumors closer to "clear cell neoplasms" seen in various other organs that are associated with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) pathway, such as clear cell renal cell carcinomas and capillary hemangioblastomas. Patients with VHL syndrome have an increased risk of developing serous pancreatic tumors and somatic mutations of the VHL gene are common in these tumors along with modification of its downstream effectors including hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1), glucose uptake and transporter-1 (GLUT-1), a common factor in clear cell (glycogen-rich) tumors, as well as expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thought to be a factor in the striking capillarization of serous cystadenomas and other non-pancreatic clear cell tumors. VEGF may prove to be of significant diagnostic value since its elevation in cyst fluid has recently been found highly sensitive and specific for serous neoplasms. These molecular alterations establish serous tumors as prototypes of clear cell tumorigenesis and angiogenesis and may prove helpful both as diagnostic and non-surgical therapeutic targets.

N2  - Object. The tumors most frequently associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease are hemangioblastomas. While they are associated with significant neurological impairment and mortality, their natural history and optimal management have not been fully defined. Methods. Patients with VHL were enrolled in a prospective study designed to define the natural history of CNS hemangioblastomas. In the present analysis, serial imaging, laboratory, genetic, and clinical data were evaluated in those with at least 2 years of follow-up data. Results. At study entrance 225 patients (111 males, 114 females) harbored 1921 CNS hemangioblastomas in the supratentorial compartment (21 tumors [1%]), cerebellum (865 [45%]), brainstem (129 [7%]), spinal cord (689 [36%]), cauda equina (212 [11%]), and nerve roots (5 [0.3%]; follow-up 15,819 hemangioblastoma-years). Increased tumor burden was associated with partial deletions in the VHL gene (p = 0.005) and male sex (p = 0.002). Hemangioblastoma development (median 0.3 new tumors/year) was associated with younger age (p < 0.0001) and more tumors at study entrance (p < 0.0001). While 1278 hemangioblastomas (51%) did not grow, 1227 hemangioblastomas (49%) grew in a saltatory (886 [72%]), linear (76 [6%]), or exponential (264 [22%]) pattern. Faster tumor growth was associated with male sex (p = 0.001), symptomatic tumors (p < 0.0001), and tumors associated with cysts (p < 0.0001). Location-dependent tumor size was the primary predictor of eventual symptom formation (159 symptomatic tumors [6.3%]; area under the curve > 0.9). Conclusions. Central nervous system hemangioblastoma burden in VHL is associated with partial germline deletions and male sex. Unpredictable growth of hemangioblastomas compromises assessment of nonsurgical therapies. The judicious treatment of symptom-producing hemangioblastomas, while avoiding unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic tumors that may not progress, can provide clinical stability.

N2  - Renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma are common clinical manifestations of people with germ-line mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene, VHL. Recent cell biological evidence suggests that the VHL gene product, pVHL, functions to maintain the primary cilium, a microtubule-based antenna-like structure whose functional integrity is believed to have an important role in cell-cycle control. As VHL mutations are common in sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, but not papillary renal cell carcinoma, we asked whether there is an association between VHL status and primary cilia in vivo. VHL status was assessed in 20 cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and 9 cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma by DNA sequencing and by immunohistochemical staining for the hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha target gene products CA9 and GLUT-1. Of 20, 18 clear cell renal cell carcinomas, but only 1 of 9 papillary renal cell carcinomas, displayed evidence of VHL inactivation. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma the frequency of ciliated tumor cells ranged from 0 to 22% (median value 7.8+/-6.0%), whereas cilia frequency was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in papillary renal cell carcinoma (range 12-83%, median value 43.3+/-21.3%). There was no correlation between Ki-67 staining and cilia frequency, suggesting that the observed differences between the tumor types in cilia frequency are not accounted for by differences in cellular proliferation rates and that primary cilia degeneration in sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma depends on VHL inactivation. We propose that the different ciliation status of clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma may contribute, at least in part, to the different biological behaviors of these tumor types.

N2  - Late-stage clear cell renal carcinoma poses a formidable clinical challenge due to the high mortality rate associated with this disease. Molecular and genetic studies have identified functional loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene as a frequent and crucial event in the development of the malignant phenotype of clear cell renal carcinomas. Loss of VHL function thus represents a pathognomonic molecular defect for therapeutic exploitation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of targeting VHL loss through pharmacologic means. Chromomycin A3 (ChA3) was identified through in silico analysis of existing publicly available drug profiles from the National Cancer Institute as an agent that seemed to selectively target VHL-deficient clear cell renal carcinoma cells. Genotype-selective toxicity was first determined through short-term viability assays and then confirmed with clonogenic studies. Coculture of fluorescently labeled VHL-deficient and VHL-positive cells showed discriminate killing of the VHL-deficient cells with ChA3. Mechanistically, overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2alpha in VHL-positive clear cell renal carcinoma cells phenocopied loss of VHL with respect to ChA3 toxicity, establishing ChA3 as a HIF-dependent cytotoxin. This study shows the feasibility of selectively targeting the loss of the VHL tumor suppressor gene in clear cell renal carcinoma for potential clinical benefit and may have greater ramifications in the development of new targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and other genetic diseases. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes retinal hemangioblastomas, hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic cysts and tumors, pheochromocytomas, and epididymal cystadenomas, among other less common manifestations. Although this entity has been recognized for almost 70 years, recent developments in the genetics and imaging of VHL disease have greatly improved understanding of the disease and its natural history. This review describes the major events that led to the discovery of the gene for VHL and will familiarize the reader with recent developments in the magnetic resonance Imaging, computed tomographic, and ultrasound findings of this entity. Despite advances in the genetic understanding of this disease, imaging techniques will continue to play a major role in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of VHL. [References: 111]

N2  - A common genetic mutation found in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) is the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, which results in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), and contributes to cancer progression and metastasis. CUB-domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) was shown to promote metastasis in scirrhous and lung adenocarcinomas as well as in prostate cancer. In this study, we established a molecular mechanism linking VHL loss to induction of the CDCP1 gene through the HIF-1/2 pathway in renal cancer. Also, we report that Fyn, which forms a complex with CDCP1 and mediates its signaling to PKCdelta, is a HIF-1 target gene. Mechanistically, we found that CDCP1 specifically regulates phosphorylation of PKCdelta, but not of focal adhesion kinase or Crk-associated substrate. Signal transduction from CDCP1 to PKCdelta leads to its activation, increasing migration of CC-RCC. Furthermore, patient survival can be stratified by CDCP1 expression at the cell surface of the tumor. Taken together, our data indicates that CDCP1 protein might serve as a therapeutic target for CC-RCC.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein protects microtubules (MTs) from destabilization by nocodazole treatment. Based on this fixed-cell assay with static end points, VHL has been reported to directly stabilize the MT cytoskeleton. To investigate the dynamic changes in MTs induced by VHL in living cells, we measured the influence of VHL on tubulin turnover using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). To this end, we engineered VHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma cells to constitutively incorporate fluorescently labeled tubulin and to inducibly express VHL. Induction of VHL in these cells resulted in a decrease of tubulin turnover as measured by FRAP at the cell periphery, while minimally influencing MT dynamics around the centrosome. Our data indicates that VHL changes the behavior of MTs dependent on their subcellular localization implying a role for VHL in cellular processes such as migration, polarization, and cell-cell interactions. Here we propose a complementary method to directly measure VHL-induced subcellular changes in microtubule dynamics, which may serve as a tool to study the effect of MT binding proteins such as VHL.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases (HPHs) are responsible for hydroxylation of proline residues in hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha), resulting in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated proteasome degradation of the hydroxylated proteins. Pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme leads to stabilization of HIF-alpha proteins and consequent activation of HIF, which provides therapeutic benefit for a variety of tissues undergoing ischemic stress. In an effort to develop a new assay for measuring HPH activity, we designed a fusion protein, VHL beta-domain-luciferase. Recombinant fusion protein with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag was purified from Escherichia coli. GST-VHL beta-domain-luciferase with C-terminal deletion (GVbL-CD) was obtained as a major product and found to have luciferase activity. In a GVbL-CD capture assay using HIF peptide-bound beads, at least a 13-fold increase in luciferase activity was elicited for HIF peptide with hydroxyproline compared with unhydroxylated HIF peptide. HPH inhibitory activities of known HPH inhibitors or HIF-1alpha inducers were assessed using this assay, whose results were in good agreement with those obtained from conventional methods. The competitive effect of 2-ketoglutarate on dimethyloxalylglycine-mediated HPH inhibition was assessed very well in the new assay. Taken together, the VHL beta-domain protein with luciferase activity is of use for HPH activity assay.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcriptional complex that controls cellular and systemic homeostatic responses to oxygen availability. HIF-1 alpha is the oxygen-regulated subunit of HIF-1, an alpha beta heterodimeric complex. HIF-1 alpha is stable in hypoxia, but in the presence of oxygen it is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the ubiquitination complex pVHL, the protein of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene and a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Capture of HIF-1 alpha by pVHL is regulated by hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues in two functionally independent regions of HIF-1 alpha. The crystal structure of a hydroxylated HIF-1 alpha peptide bound to VCB (pVHL, elongins C and B) and solution binding assays reveal a single, conserved hydroxyproline-binding pocket in pVHL. Optimized hydrogen bonding to the buried hydroxyprolyl group confers precise discrimination between hydroxylated and unmodified prolyl residues. This mechanism provides a new focus for development of therapeutic agents to modulate cellular responses to hypoxia.

N2  - PURPOSE: Ecteinascidin 743 (Et743; trabectedin, Yondelis) has recently been approved in Europe for the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas and is undergoing clinical trials for other solid tumors. Et743 selectively targets cells proficient for TC-NER, which sets it apart from other DNA alkylating agents. In the present study, we examined the effects of Et743 on RNA Pol II. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: We report that Et743 induces the rapid and massive degradation of transcribing Pol II in various cancer cell lines and normal fibroblasts. Pol II degradation was abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and was dependent on TC-NER. Cockayne syndrome (CS) cells and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells (XPD, XPA, XPG, and XPF) were defective in Pol II degradation, whereas XPC cells whose defect is limited to global genome NER in nontranscribing regions were proficient for Pol II degradation. Complementation of the CSB and XPD cells restored Pol II degradation. We also show that cells defective for the VHL complex were defective in Pol II degradation and that complementation of those cells restores Pol II degradation. Moreover, VHL deficiency rendered cells resistant to Et743-induced cell death, a similar effect to that of TC-NER deficiency. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that both TC-NER-induced and VHL-mediated Pol II degradation play a role in cell killing by Et743.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumours in many organ systems, including renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. It is not completely understood what underlies the development of renal pathology, and the use of murine Vhl models has been challenging due to limitations in disease conservation. We previously described a zebrafish model bearing inactivating mutations in the orthologue of the human VHL gene.METHODS: We used histopathological and functional assays to investigate the pronephric and glomerular developmental defects in vhl mutant zebrafish, supported by human cell culture assays.RESULTS: Here, we report that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity in zebrafish embryos. vhl mutant glomeruli are enlarged, cxcr4a+ capillary loops are dilated and the Bowman space is widened. While we did not observe pronephric cysts, the cells of the proximal convoluted and anterior proximal straight tubule are enlarged, periodic acid schiff (PAS) and Oil Red O positive, and display a clear cytoplasm after hematoxylin and eosine staining. Ultrastructural analysis showed the vhl-/- tubule to accumulate large numbers of vesicles of variable size and electron density. Microinjection of the endocytic fluorescent marker AM1-43 in zebrafish embryos revealed an accumulation of endocytic vesicles in the vhl mutant pronephric tubule, which we can recapitulate in human cells lacking VHL.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity during zebrafish development, and suggests a role for VHL in endocytic vesicle trafficking.

N2  - pVHL, the product of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation of human kidney cells, and inactivation of the VHL gene is the most frequent genetic event in human kidney cancer. The biochemical function of pVHL is unknown. Here we report that pVHL exists in vivo in a complex that displays ubiquitination-promoting activity in conjunction with the universally required components E1, E2, and ubiquitin. pVHL-associated ubiquitination activity requires, at a minimum, pVHL to bind elongin C and Cul-2, relatives of core components of SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/Cul-1-F-box protein) E3 ligase complexes. Notably, certain tumor-derived mutants of pVHL demonstrate loss of associated ubiquitination promoting activity. These results identify pVHL as a component of a potential SCF-like E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and suggest a direct link between pVHL tumor suppressor and the process of ubiquitination.

N2  - RATIONALE: Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and its major product inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) regulate a variety of cellular functions, but their role in vascular biology remains unexplored.OBJECTIVE: We have investigated the role of IPMK in regulating angiogenesis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Deletion of IPMK in fibroblasts induces angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models. IPMK deletion elicits a substantial increase of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which mediates the regulation of angiogenesis by IPMK. The regulation of VEGF by IPMK requires its catalytic activity. IPMK is predominantly nuclear and regulates gene transcription. However, IPMK does not apparently serve as a transcription factor for VEGF. HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-1alpha is a major determinant of angiogenesis and induces VEGF transcription. IPMK deletion elicits a major enrichment of HIF-1alpha protein and thus VEGF. HIF-1alpha is constitutively ubiquitinated by pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein) followed by proteasomal degradation under normal conditions. However, HIF-1alpha is not recognized and ubiquitinated by pVHL in IPMK KO (knockout) cells. IP5 reinstates the interaction of HIF-1alpha and pVHL. HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation, which is prerequisite for pVHL recognition, is interrupted in IPMK-deleted cells. IP5 promotes HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha. Deletion of IPMK in mouse brain increases HIF-1alpha/VEGF levels and vascularization. The increased VEGF in IPMK KO disrupts blood-brain barrier and enhances brain blood vessel permeability.CONCLUSIONS: IPMK, via its product IP5, negatively regulates angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF expression. IP5 acts by enhancing HIF-1alpha hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha.

N2  - We report a 12-year laboratory experience in the diagnosis of 37 patients with phaeochromocytoma, one with malignant paraganglioma and one with ganglioneuroblastoma. Surgery was performed in eight different hospitals, which underlines the difficulty of ensuring uniformity of investigations. Of the 37 with phaeochromocytoma, 15 were in the right adrenal gland, 12 were on the left, seven were bilateral and three were extra adrenal. Twenty-three were male and 15 were female; the median age was 36 years. Four of five patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease had bilateral adrenal tumours and four had neurofibromatosis. None had multiple endocrine neoplasia. Using essential hypertensive patients as a reference population, diagnostic sensitivity was 80% for noradrenaline, 54.4% for adrenaline, 19.1% for dopamine, 93.3% for total normetanephrine, 33.3% for total metanephrine, 78.7% for 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelic acid (HMMA) and 23.5% for homovanillic acid (HVA). However, if each patient's results were taken as a package, the sensitivities were 100% for noradrenaline, 63.6% for adrenaline, 30.3% for dopamine and 89% for HMMA. Seven recent patients had gene analysis. There were six (15.4%) deaths due directly or indirectly to the paraganglioma. Postoperative blood pressures were normal in 74%. The decrement in catecholamine values post-surgery is shown. Urinary noradrenaline values fell by a mean of 94.5% and the use of urinary noradrenaline as a tumour marker is also demonstrated.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: There is a permanent increase of renal cancer morbidity rate. The most frequent histopathological form is a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Proven risk factors include von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. It predisposes body to form benign and malignant tumors in various organs. The VHL syndrome comes into existence due to germline mutations in VHL suppressor gene, which is located on 3p26-p25 and inherited in autosomally dominant way. The disease incidence is estimated at 1: 36 000 persons among live births. Depending on clinical view of VHL syndrome two types of the disease can be distinguished (I and II), and type II is divided into three subtypes, what is strictly related to mutation kind. 1000 mutations of VHL gene have been documented. According to reports in sporadic ccRCC VHL gene mutations occur with the frequency of 60-80%. Damage of the VHL protein is followed by accumulation of the transcription factor HIFalpha as well as super-expression of the coding genes VEGF, PDGF-beta, TGF-alpha and EPO, which is closely related to the process of angiogenesis. Material & Methods: Research includes patients hospitalized at the Department of Urology since December of 2009 until July of 2011, who underwent surgical treatment (nephrectomy or NSS) due to a kidney tumor. During qualification process for the project the following elements were taken into consideration: USG, CT of abdomen, lab analysis, questionnaire. Patients with metastases other than to the lungs or histopathological diagnosis other than ccRCC were disqualifed. Samples of blood and the tumor tissue were collected from patients. In the Laboratory of Human Molecular Genetics DNA was isolated from collected samples. Each of the three exons of VHL gene was amplifed in separate PCR reactions, electrophoresis was carried out. PCR products were sent for sequencing. Analysis of the mutations was done using Finch TV and CLC programs. Results: There were 100 patients with renal cell carcinoma qualified for the project including 42 women and 58 men. Medium age of the patients is 64 years. 67% of the patients had hypertension, 43% smoked cigarettes, and 80% had a BMI above normal. 53 people have mutations in the VHL gene, of which two persons had germline mutation. The highest number of mutations were in exon 1 (28 mutations), exon 2 had 16 mutations and in exon 3 had the lowest number of mutations - 9. The most frequent type of mutations was frameshift - it occurred in 36 patients. Point mutation occurred in 16 patients. One patient had both. Out of point mutations only 2 mutations were nonsense, 14 - missense, silent did not occur. In frameshift mutation 26 was a deletion type, 9 was an insertion and one of them had both. The study examined if there is a correlation between the presence of mutations and a gender, symptoms, risk factors, staging, grading and family history. Statistically significant was association between mutation and presence of hypertension and obesity. Conclusions: The analysis showed no correlation between the mutation and clinical parameters of ccRCC. These associations might be significant at the protein level which is in the future scope of the study.

N2  - BACKGROUND: PTEN loss contributes to the development of liver diseases including hepatic steatosis and both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). The factors that influence the penetrance of these conditions are unclear. We explored the influence of sustained hypoxia signaling through co-deletion of Pten and Vhl in a murine model. METHODS: We used a CreER-linked Keratin 18 mouse model to conditionally delete Pten, Vhl or both in somatic cells of adult mice, evaluating the resultant tumors by histology and gene expression microarray. Existing sets of gene expression data for human HCC and CC were examined for pathways related to those observed in the murine tumors, and a cohort of human CC samples was evaluated for relationships between HIF-1alpha expression and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Both Pten deletion genotypes developed liver tumors, but with differing phenotypes. Pten deletion alone led to large hepatic tumors with widespread hepatosteatosis. Co-deletion of Pten and Vhl with the Keratin 18 promoter resulted in reduced steatosis and a reduced tumor burden that was characterized by a trabecular architecture similar to CC. Genes associated with hepatic steatosis were coordinately expressed in the human HCC dataset, while genes involved in hypoxia response were upregulated in tumors from the human CC dataset. HIF-1alpha expression and overall survival were examined in an independent cohort of human CC tumors with no statistical differences uncovered. CONCLUSION: Pten deletion in Keratin 18 expressing cells leads to aggressive tumor formation and widespread steatosis in mouse livers. Co-deletion of Vhl and Pten results in lower tumor burden with gene expression profiling suggesting a switch from a profile of lipid deposition to an expression profile more consistent with upregulation of the hypoxia response pathway. A relationship between tumor hypoxia signaling and altered hepatic steatotic response suggests that competing influences may alter tumor phenotypes.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) regulates transcription in response to changes in O(2) concentration. O(2)-dependent degradation of the HIF-1alpha subunit is mediated by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)/Elongin-C/Elongin-B E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and the proteasome. Inhibition of heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) leads to O(2)/PHD/VHL-independent degradation of HIF-1alpha. We have identified the receptor of activated protein kinase C (RACK1) as a HIF-1alpha-interacting protein that promotes PHD/VHL-independent proteasomal degradation of HIF-1alpha. RACK1 competes with HSP90 for binding to the PAS-A domain of HIF-1alpha in vitro and in human cells. HIF-1alpha degradation induced by the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylaminogeldanamycin is abolished by RACK1 loss of function. RACK1 binds to Elongin-C and promotes ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha. Elongin-C-binding sites in RACK1 and VHL show significant sequence similarity. Thus, RACK1 is an essential component of an O(2)/PHD/VHL-independent mechanism for regulating HIF-1alpha stability through competition with HSP90 and recruitment of the Elongin-C/B ubiquitin ligase complex.

N2  - The human von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor is a marginally stable protein previously used as a model substrate of eukaryotic refolding and degradation pathways. When expressed in the absence of its cofactors, VHL cannot fold and is quickly degraded by the quality control machinery of the cell. We combined computational methods with in vivo experiments to examine the basis of the misfolding propensity of VHL. By expressing a set of randomly mutated VHL sequences in yeast, we discovered a more stable mutant form. Subsequent modeling suggested the mutation had caused a conformational change affecting cofactor and chaperone interaction, and this hypothesis was then confirmed by additional knockout and overexpression experiments targeting a yeast cofactor homolog. These findings offer a detailed structural basis for the modulation of quality control fate in a model misfolded protein and highlight burial mode modeling as a rapid means to detect functionally important conformational changes in marginally stable globular domains.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor, consisting of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit, that controls cellular responses to hypoxia. HIFalpha contains two transcriptional activation domains called the N-terminal transactivation domain (NTAD) and the C-terminal transactivation domain (CTAD). HIFalpha is destabilized by prolyl hydroxylation catalyzed by EglN family members. In addition, CTAD function is inhibited by asparagine hydroxylation catalyzed by FIH1. Both hydroxylation reactions are linked to oxygen availability. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) is frequently mutated in kidney cancer and is part of the ubiquitin ligase complex that targets prolyl hydroxylated HIFalpha for destruction. Recent studies suggest that HIF2alpha plays an especially important role in promoting tumor formation by pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells among the three HIFalpha paralogs. Here we dissected the relative contribution of the two HIF2alpha transactivaiion domains to hypoxic gene activation and renal carcinogenesis and investigated the regulation of the HIF2alpha CTAD by FIH1. We found that the HIF2alpha NTAD is capable of activating both artificial and naturally occurring HIF-responsive promoters in the absence of the CTAD. Moreover, we found that the HIF2alpha CTAD, in contrast to the HIF1alpha CTAD, is relatively resistant to the inhibitory effects of FIH1 under normoxic conditions and that, perhaps as a result, both the NTAD and CTAD cooperate to promote renal carcinogenesis in vivo.

N2  - Introduction. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a pathological condition that causes various clinical symptoms and is difficult to diagnose. The most common pathological lesions are hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, retinal angiomas, renal clear cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. Case Report. A 23-year-old female had a syncope episode in 2008. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right temporal hemangioblastoma, which was treated surgically. Genetic screening identified a VHL gene mutation, and computed tomography (CT) revealed a left adrenal mass. Since it was unclear whether the mass was a pheochromocytoma, or another benign or malignant tumors, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed. A month after surgery, the patient complained of general fatigue, poor concentration, loss of appetite, and insomnia. After careful clinical investigation, the patient was referred to a psychiatrist due to suspected depression, which was confirmed. Conclusions. VHL genetic screening should be performed in cases of hemangioblastoma. In VHL syndrome cases, pheochromocytoma cannot always be diagnosed by biochemical catecholamine analyses; therefore, CT or MRI scanning of the abdomen must be performed. Due to the long treatment period, some patients may develop episodes of depression, which can simulate VHL syndrome.

N2  - Genetic studies of neuroendocrine tumors were mainly performed on the basis of major syndromes predisposing to endocrine and associated proliferative lesions. Carcinoid tumors and tumors of the pancreatic islet cells occur in Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Tuberous Sclerosis, suggesting that alterations of the major genes responsible for these genetic syndromes are crucial mechanisms in the neuroendocrine pathogenesis. Tumoral progression and metastasis result from secondary genetic events or deregulation involving specific genes, oncogenes, suppressor genes, and growth factors. Mechanisms involving mitosis, cell cycle, and cellular adhesion might be relevant in the metastatic process. This report is an overview of experimental data on this topic and attempt to understand the major events inducing a malignant evolution of the normal neuroendocrine tissue.

N2  - Protein degradation is one of the tactics employed by the cell for irreversibly inactivating proteins. In eukaryotes, ATP-dependent protein degradation in the cytoplasm and nucleus is carried out by the 26S proteasome. Most proteins are targeted to the 26S proteasome by covalent attachment of a multi-ubiquitin chain. A key component of the enzyme cascade that results in attachment of the multi-ubiquitin chain to the target or labile protein is the ubiquitin ligase that controls the specificity of the ubiquitination reaction. Defects in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis have been shown to result in a variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the role of ubiquitin-dependent degradation in human disease and potential clinical applications that are being developed to exploit the cells natural proteolytic machinery to treat diseases.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau disease is caused by inactivating germline mutations of the VHL tumour suppressor gene and is associated with an increased risk of a variety of tumours in an allele-specific manner. The role of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in the pathogenesis of VHL-defective tumours has been more firmly established during the past 5 years. In addition, there is now a greater appreciation of HIF-independent VHL functions that are relevant to tumour development, including maintenance of the primary cilium, regulation of extracellular matrix formation and turnover, and modulation of cell death in certain cell types following growth factor withdrawal or in response to other forms of stress. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas, intra-adrenal paraganglioma, and extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors derived from adrenal chromaffin cells or similar cells in extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia, respectively. Serious morbidity and mortality rates associated with these tumors are related to the potent effects of catecholamines on various organs, especially those of the cardiovascular system. Before any surgical procedure is done, preoperative blockade is necessary to protect the patient against significant release of catecholamines due to anesthesia and surgical manipulation of the tumor. Treatment options vary with the extent of the disease, with laparoscopic surgery being the preferred treatment for removal of primary tumors. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a malignancy of the thyroid C cells or parafollicular cells. Thyroid C cells elaborate a number of peptides and hormones, such as calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and chromogranin A. Some or all of these markers are elevated in patients with MTC and can be used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to follow patients longitudinally for recurrence. Medullary thyroid cancer consists of a spectrum of diseases that ranges from extremely indolent tumors that are stable for many years to aggressive types associated with a high mortality rate. Genetic testing for RET mutations has allowed identification of familial cases and prophylactic thyroidectomy for cure. The only curative treatment is complete surgical resection.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is mutated in at least 50% of sporadic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This leads to a pseudohypoxic state in which the pVHL complex does not degrade hypoxia-inducible factor. Subsequent intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor accumulation results in increased production of growth factors such as VEGF, responsible for angiogenesis, tumor proliferation and mitogenesis. Recently, a number of strategies have been designed to specifically target these pathways, The VEGF, its related receptor, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway, in particular, have been utilized as therapeutic targets. Clinical trials have demonstrated the survival benefit of these agents, particularly in clear-cell RCC. Today, sunitinib is recommended as first-line therapy for intermediate- or low-risk patients with metastatic RCC. Sorafenib is advised as second-line therapy, whereas temsirolimus is generally recommended as first-line treatment in high-risk patients. Everolimus is the new standard following sunitinib. High-risk parients appeared to benefit less than low-risk parients from bevacizumab plus IFN-alpha therapy. High-dose IL-2 has been proven effective in prolonging progression-free survival or overall survival, depending on risk group selection criteria. Although novel agents show a consistent effect as measured by objective response, no currently available data demonstrate that these agents will cure any patient. © 2009 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - More than 2% of adults harbor a pancreatic cyst, a subset of which progresses to invasive lesions with lethal consequences. To assess the genomic landscapes of neoplastic cysts of the pancreas, we determined the exomic sequences of DNA from the neoplastic epithelium of eight surgically resected cysts of each of the major neoplastic cyst types: serous cystadenomas (SCAs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs). SPNs are low-grade malignancies, and IPMNs and MCNs, but not SCAs, have the capacity to progress to cancer.We found that SCAs, IPMNs, MCNs, and SPNs contained 10 +/- 4.6, 27 +/- 12, 16 +/- 7.6, and 2.9 +/- 2.1 somatic mutations per tumor, respectively. Among the mutations identified, E3 ubiquitin ligase components were of particular note. Four of the eight SCAs contained mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL), a key component of the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex that has previously been associated with renal cell carcinomas, SCAs, and other neoplasms. Six of the eight IPMNs and three of the eight MCNs harbored mutations of RNF43, a gene coding for a proteinwith intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that has not previously been found to be genetically altered in any human cancer. The preponderance of inactivating mutations in RNF43 unequivocally establish it as a suppressor of both IPMNs and MCNs. SPNs contained remarkably fewgenetic alterations but always contained mutations of CTNNB1, previously demonstrated to inhibit degradation of the encoded protein (beta-catenin) by E3 ubiquitin ligases. These results highlight the essential role of ubiquitin ligases in these neoplasms and have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cystic tumors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A high frequency of genetic alterations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and overexpression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene have been observed independently in human sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCCs), but to the authors' knowledge the association between the two has not been characterized in primary sporadic RCC. In the current study the authors report the simultaneous comparison of the biallelic inactivation status of the VHL gene and VEGF expression levels in patients with sporadic RCC. METHODS: DNA and RNA were extracted from 27 sporadic RCC samples. Mutation was analyzed by direct sequencing of the amplified VHL DNA and cDNA. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the gene was analyzed at three polymorphic markers. The VEGF mRNA was measured using Northern blot analysis. RESULTS: Mutations of the VHL gene were found in 14 of 27 RCC samples (51.9%). LOH analysis by a VHL-intragenic polymorphic marker and 2 extragenic microsatellite markers, D3S1560 and D3S1317, showed that LOH occurred in 10 of 15 RCC samples (66.7%). Overexpression of VEGF mRNA was observed in 17 of 27 RCC cases (63.0%): 15 of the 18 RCC samples estimated to have at least 1 hit, but only 2 of the 6 RCC samples with 0-1 hit, and none of the 3 RCC samples in which the VHL gene was not inactivated. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF overexpression was found to be correlated with both monoallelic and biallelic VHL inactivation. Alteration of the VHL gene is believed to cause angiogenesis in RCC cases through the overexpression of VEGF.

N2  - Context: Kidney cancer is among the 10 most frequently occurring cancers in Western communities. Globally, about 270 000 cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed yearly and 116 000 people die from the disease. Approximately 90% of all kidney cancers are renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Objective: The causes of RCC are not completely known. We have reviewed known aetiologic factors. Evidence acquisition: The data provided in the current review are based on a thorough review of available original and review articles on RCC epidemiology with a systemic literature search using Medline. Evidence synthesis: Smoking, overweight and obesity, and germline mutations in specific genes are established risk factors for RCC. Hypertension and advanced kidney disease, which makes dialysis necessary, also increase RCC risk. Specific dietary habits and occupational exposure to specific carcinogens are suspected risk factors, but results in the literature are inconclusive. Alcohol consumption seems to have a protective effect for reasons yet unknown. Hardly any information is available for some factors that may have a high a priori role in the causation of RCC, such as salt consumption. Conclusions: Large collaborative studies with uniform data collection seem to be necessary to elucidate a complete list of established risk factors of RCC. This is necessary to make successful prevention possible for a disease that is diagnosed frequently in a stage where curative treatment is not possible anymore. © 2010 European Association of Urology.

N2  - Despite well-established protocols for the medical management of Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), families affected by this rare tumour syndrome continue to face numerous psychological, social, and practical challenges. To our knowledge, this is one of the first qualitative studies to explore the psychosocial difficulties experienced by families affected by VHL. A semi-structured interview was developed to explore patients' and carers' experiences of VHL along several life domains, including: self-identity and self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, education and career opportunities, family communication, physical health and emotional well-being, and supportive care needs. Quantitative measures were also used to examine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and disease-specific distress in this sample. Participants were recruited via the Hereditary Cancer Clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, Australia. A total of 23 individual telephone interviews were conducted (15 patients, 8 carers), yielding a response rate of 75%. A diverse range of experiences were reported, including: sustained uncertainty about future tumour development, frustration regarding the need for lifelong medical screening, strained family relationships, difficulties communicating with others about VHL, perceived social isolation and limited career opportunities, financial and care-giving burdens, complex decisions in relation to childbearing, and difficulties accessing expert medical and psychosocial care. Participants also provided examples of psychological growth and resilience, and voiced support for continued efforts to improve supportive care services. More sophisticated systems for connecting VHL patients and their families with holistic, empathic, and person-centred medical and psychosocial care are urgently needed.

N2  - Background: Von Hippel-Lindau Disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant inherited systemic cancer syndrome that gives rise to cystic and highly vascularized tumors in many organs, including the eye. Recent studies have contributed to the understanding of VHL pathophysiology, genetics, and the role of the VHL protein. This article reviews recent studies on VHL clinical findings, genetics and tumorigenesis. Methods: Literature review of articles on VHL genetics with correlation to clinical findings. Results: Genotype-phenotype correlation studies show that patients with a complete deletion mutation of the VHL gene, relative to participants with a missense or protein-truncating mutation, had better visual acuity and decreased tumorigenesis incidence of retinal hemangioblastomas. It has also been documented that higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia induced factor (HIF), and ubiquitin are found in ocular hemangioblastomas. The stromal foamy vacuolated cells seem to be the true tumor cells of the disease acting on the surrounding endothelial cells in ocular hemangioblastomas. Tumor cells and ocular lesions have shown increased levels of Erythropoietin (Epo), Epo receptor (EpoR), and CD133. Also, CXCR4, a CXC chemokine receptor, is expressed in retinal VHL hemangioblastomas. Recent studies suggest that the VHL mutation alone may not be sufficient to develop VHL-associated neoplasms. Studies suggest that targeting various proteins along with anti-angiogenesis molecules may be a better therapeutic approach than targeting VEGF alone. Conclusion: Understanding of the mechanisms and genetics underlying VHL and its associated retinal hemangioblastomas has increased substantially in recent years. This knowledge suggests that future advances may include better identification of individuals at higher risk of vision loss and the development of novel individualized therapies. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Tumors utilize hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway to cope with deleterious environmental conditions. Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been shown to increase protein expression of the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1, a key regulator of oxygen homeostasis. Elevated levels of HIF-1alpha induce expression of genes with critical roles in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism, processes that are essential for tumor expansion. Here we examine the involvement of FOXO4 (also known as AFX), a member of the forkhead transcription factor superfamily that is negatively regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway, in the regulation of HIF-1alpha protein expression. Nuclear expression of FOXO4 results in the suppression of various responses to hypoxia, including decreased vascular endothelial growth factor, glucose transporter 1, and erythropoietin expression. Interestingly, FOXO4 down-regulates the HIF-1alpha protein levels, consistent with the lack of hypoxia responsiveness. Previous results have revealed a role for prolyl hydroxylation and resultant von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) interactions in the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1alpha. However, neither inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases nor mutation of HIF-1alpha-hydroxylated prolines involved with pVHL-mediated binding inhibits the observed FOXO4-mediated down-regulation of HIF-1alpha. These results suggest a novel alternate mechanism for hypoxic regulation that is dependent upon the level of activation of FOXO4-mediated transcription.

N2  - Three cases with torticollis caused by an infratentorial tumour are presented. A father and his son both had a Lindau tumour, and another patient had an ependymoma. It is stressed that torticollis may be the predominant or only sign of an infratentorial tumour, and that torticollis should always be suspected to have an organic origin.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To determine the origin of the neoplastic cell in central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas in von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and its role in tumor formation and distribution, we characterized and differentiated neoplastic cells from hemangioblastomas removed from VHL patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 31 CNS hemangioblastomas from 25 VHL patients were resected and analyzed. Tumor cells from the hemangioblastomas were characterized, grown, and differentiated into multiple lineages. Resected hemangioblastomas were located in the cerebellum (11 tumors), brainstem (five tumors), and spinal cord (15 tumors). Consistent with an embryologically derived hemangioblast, the neoplastic cells demonstrated coexpression of the mesodermal markers brachyury, Flk-1 (vascular endothelial growth factor-2), and stem cell leukemia (Scl). The neoplastic cells also expressed hematopoietic stem cell antigens and receptors including CD133, CD34, c-kit, Scl, erythropoietin, and erythropoietin receptor. Under specific microenvironments, neoplastic cells (hemangioblasts) were expanded and differentiated into erythrocytic, granulocytic, and endothelial progenitors. Deletion of the wild-type VHL allele in the hematopoietic and endothelial progeny confirmed their neoplastic origin. CONCLUSIONS: The neoplastic cell of origin for CNS hemangioblastomas in VHL patients is the mesoderm-derived, embryologically arrested hemangioblast. The hematopoietic and endothelial differentiation potential of these cells can be reactivated under suitable conditions. These findings may also explain the unique tissue distribution of tumor involvement.

N2  - A case is presented with severe infra- and supratentorial subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) caused by intramedullary haemangioblastomas of the cervical spinal cord. The patient initially had a typical SAH symptomatology without neurological deficit. The cerebral angiogram was nondiagnostic. After admission the patient developed slightly progressive right sensorimotor paresis. Angiography of the cervical spine and MRI delineated three intramedullary haemangioblastomas. Retrospectively the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease was made by multiple haemangioblastomas and a positive family history. The three lesions were surgically completely removed.

N2  - AIMS: Chromosome 3p deletions and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for 3p markers are features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma but are rare in non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The VHL tumour suppressor gene, which maps to 3p25, is a major gatekeeper gene for clear cell renal cell carcinoma and is inactivated in most sporadic cases of this disease. However, it has been suggested that inactivation of other 3p tumour suppressor genes might be crucial for clear cell renal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis, with inactivation (VHL negative) and without inactivation (VHL positive) of the VHL tumour suppressor gene. This study set out to investigate the role of non-VHL tumour suppressor genes in VHL negative and VHL positive clear cell renal cell carcinoma. METHODS: Eighty two clear cell renal cell carcinomas of known VHL inactivation status were analysed for LOH at polymorphic loci within the candidate crucial regions for chromosome 3p tumour suppressor genes (3p25, LCTSGR1 at 3p21.3, LCTSGR2 at 3p12 and at 3p14.2). RESULTS: Chromosome 3p12-p21 LOH was frequent both in VHL negative and VHL positive clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However, although the frequency of 3p25 LOH in VHL negative clear cell renal cell carcinoma was similar to that at 3p12-p21, VHL positive tumours demonstrated significantly less LOH at 3p25 than at 3p12-p21. Although there was evidence of LOH for clear cell renal cell carcinoma tumour suppressor genes at 3p21, 3p14.2, and 3p12, both in VHL negative and VHL positive tumours, the major clear cell renal cell carcinoma LOH region mapped to 3p21.3, close to the lung cancer tumour suppressor gene region 1 (LCTSGR1). There was no association between tumour VHL status and tumour grade and stage. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further indicate that VHL inactivation is not sufficient to initiate clear cell renal cell carcinoma and that loss of a gatekeeper 3p21 tumour suppressor gene is a crucial event for renal cell carcinoma development in both VHL negative and VHL positive clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - Mutations of VHL (a negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible factors) have position-dependent distinct cancer phenotypes. Only two known inherited homozygous VHL mutations exist and they cause polycythemia: Chuvash R200W and Croatian H191D. We report a second polycythemic Croatian H191D homozygote distantly related to the first propositus. Three generations of both families were genotyped for analysis of shared ancestry. Biochemical and molecular tests were performed to better define their phenotypes, with an emphasis on a comparison with Chuvash polycythemia. The VHL H191D mutation did not segregate in the family defined by the known common ancestors of the two subjects, suggesting a high prevalence in Croatians, but haplotype analysis indicated an undocumented common ancestor ~six generations ago as the founder of this mutation. We show that erythropoietin levels in homozygous VHL H191D individuals are higher than in VHL R200W patients of similar ages, and their native erythroid progenitors, unlike Chuvash R200W, are not hypersensitive to erythropoietin. This observation contrasts with a report suggesting that polycythemia in VHL R200W and H191D homozygotes is due to the loss of JAK2 regulation from VHL R200W and H191D binding to SOCS1. In conclusion, our studies further define the hematologic phenotype of VHL H191D and provide additional evidence for phenotypic heterogeneity associated with the positional effects of VHL mutations.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is a tumor suppressor gene, which is widely expressed in the kidney, lung, breast, eye, ovary and cervix. Mutations of the VHL gene are able to induce VHL disease and tumorigenesis. However, it has yet to be evaluated whether the VHL gene is expressed in the human endometrium. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the VHL gene is expressed in the human endometrium and to identify changes in expression levels during the menstrual cycle. A total of 35 human endometrial tissue samples in the proliferative (n=17) and secretory phase (n=18) were subjected to the present study. VHL gene expression levels were assessed using Western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It was observed that the expression of VHL mRNA in the human endometrium decreased from the proliferative to secretory phase (P<0.05). Levels of VHL protein in the proliferative phase were higher than those in the secretory phase (P<0.05). In conclusion, the present study revealed that the VHL gene is expressed in the normal human endometrium, and its expression levels change during the different periods of the menstrual cycle.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to systematically investigate the clinical features, diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome in order to improve understanding of this disease. A total of 3 cases of VHL syndrome treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College (Zunyi, China) between September 2014 and October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The associated literature was reviewed, and the diagnostic and therapeutic features were discussed. Case 1 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by a renal tumor on the right side, and radical tumor resection in the right kidney was performed. Postoperative pathological examination indicated clear cell carcinoma. Case 2 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma. The left-side adrenal tumor was removed, and postoperative pathological analysis was suggestive of adrenal pheochromocytoma. Case 3 visited the hospital due to the presence of masses on the left and right sides of the kidney, but did not undergo surgery for personal reasons. Follow-ups were scheduled subsequent to surgery at another hospital. The diagnosis in all 3 cases was confirmed by genetic testing, where VHL mutations were detected in all patients. Following surgery, pedigree and genetic analysis was performed in all 3 pedigrees and VHL mutations were identified in 7 family members. The diagnosis of VHL syndrome should be based on the clinical manifestation of the patients and the results of genetic tests. DNA analysis of mutations is the main method for diagnosis. An appropriate surgical plan should be formulated based on the site, size and number of tumors, and the condition of the patient. Since VHL syndrome is an inheritable genetic disorder and relapse following surgery is common, pedigree analysis of the patient and lifelong follow-ups are essential. Additionally, physicians should pay attention to VHL syndrome in order to avoid missing diagnosis or misdiagnosis.

N2  - Significant improvements have been made during the last 20 years in therapy of renal diseases including the broadening of treatment options. Gene therapy is a potential modality for many renal diseases for which we are yet unable to offer specific treatment. Here, we introduce RNA interference (RNAi), one type of posttranscriptional gene silencing, as a novel gene therapeutic possibility and describe the mechanism and kinetics of action. We highlight the correlation between structure and efficacy of small interfering and short hairpin RNAs that are the most often used small RNAs possessing RNAi activity. Delivery is the biggest obstacle for RNAi-based gene therapy. Although hydrodynamic treatment is effective in animals, it cannot be used in human therapy. Possibilities to achieve site-specific and effective delivery are listed. Side effects of RNAi and potential solutions are also summarized. Besides the above-described world of small RNAs, we draw attention to the yet unrevealed function of human microRNAs that are localized mainly in the noncoding regions of the genome, are highly conserved among animals and possess important regulatory functions. Although there are many unanswered questions and problems to face in this new field of gene therapy, we summarize a number of experiments targeting renal diseases with the aid of RNAi. High specificity of short interfering RNAs and short hairpin RNAs raise hope for treating renal diseases.

N2  - Numerous studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, are determining regulatory elements involved in the pathogenesis of various types of cancer, including cervical cancer (CC). Although miR-21-5p upregulation has been demonstrated to associate with tumorigenesis by controlling the expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes, only a small number of studies have investigated the expression of miR-21-5p and its functional role in CC. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of miR-21-5p on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of CC cells, and the potential underlying molecular mechanism of these effects. The measurement of miR-21-5p levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that miR-21-5p was markedly increased in CC cell lines compared with normal cells. Upon silencing of miR-21-5p, a marked suppression of the proliferation, migration and invasion of CaSki cells was observed, with induction of cell apoptosis. These effects were reversed with miR-21-5p overexpression. A database search followed by a luciferase reporter assay ascertained that the 3'-untranslated region of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mRNA sequence was a direct target of miR-21-5p. Furthermore, silencing of VHL neutralized the effects of miR-21-5p inhibition. These observations suggested that miR-21-5p is an oncogene that is able to promote the metastatic phenotype of CC cells through downregulation of VHL expression, which may present a path to novel therapeutic stratagems for the CC therapy.

N2  - In this report we present two families with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. We operated on haemangioblastomas in two members, one from each, in our clinic. In the first family we saw 17 lesions in 9 members. Although in the first family carcinoma of the kidney was often observed, in the second family retinal haemangioma was found to be predominant, namely, in eight out of nine patients. In both families there were 11 patients with retinal haemangioma; of these, 9 patients were blind (82%). In 6 patients with retinal haemangioblastoma blindness was unilateral and bilateral only in one. All the patients with renal carcinoma were male and died young. In one of our patients with renal carcinoma we found metastatic lesions in the distal and proximal parts of the femur, vertebral arch, cranium and the thoracic wall. In these two families 23 members had 32 lesions, from which eleven were retinal haemangiomas (3 + 8), nine haemangioblastomas of CNS (5 + 4), one a renal cyst (0 + 1), eight renal carcinomas (7 + 1), two pancreatic cysts (1 + 1) and one liver cyst (0 + 1).

N2  - Accelerated glycolysis, a common process in tumor cells called the Warburg effect, is associated with various biological phenomena. However, the role of glycolysis induced by arsenite, a well-established human carcinogen, is unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as regulators in various cancers, but how lncRNAs regulate glucose metabolism remains largely unexplored. We have found that, in human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells, arsenite increases lactate production; glucose consumption; and expression of glycolysis-related genes, including HK-2, Eno-1, and Glut-4. In L-02 cells exposed to arsenite, the lncRNA, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)-alpha, the transcriptional regulators of cellular response to hypoxia, are over-expressed. In addition, HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha, is involved in arsenite-induced glycolysis, and MALAT1 enhances arsenite-induced glycolysis. Although MALAT1 regulates HIF-alpha and promotes arsenite-induced glycolysis, MALAT1 promotes glycolysis through HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha. Moreover, arsenite-increased MALAT1 enhances the disassociation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor from HIF-1alpha, alleviating VHL-mediated ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha, which causes accumulation of HIF-1alpha. In sum, these findings indicate that MALAT1, acting through HIF-1alpha stabilization, is a mediator that enhances glycolysis induced by arsenite. These results provide a link between the induction of lncRNAs and the glycolysis in cells exposed to arsenite, and thus establish a previously unknown mechanism for arsenite-induced hepatotoxicity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder that predisposes individuals to benign and malignant tumors in the brain, eyes, kidneys, pancreas, genital tract, or other body parts. The VHL gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 3, prevents cells from dividing too rapidly. Mutations in the VHL gene result in uncontrollable cell growth and tumor formation. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to summarize the current research literature describing diagnosis, treatment, and nursing implications of VHL. METHODS: Three electronic databases, relevant journals, and relevant websites were searched. FINDINGS: The majority of patients affected with VHL have an affected parent, but a small percentage develop VHL from a new mutation that takes place in a single egg or sperm during conception or from a post-conception mutation. Genetic testing, either through sequence analysis, Southern blot analysis, or quantitative polymerase chain reaction, is considered standard in evaluating patients suspected of having VHL. A diagnosis of VHL can be made by identifying one VHL tumor for a patient who has a confirmed family history of VHL. The presence of at least two tumors is required to make a diagnosis of VHL in a patient without a positive family history. The nursing role includes providing resources on VHL genetic counseling, genetic testing, and palliative care.

N2  - Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a master regulator of critical genes for cell survival under hypoxic conditions, is known to be related to tumorigenesis and progression of renal cell carcinoma. N-methylpyrrole (Py)-N-methylimidazole (Im) hairpin polyamides are synthetic organic compounds that recognize and bind to the minor grooves of specific DNA sequences. We synthesized three Py-Im hairpin polyamides targeting the flanking sequences of hypoxia responsive element (HRE; a binding site of HIF) in the promoter region of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene. The effects of the polyamides on HIF-induced transcription were evaluated by a luciferase assay using a reporter plasmid containing a VEGF promoter. Real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed to examine the effects of the polyamides on the transcription and secretion of VEGF in A498 renal cell carcinoma cells, which have a frame-shift mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau gene. A combination of three Py-Im hairpin polyamides suppressed HIF-induced transcription in reporter assays using 293 cells and successfully suppressed transcription and translation of the VEGF gene in A498 cells. Inhibition of the HIF-HRE interaction was confirmed by an electrophoresis mobility shift assay. An approach using Py-Im hairpin polyamides may be a new strategy for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - PURPOSE: Aberrant promoter methylation turns off gene expression and is involved in human malignancy. Studies show that first exon methylation has a tighter association with gene silencing compared to promoter methylation or gene mutation. However, to our knowledge the clinical importance of exonic methylation in renal cell carcinoma is unknown. We analyzed renal cell carcinoma for VHL gene exonic methylation using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 48 institutionally banked renal cell carcinoma patient tissue samples VHL exon sequencing was done as well as methylation analysis of promoter and exon 1 by mass spectrometry or conventional bisulfite analysis. Methylated human lymphocytic DNA (0% and 100%), nontemplate distilled H2O, and the UOK121 and UOK171 human renal cell carcinoma cell lines served as assay controls. Samples were considered hypermethylated if a CpG site showed greater than 50% methylation. RESULTS: Nine of the 43 patient samples read by our exon 1 assay had methylated VHL exon 1 sites, including 3 showing hypermethylation. The exon 1 methylation assay was robust and reproducible. Samples with exon 1 hypermethylation showed no exonic mutations. All samples assayed at VHL exon 2 were hypermethylated. CONCLUSIONS: To assay renal cell carcinoma tumors for VHL methylation matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry is robust and reproducible, and capable of quantifying the methylation status of individual DNA bases. Exon 1 methylation may be an alternate mechanism of VHL gene silencing in renal cell carcinoma in addition to mutation and promoter methylation. Applying this assay in patient populations may allow enhanced diagnosis or tumor typing in the future.

N2  - The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene product has a wide spectrum of tissue-specific functions, and specific germline mutations are associated with clinical phenotypes in VHL disease. In particular, missense mutations are correlated with the susceptibility to pheochromocytomas. An association between VHL aberrations and prognosis has been suggested in renal clear cell carcinoma but has not been studied in pheochromocytomas. We studied the frequency and spectrum of VHL alterations in apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas in relation to the clinical behavior in 72 patients, including 48 patients with clinically benign and 24 patients with malignant pheochromocytomas. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by DNA sequencing, loss of heterozygosity analysis of the VHL locus and immunohistochemistry for VHL protein expression were used to investigate somatic VHL gene alterations. In 2 patients, 1 with a malignant tumor, germline mutations were identified in the stop codon. Tumor-specific intragenic VHL mutations and accompanying loss of heterozygosity were identified in 2 (4.3%) of 47 sporadic benign pheochromocytomas compared to 4 (17.4%) of 23 malignant tumors (p = 0.064). Only one of these mutations has been previously described, in a renal clear cell carcinoma. Expression of the VHL protein was observed in all pheochromocytomas. No distinction in the nature of VHL alterations between benign and malignant pheochromocytomas and no correlation with histopathologic or clinical features was observed. We report novel VHL mutations in sporadic pheochromocytomas, which are slightly correlated with malignancy. VHL mutations may have some impact on the malignant transformation of pheochromocytomas.

N2  - Background: Germline mutations in RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndrome that is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia/adenoma. Recent studies suggest a "second hit" mechanism resulting in amplification of mutant RET. Somatic VHL gene alterations are implicated in the pathogenesis of MEN2 pheochromocytomas. We hypothesized that somatic VHL gene alterations are also important in the pathogenesis of MEN2-associated MTC. Methods: We analyzed 6 MTCs and 1 C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) specimen from 7 patients with MEN2A and RET germline mutations in codons 609, 618, 620, or 634, using microdissection, microsatellite analysis, phosphorimage densitometry, and VHL mutation analysis. Results: First, we searched for allelic imbalance between mutant and wild-type RET by using the polymorphic markers D10S677, D10S1239, and RET on thyroid tissue from these patients. Evidence for RET amplification by this technique could be demonstrated in 3 of 6 MTCs. We then performed LOH analysis using D3S1038 and D3S1110 which map to the VHL gene locus at 3p25/26. VHL gene deletion was present in 3 MTCs. These 3 MTCs also had an allelic imbalance between mutant and wild-type RET. Mutation analysis of the VHL gene showed a somatic frameshift mutation in 1 MTC that also demonstrated LOH at 3p25/26. In the 2 other MTCs with allelic imbalance of RET and somatic VHL gene deletion, no somatic VHL mutation could be detected. The CCH specimen did neither reveal RET imbalance nor somatic VHL gene alterations. Conclusion: These data suggest that a RET germline mutation is necessary for development of CCH, that allelic imbalance between mutant and wild-type RET may set off tumorigenesis, and that somatic VHL gene alterations may not play a major role in tumorigenesis of MEN2A-associated MTC. © 2006 Koch et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that recruit an E3 ligase to a target protein to facilitate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of that protein. While the field of targeted degraders is still relatively young, the potential for this modality to become a differentiated and therapeutic reality is strong, such that both academic and pharmaceutical institutions are now entering this interesting area of research. In this article, we describe a broadly applicable process for identifying degrader hits based on the serine/threonine kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and have generalized the key structural elements associated with degradation activities. Compound 3i is a potent hit (TBK1 DC<sub>50</sub> = 12 nM, D<sub>max</sub> = 96%) with excellent selectivity against a related kinase IKKepsilon, which was further used as a chemical tool to assess TBK1 as a target in mutant K-Ras cancer cells.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome with poor survival. Although the genotype-phenotype correlation has been described previously, little is known about the relationship between alteration in VHL protein (pVHL) and phenotypic diversity. Materials & Methods: We recruited 339 VHL patients from 128 unrelated families. VHL gene mutations were divided into 3 groups: missed mutation located in HIF-alpha binding site (HM group), non-HIF-alpha binding site (nHM group), and truncating mutation (TR group). Kaplan-Meier curve was used to describe the survival and age-related penetrance in different groups. Cox regression model was performed to evaluate age-related risks for VHL-associated tumors. Results: Patients with missense mutations conferred an increased risk of pheochromocytoma (HR=1.854, p=0.047) than those with truncating mutations. Stratifying missense mutations into nHM and HM showed that the risk for pheochromocytoma was lower in HM group than in nHM group (HR=0.298, p=0.003), but was similar between HM and TR group (HR=0.901, P=0.810). After putting HM and TR into one group (HMTR group), patients in nHM group had higher risk for pheochromocytoma (HR=3.134, p<0.001) and lower risks for central nervous system hemangioblastoma (HR=0.685, p=0.034), renal cell carcinoma (HR=0.639, p=0.036) and pancreatic tumor (HR=0.468, p=0.001) than those in HMTR group. Moreover, nHM group was independently related to a better overall survival (HR=0.345, p=0.005) and CHB-specific survival (HR=0.129, p=0.005) than HMTR group. Conclusions: The new genotype-phenotype correlation links VHL gene mutation, substrate (HIF-alpha) binding site in pVHL, and phenotypic diversity (penetrance and survival), and provides more accurate information for genetic consultation and pathogenesis study.

N2  - Genomic studies in the recent decades lead to the identification of new genetic mutations that have been shown to play detrimental roles in the formation of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. The majority of these genetic mutations detected affect two major cellular pathways - pseudo hypoxic pathway and kinase signalling pathway. Genetic mutations also resulted in syndromes related to paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. The classical syndromes comprise - neurofibromatosis, multiple neuroendocrine neoplasia (MEN) (II and III) syndromes and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Also, mutations in succinate dehydrogenase genes contribute to the understanding of hereditary paragangliomapheochromocytoma syndromes, Carney's triad and Carney- Stratakis syndrome. Lesions newly known to be associated with the genetic mutations in pheochromocytoma/ paraganglioma include gastrointestinal stromal tumour and renal cell carcinoma. Pathological features, proliferative index, genetic and biochemical parameters could help to predict the malignant potential of paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. Different predictive systems have been proposed and with the help of immunochemical studies. Pathologist should be aware of the advances in knowledge and contribute to the validation of the pathological features and markers for prediction of malignant potential of this group of tumours.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type (ccRCC) is associated with loss of functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein and high, homogeneous expression of the G250MN protein, an isoenzyme of the carbonic anhydrase family. High expression of G250MN is found in all ccRCCs, but not in most normal tissues, including normal human kidney. We specifically studied the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the CAIXG250 gene in RCC. Previous studies identified Sp1 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) as main regulatory transcription factors of G250MN in various non-RCC backgrounds. However, G250MN regulation in RCC has not been studied and may be differently regulated in view of the HIF accumulation under normoxic conditions due to VHL mutations. Transient transfection of different G250MN promoter constructs revealed strong promoter activity in G250MN -positive RCC cell lines, but no activity in G250MN -negative cell lines. DNase-I footprint and band-shift analysis demonstrated that Sp1 and HIF-1alpha proteins in nuclear extracts of RCC cells bind to the CAIX promoter and mutations in the most proximal Sp1 binding element or HIF binding element completely abolished CAIX promoter activity, indicating their critical importance for the activation of G250 expression in RCC. A close correlation between HIF-1alpha expression and G250MN expression was observed. In contrast, no relationship between HIF-2alpha expression and G250MN was seen. The participation of cofactor CBP/p300 in the regulation of G250 transcription was shown. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha and Sp1, in combination with CBP/p300, are crucial elements for G250MN expression in ccRCC, and CAIXG250 can be regarded as a unique HIF-1alpha target gene in ccRCC.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome (OMIM 193300) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by deletions or mutations in a tumor suppressor gene mapped to human chromosome 3p25. It is characterized clinically by vascular tumors, including retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas (cerebellar, spinal, and brain stem). Hemangioblastomas are benign and do not metastasize. Other features include cysts of the kidneys, liver, and pancreas. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma occurs in up to 70% of patients with VHL and is a frequent cause of death. Pheochromocytomas occur in association with specific alleles of the VHL gene; therefore, a family history of pheochromocytoma in association with VHL is an indication for thorough surveillance for pheochromocytoma in affected family members. Recently, it has been appreciated that patients with VHL may develop endolymphatic sac tumors, which can cause tinnitus or deafness. The diagnosis of VHL may be made in a patient with a family history of VHL based on a single retinal or cerebellar hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma or pheochromocytoma, and, possibly, multiple pancreatic cysts. Renal and epididymal cysts are not sufficient to make the diagnosis of VHL. In the absence of a family history of VHL the presence of two or more retinal or cerebellar hemangioblastomas, or one hemangioblastoma with one visceral tumor, is required for diagnosis. Studies of the natural history of VHL showed a life expectancy less than 50 years before surveillance protocols were developed. Annual assessments (physical and ophthalmologic examinations) should begin in infancy. Imaging of abdominal organs and the brain and spine should be added in teenagers and adults. Renal cysts and tumors should be monitored by computed tomography every 6 months. Mutation analysis has allowed presymptomatic identification of affected family members; those found not to have inherited the gene do not need to be monitored. The VHL gene coding sequence contains three exons, and two isoforms of mRNA exist, reflecting the presence or absence of exon 2. Tumors arise after the loss or inactivation of the wild type allele in a cell. About 20% of patients have large germline mutations detectable by Southern blot analysis, 27% have missense mutations, and 27% have nonsense or frameshift mutations. In about 20% of VHL families no deletion or mutation can be detected. Families may be characterized by the presence (type 2; 7% to 20% of families) or absence (type 1) of pheochromocytomas. Most type 2 families have missense mutations, whereas most type 1 families are affected by deletions or premature termination mutations. Prognostic counseling regarding the lifetime risk of pheochromocytoma can be aided by determination of the underlying mutation in patients without family histories of VHL. [References: 39]

N2  - A small subset of familial pancreatic endocrine tumors (PET) arises in patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and these tumors may have an adverse outcome compared to other familial PET. Sporadic PET rarely harbors somatic VHL mutations, but the chromosomal location of the VHL gene is frequently deleted in sporadic PET. A subset of sporadic PET shows active hypoxia signals on mRNA and protein level. To identify the frequency of functionally relevant VHL inactivation in sporadic PET and to examine a possible prognostic significance we correlated epigenetic and genetic VHL alterations with hypoxia signals. VHL mutations were absent in all 37 PETs examined. In 2 out of 35 informative PET (6%) methylation of the VHL promoter region was detected and VHL deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization was found in 14 out of 79 PET (18%). Hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1-alpha), carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA-9), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) protein was expressed in 19, 27, and 30% of the 152 PETs examined. Protein expression of the HIF1-alpha downstream target CA-9 correlated significantly with the expression of CA-9 RNA (P<0.001), VHL RNA (P<0.05), and VHL deletion (P<0.001) as well as with HIF1-alpha (P<0.005) and GLUT-1 immunohistochemistry (P<0.001). These PET with VHL alterations and signs of hypoxia signalling were characterized by a significantly shortened disease-free survival. We conclude that VHL gene impairment by promoter methylation and VHL deletion in nearly 25% of PET leads to the activation of the HIF-pathway. Our data suggest that VHL inactivation and consecutive hypoxia signals may be a mechanism for the development of sporadic PET with an adverse outcome.

N2  - Traditionally, surveillance against cancer was thought of as mainly immunological. With the exception of tumors with a clear viral involvement, such as immunoblastomas (Epstein-Barr virus, EBV), cervical, anogenital, and skin carcinomas (HPV), and Kaposi's sarcoma (HHV-8) where the immune system is confronted with virally encoded, nonself targets, tumors with no viral involvement provide poor targets. Attempts to influence them by immunological means are akin to the breaking of tolerance. Robust nonimmunological surveillance mechanisms include DNA repair-based checkpoint functions, and the triggering of growth arrest and/or apoptosis pathways by DNA damage or by illegitimate oncogene activation (intracellular surveillance). There is emerging evidence for epigenetic surveillance, reflected in the stringency of imprinting. A fourth mechanism, intercellular surveillance, or microenvironmental control, is rapidly gaining momentum. It can be mediated by contactual controls or by differentiation-inducing signals. Somatic hybridization experiments have shown that tumorigenicity is usually suppressed in somatic hybrids between normal and malignant cells, as long as a fairly complete chromosome complement is maintained. Individual normal cell-derived chromosomes may have a similar suppressive effect. For example, genetic and molecular dissection of human 3p that shows frequent deletions in many human tumors has identified multiple tumor suppressor genes, which can inhibit both in vitro growth and in vivo tumorigenicity. In addition, five genes were found with an "asymmetric activity," capable of suppressing tumorigenicity, without affecting in vitro growth. These genes, LTF, L1MD1, HYAL1, HYAL2, and VHL, are of particular interest because they may be involved in microenvironmental control. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Chuvash polycythemia (MIM 263400) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a high hemoglobin level, relatively high serum erythropoietin, and early death. It results from a Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutation (C598T) that causes increased HIF-1alpha activity and erythrocyte production in the face of normoxia. This polycythemia is endemic in Chuvashia, whereas its worldwide frequency is very low. We investigated the incidence of the Chuvash-type VHL mutation in Campania (South Italy) and identified 14 affected subjects (5 families). Twelve live on the island of Ischia (Bay of Naples). From analysis of the mutated allele, we found that the disease was more frequent on Ischia (0.070) than in Chuvashia (0.057). The haplotype of all patients matched that identified in the Chuvash cluster, thereby supporting the single-founder hypothesis. We also found that nonaffected heterozygotes had increased HIF-1alpha activity, which might confer a biochemical advantage for mutation maintenance. In conclusion, we have identified the first large cluster of Chuvash erythrocytosis outside Chuvashia, which suggests that this familial polycythemia might be endemic in other regions of the world.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is dominated by inactivating mutations in VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase), leading to constitutive activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and induction of a hypoxia response transcription signature. Our study demonstrated that VHL mutation results in the acquisition of ccRCC resistance to NK-mediated lysis by a mechanism involving EPAS1/HIF-2alpha stabilization. More importantly we identified ITPR1 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1) as a direct novel target of EPAS1 and as a potent regulator of NK-mediated killing through the activation of autophagy in target cells by a signal derived from NK cells. Therefore, it is conceivable to consider EPAS1 or the autophagy sensor ITPR1 as a potential target in future therapeutic protocols that aim to improve NK cell responses in patients with RCC and other solid malignancies.

N2  - The authors present the autopsy findings of two related patients and the biopsy findings of a third member of the family. The oldest member was 34 years old at death and on postmortem examination he had haemangioblastomas in the retina, cerebellum, medulla and spinal cord. Other findings were renal cell carcinoma, phaechromocytoma, cysts of kidney and pancreas, hydromyelia and atypical meningiomas. His brother died when 30 years old. The autopsy revealed haemangioblastomas of cerebellum, renal cell carcinoma and a clear cell cystadenoma of epididymus. The third patient was the daughter of the first and presented with headache and dizziness. CT-scan showed a cerebellar haemangioblastoma. Epidemiological considerations on the commonest visceral and CNS lesions and a review of current diagnostic criteria are discussed. [References: 27]

N2  - The pathobiology of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is hampered by the lack of scientific tools that define their mechanisms of secretion, proliferation, and metastasis; and, currently, there are no accurate means to assess tumor behavior and disease prognosis. Molecular biologic techniques and genetic analysis may facilitate the delineation of the molecular pathology of NETs and provide novel insights into their cellular mechanisms. The current status and recent advances in assessment of the molecular basis of tumorigenesis of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) were reviewed (1981-2004). The objectives of this retrospective study were to provide a cohesive overview of the current state of knowledge and to develop a molecular understanding of these rare tumor entities to facilitate the establishment of therapeutic targets and rational management strategies. Multiple differences in chromosomal aberration patterns were noted between gastrointestinal (GI) neuroendocrine and pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs). Divergence in gene expression patterns in the development of GI carcinoids and PETs was identified, whereas examination of the PET and GI carcinoid data demonstrated only few areas of overlap in the accumulation of genetic aberrations. These data suggest that the recent World Health Organization classification of GEP-NETs may require updating. In addition, previous assumptions of tumor similarity (pancreatic vs. GI) may be unfounded when they are examined at a molecular level. On the basis of the evolution of genetic information, enteric neuroendocrine lesions (carcinoids) and PETs may need to be classified as two distinct entities rather than grouped together as the single entity "GEP-NETs."

N2  - The RNA-binding protein HuR regulates the stability and translation of numerous mRNAs encoding stress-response and proliferative proteins. Although its post-transcriptional influence has been linked primarily to its cytoplasmic translocation, here we report that moderate heat shock (HS) potently reduces HuR levels, thereby altering the expression of HuR target mRNAs. HS did not change HuR mRNA levels or de novo translation, but instead reduced HuR protein stability. Supporting the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in this process were results showing that (1) HuR was ubiquitinated in vitro and in intact cells, (2) proteasome inhibition increased HuR abundance after HS, and (3) the HuR kinase checkpoint kinase 2 protected against the loss of HuR by HS. Within a central, HS-labile ~ 110-amino-acid region, K182 was found to be essential for HuR ubiquitination and proteolysis as mutant HuR(K182R) was left virtually unubiquitinated and was refractory to HS-triggered degradation. Our findings reveal that HS transiently lowers HuR by proteolysis linked to K182 ubiquitination and that HuR reduction enhances cell survival following HS.

N2  - Over the last two decades molecular studies of inherited tumor syndromes that are associated with the development of kidney cancer have led to the identification of genes and biochemical pathways, which play key roles in the malignant transformation of renal epithelial cells. Some of these findings have broad biological impact and extend beyond renal cancer. This review's focus is on the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) oxygen-sensing pathway and its role in physiology, energy metabolism and tumorigenesis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p25-26 is implicated in VHL disease. Two informative single nucleotide polymorphisms are at positions 19 and 1149 on the nucleotide sequence from Gene Bank NM_000551. In this study we examined the allele frequencies at these two loci in the Taiwanese population and compared the results to those from European ethnic populations. METHODS: The allele frequency was examined in 616 healthy individuals including 301 university students and 315 neonates. Both A/G polymorphisms were investigated using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis created by restriction enzymes, BsaJ I and Acc I. RESULTS: Among these subjects, the allele frequencies at 19 SNP and 1149 SNP for variant G were 0.130 and 0.133, respectively. And these results were significant differences from those of the Caucasian populations. In addition, 90% of the tested subjects had identical genotypes at these two loci suggesting the existence of nonrandom association of alleles. CONCLUSION: We found that the G allele frequency at these two loci in the Taiwanese population is much lower than that in people from Western countries. This phenomenon may be attributed to ethnic effects.

N2  - Hypoxia induces transcription of a range of physiologically important genes including erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor. The transcriptional activation is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric member of the basic helix-loop-helix PAS family, composed of alpha and beta subunits. HIF-1alpha shares 48 per cent identity with the recently identified HIF-2alpha protein that is also stimulated by hypoxia. In a previous study of hemangioblastomas, the most frequent manifestation of hereditary von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), we found elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and HIF-2alpha mRNA in stromal cells of the tumors. Mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene are associated with a variety of tumors such as renal clear cell carcinomas (RCC). In this study, we analysed the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in a range of VHL wildtype and VHL deficient RCC cell lines. In the presence of functional VHL protein, HIF-1alpha mRNA levels are elevated, whereas HIF-2alpha mRNA expression is increased only in cells lacking a functional VHL gene product. On the protein levels, however, in VHL deficient cell lines, both HIF-alpha subunits are constitutively expressed, whereas re-introduction of a functional VHL gene restores the instability of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins under normoxic conditions. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses of RCCs and hemangioblastomas demonstrate up-regulation of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in the tumor cells. The data presented here provide evidence for a role of the VHL protein in regulation of angiogenesis and erythropoiesis mediated by the HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha proteins.
