N2  - Various types of mutations exist that exert an effect on the normal function of a gene. Among these, exon/gene deletions often remain unnoticed in initial mutation screening. Until recently, no fast and efficient methods were available to detect this type of mutation. Molecular detection methods for gene copy number changes included Southern blot (SB) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation, both with their own intrinsic limitations. In this paper, we report the development and application of a fast, sensitive and high-resolution method for the detection of single exon or larger deletions in the VHL gene based on real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). These deletions account for approximately one-fifth of all patients with the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a dominantly inherited highly penetrant familial cancer syndrome predisposing to specific malignancies including phaeochromocytomas and haemangioblastomas. Our VHL exon quantification strategy is based on SYBR Green I detection and normalisation using two reference genes with a normal copy number, that is, ZNF80 (3q13.31) and GPR15 (3q12.1). Choice of primer sequences and the use of two reference genes appears to be critical for accurate discrimination between 1 and 2 exon copies. In a blind Q-PCR study of 29 samples, all 14 deletions were detected, which is in perfect agreement with previously determined SB results. We propose Q-PCR as the method of choice for fast (within 3.5 h), accurate and sensitive (ng amount of input DNA) exon deletion screening in routine DNA diagnosis of VHL disease. Similar assays can be designed for deletion screening in other genetic disorders.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is associated with various missense germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Some are associated with type 1 VHL disease, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) without pheochromocytoma, while others are associated with type 2A or 2B VHL disease, pheochromocytoma without and with RCC, respectively. These mutations may cause substitutions of specific amino acid residue and functional change of VHL protein (pVHL), which leads to the oncogenesis of the particular tumor types that characterize the different VHL disease types. To investigate, we transfected a pVHL-null RCC cell line with plasmids expressing wild-type pVHL (WT) or pVHL bearing 1 of 3 point mutations. These occur in the pVHL regions that bind hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha ) or Elongin C. Microarray analysis showed that the clones bearing a mutation in the elongin-binding region (mutant 167) were unique, as many more genes were suppressed than up-regulated. The other two mutant groups, which bear a mutation in the HIF-alpha -binding region (mutants 98 and 111), showed the opposite pattern. The 167 mutation is associated with type 2B VHL disease. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the altered expression of selected genes in the clones. Relative to WT, stratifin (14-3-3 sigma) and lysyl oxidase-like 1 were down-regulated in the 167 mutants, while the transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (beta ig-h3) was up-regulated in the 111 mutants. Thus, the location of pVHL mutations results in distinct gene expression patterns. Moreover, a mutation in the elongin-binding domain may induce type 2B tumors through different molecular pathways compared to those induced by type 1- or 2A-associated mutations in the HIF-alpha -binding region.

N2  - Cystic renal neoplasms represent an isolated cystic mass not accompanied by cystic change of the renal parenchyma. Although cystic change may be seen in any type of renal neoplasm, a few (i.e., cystic renal cell carcinoma, cystic nephroma, cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma, mixed epithelial and stromal tumor) are characterized by constant cystic change that may involve the entire tumor. Cystic kidney disease is characterized by cystic change, which usually involves the kidneys in a bilateral and diffuse pattern, does not create a discreet mass, and is due to hereditary or developmental conditions. Some of the cystic kidney diseases are not known to give rise to renal neoplasm; others such as autosomal polycystic kidney disease or multicystic dysplastic kidney may fortuitously coexist with renal neoplasms. Three conditions (acquired cystic kidney disease, tuberous sclerosis, and von Hippel-Lindau disease) are associated with renal neoplasms with such a high frequency that they are considered preneoplastic. This article reviews the differential diagnoses among cystic neoplasms. It also focuses on the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms for the relationship between cystic renal diseases and renal neoplasms. [References: 203]

Review of vhl, without case study of patients or mutations
N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with various tumors and cysts in the central nervous system (CNS) and visceral organs. Inactivation of the VHL tumor-suppressor protein and subsequent loss of function in the VHL, and Elongin BC (VBC) complex result in dysfunction in the ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which is an important step in the development of angiogenic tumors. The most frequent disorders in VHL disease are hemangioblastoma in the CNS and retina, pheochromocytoma in the adrenal gland, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Here, we review recent ideas on the pathogenesis and clinical diagnosis and treatment of VHL disease. Progress in molecular diagnosis and molecular targeting therapy is expected for improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. The family's support for patients with VHL disease is important, being mutually helpful to overcome various social and psychological problems in the patients. [References: 17]

N2  - Molecular genetic analysis of familial and non-familial cases of conventional renal cell carcinoma (RCC) revealed a critical role(s) for multiple genes on human chromosome 3. For some of these genes, e.g. VHL, such a role has been firmly established, whereas for others, definite confirmation is still pending. Additionally, a novel role for constitutional chromosome 3 translocations as risk factors for conventional RCC development is rapidly emerging. Also, several candidate loci have been mapped to other chromosomes in both familial and non-familial RCCs of distinct histologic subtypes. The MET gene on chromosome 7, for example, was found to be involved in both forms of papillary RCC. A PRCC-TFE3 fusion gene is typically encountered in t(X;1)-positive non-familial papillary RCCs and results in abrogation of the cell cycle mitotic spindle checkpoint in a dominant-negative fashion, thus leading to RCC. Together, these data turn human RCC into a model system in which different aspects of both familial and non-familial syndromes may act as novel paradigms for cancer development. [References: 114]

N2  - Hemangioblasts are capable of differentiation into vascular structures and blood. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease develop hemangioblastomas which are composed of VHL-deficient tumor cells with protracted hemangioblastic differentiation potential. In a subset of these tumors, hemangioblastic differentiation is characterized by different stages of red blood cell formation. It has remained controversial, however, whether VHL-deficient hemangioblastic cells are similarly capable of differentiating into vascular cells and functioning vascular structures in vivo. By histologic, immunohistologic and microdissection-based genetic analysis of 60 VHL disease-associated hemangioblastomas, we re-examined the controversial question whether VHL-deficient neoplastic hemangioblastic cells are capable of vascular differentiation (vasculogenesis). In most tumors (n=47), there was no evidence of either vasculogenesis or hematopoiesis; tumor cells were either scattered between reactive angiogenetic vascular structures or arranged in solid clusters. A subset of tumors (n=13), however, revealed vaculogenetic structures that were composed of cuboidal or flat cells and frequently contained red blood cell precursors or mature red blood cells. Microdissection-based deletion analysis of epithelial cells confirmed them to be VHL-deficient tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry for CD31 was consistently negative in these structures, and no evidence could be obtained for connectivity with reactive vasculature. We demonstrate that hemangioblastic differentiation capacity of VHL-deficient hemangioblastic cells includes not only erythropoiesis, but also differentiation into primitive vasculogenetic structures. Tumor cells, however, do not appear to have the potential of terminal differentiation into mature and functional vascular structures.

N2  - High altitude is accompanied by hypoxia. Acute and chronic hypoxia induces a number of compensatory physiological responses mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that regulate erythropoiesis, iron and energy metabolism, and other essential organismal responses. Excessive HIF responses occurring at high altitude may be accompanied by morbidity (polycythemia and pulmonary hypertension) or mortality (brain and pulmonary edema). HIFs are down regulated by two principal factors, i.e. prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and von Hippel Lindau proteins (VHL). Tibetans have lived at 3,000-5,000 meters for approximately 20,000 years and have acquired a number of beneficial genetic adaptations which appear to prevent negative responses to hypoxia at high-altitude. Deciphering these genetic changes is crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying hypoxia-mediated response mechanisms and to develop targeted therapies. We recently identified the first Tibetan-specific mutation, PHD2D4E, caused by a missense mutation (rs186996510) in EGLN1. PHD2D4E has an allelic frequency of ~85% in Tibetans and a low Km for oxygen, accounting for the protection of Tibetans from high-altitude polycythemia. Other effects of PHD2D4E on HIF-regulated pathophysiology remain to be delineated. A 77% GC-rich area surrounds rs186996510, resulting in a low success rate of detecting the mutation by Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing. PHD2D4E was unreported in published whole-genome analyses of Tibetans (Xin Yi et. al. Science 2010). Here we describe a high-resolution melting assay of a small PCR product for targeted genotyping of rs186996510. The single base-pair change (G to C) is visualized by melting small amplicons in the presence of a fluorescent DNA-binding dye. Heterozygotes are differentiated from homozygous genotypes by a pronounced change in the shape of the melting curve caused by the formation of heteroduplexes. However, wild type and homozygous variants are difficult to distinguish by melting alone, and require an additional step of a second melting analysis after mixing with known wild type DNA. Upon melting these mixtures, homozygotes appear as heterozygous melting curves, while wild type genotypes will remain wild type (Figure 1). We developed and validated a high resolution melting assay for rapid genotyping of PHD2D4E suitable for population and disease association studies. In our ongoing analyses, we genotyped DNA from over 300 Tibetans residing at sea level, 1300 meters, 1730-2300 meters and 4320 meters, and are correlating the allelic frequency of PHD2D4E with hematocrit levels. The high resolution melting assay for genotyping PHD2D4E is a simple, accurate, rapid, and inexpensive approach to identify SNP-targeted mutations, especially suitable for a large number of samples such as needed for population studies, without the expense and time required for sequencing studies. (Figure Presented) High resolution melting analysis of rs186996510 using a 48-base a pair PCR product amplified with primers Forward 5O AACGCTCTCACGCCGCCATGGCCAATGA 3O and Reverse 5O GCCGGGCCCGCCGCT 3O. Rapid-cycle PCR amplification and melting analysis were performed in a LS32 real-time instrument. Amplicons from homozygous, heterozygous and wild-type genotypes, and a mixture of wild-type and homozygous products were melted in the presence of a saturating DNA dye (LCGreen). High resolution melting curves and derivative plot are shown. Heterozygotes, or mixed wild type and homozygous variant produce a large change in the shape of the melting curve (red) in comparison to wild-type and homozygous variant (black).

N2  - Functional inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is linked to the development of several forms of cancer as well as oncogenic progression like sporadic renal clear-cell carcinomas (RCC). Despite the critical role played by VHL in destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha) via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, very little is known about the post-translational modification which regulates VHL activity. Our previous study showed that the SUMO E3 ligase PIASy interacts with VHL and induces VHL SUMOylation on lysine residue 171 (Cai et al, PLoS ONE, 2010, 5(3):e9720). Here we further report that VHL also undergoes ubiquitylation on both lysine residues 171 and 196, which is blocked by PIASy. Moreover, using a VHL-SUMO1 or ubiquitin fusion protein, we found that ubiquitylated VHL is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, while SUMOylated VHL results in increased VHL protein stability and nuclear redistribution. Interestingly, substitution of lysine 171 and 196 to arginine of VHL abrogates its inhibitory function on the transcriptional activity of HIFalpha, and tube formation in vitro. This demonstrates that post-translational modifications like ubiquitylation and SUMOylation contributes to VHL protein stability and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and that the overall function of VHL in tumor suppression may require a precise and dynamically regulated process which involves protein modification.

N2  - Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene VHL occur in various inherited and sporadically occurring tumors. The protein encoded by VHL--pVHL--bears no known enzymatic activities but interacts with numerous protein partners. With the identification of distinct pVHL-containing multiprotein complexes, a refined portrait of pVHL tumor suppressor function has arisen. In general, pVHL acts as a multipurpose adaptor protein that controls a diverse array of gene expression programs, as well as extracellular matrix assembly and microtubule-based processes, by linking various target proteins to appropriate enzymatic activities. These findings provide an evermore complex but coherent view of how pVHL functions molecularly and of the consequences of dysregulation of these diverse molecular activities on tumor formation.

N2  - Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) can remove covalently attached ubiquitin moieties from target proteins and regulate both the stability and ubiquitin-signaling state of their substrates. All USPs contain a conserved catalytic domain surrounded by one or more subdomains, some of which contribute to target recognition. One such specific subdomain, the DUSP domain (domain present in ubiquitin-specific proteases), is present in at least seven different human USPs that regulate the stability of or interact with the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1-alpha, the Von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), cullin E3 ligases, and BRCA2. We describe the NMR solution structure of the DUSP domain of human USP15, recently implicated in COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenic gene 9)-signalosome regulation. Its tripod-like structure consists of a 3-fold alpha-helical bundle supporting a triple-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet. The DUSP domain displays a novel fold, an alpha/beta tripod (AB3). DUSP domain surface properties and previously described work suggest a potential role in protein/protein interaction or substrate recognition.

N2  - PURPOSE: Retinal capillary hemangioma, often associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, is not characteristically seen in other conditions. We report a patient with Marshall-Stickler syndrome who had a retinal capillary hemangioma. METHOD: A 31-year-old man with Marshall-Stickler syndrome was evaluated for a retinal vascular tumor. RESULTS: Evaluation showed a retinal capillary hemangioma of the von Hippel type. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed no tumors of brain, kidney, or other organs. The retinal tumor was treated with cryotherapy. CONCLUSION: Retinal capillary hemangioma is not pathognomonic of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and it may be associated with the Marshall-Stickler syndrome.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Mutations in genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase and its anchoring subunits (SDH genes) are at the origin of hereditary head and neck paraganglioma (PGL) and a subset of apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. METHODS: We describe a family including three patients harbouring bilateral head and neck PGL diagnosed before 25 years of age. Multiple hypervascular hepatic lesions were subsequently discovered in two of them. In both, liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PGL. In addition, in one patient, MRI disclosed multiple target-like lesions of the spine, highly suggestive of metastatic PGL. Family history was compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance with possible maternal imprinting. RESULTS: Combined single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis followed by sequencing did not show any mutation of the coding parts of SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, RET or VHL genes. Screening of copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity in the three affected family members showed no deletion or amplification of the SDH, RET and VHL genes. Furthermore, succinate dehydrogenase activity measured in a liver PGL sample was not significantly decreased in the affected patient as compared with controls, underscoring the exclusion of the SDH genes. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported family of hereditary head and neck PGL with metastatic dissemination in the liver and the spine. A large body of evidence supports the absence of mutations in SDH, RET and VHL genes, which suggests the existence of a yet unknown gene at the origin of this particular form of familial PGL.

N2  - Inactivating mutations of the gene encoding the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) have been linked to an aggressive variant of hereditary kidney cancer (hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer). These tumors accumulate markedly elevated levels of fumarate. Fumarate is among a growing list of oncometabolites identified in cancers with mutations of genes involved in intermediary metabolism. FH-deficient tumors are notable for their pronounced accumulation of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and aggressive behavior. To date, HIF-1alpha accumulation in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer tumors is thought to result from fumarate-dependent inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases and subsequent evasion from von Hippel-Lindau-dependent degradation. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which fumarate promotes HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein accumulation independent of the von Hippel-Lindau pathway. Here we demonstrate that fumarate promotes p65 phosphorylation and p65 accumulation at the HIF-1alpha promoter through non-canonical signaling via the upstream Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Consistent with these data, inhibition of the TBK1/p65 axis blocks HIF-1alpha accumulation in cellular models of FH loss and markedly reduces cell invasion of FH-deficient RCC cancer cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate a novel mechanism by which pseudohypoxia is promoted in FH-deficient tumors and identifies TBK1 as a novel putative therapeutic target for the treatment of aggressive fumarate-driven tumors.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor syndrome. The incidence of VHL disease is assessed about one in 36,000 livebirths and the penetrance is higher than 90%. Similar to other tumor suppressor gene disorders, VHL disease is characterized by frequent development of specific types of tumors in selective organs. The disease is named after the German ophthalmologist Eugen von Hippel, who identified and described characteristic retinal manifestations, and the Swedish Pathologist Arvid Lindau, who discovered the frequent co-occurrence of retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastoma with tumors and cysts in visceral organs. He described the clinical spectrum of VHL disease in detail in a large series of cases from Sweden but also from other European countries. A clinical classification system divides individuals who are affected by VHL disease into two groups: Those predominantly without pheochromocytoma are classified as VHL type 1, and those predominantly with pheochromocytoma classified as VHL type 2. VHL type 2 is further subdivided into type 2A (with renal cancer) and type 2B (without renal cancer). In type 2C affected patients develop solely pheochromocytomas. Tumorigenesis in patients with VHL disease shares fundamental principles in the different affected organ systems: germline VHL inactivation leads to persistence of microscopic developmentally arrested structures. These microscopic cell clusters already reveal biallelic VHL inactivation and consequent up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor and down-stream targets like VEGF, EPO. Current research for pharmacotherapy of VHL disease targets proteins of the HIF cascade and compounds that lead to upregulation and refunctionalization of mutated VHL protein.

This study was initiated to investigate the 5' regulatory region of SFT and its role in the etiology of hereditary hemochromatosis. Sequence analyses of the putative 5' regulatory region revealed that the SFT cDNA sequence corresponds to intron 6/exon 7 of UbcH5A, a member of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which is involved in the iron-dependent ubiquitination of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. Further mRNA expression studies using a sequence-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay showed that UbcH5A is significantly up-regulated in the liver of iron-overloaded patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, as previously published for SFT. However, in vitro studies on HepG2 cells failed to demonstrate any significant UbcH5A regulation in response to iron loading or iron chelation. In conclusion, in vivo mRNA expression data previously obtained for SFT might be attributed to UbcH5A. The role of UbcH5A and the ubiquitination pathway in the etiology of hereditary hemochromatosis remains to be elucidated further.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited disorder predisposing to retinal and CNS hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pheochromocytoma, and pancreatic tumors. Interfamilial differences in predisposition to pheochromocytoma reflect allelic heterogeneity such that there is a strong association between missense mutations and risk of pheochromocytoma. We investigated the mechanism of tumorigenesis in VHL disease tumors to determine whether there were differences between tumor types or classes of germ-line mutations. Fifty-three tumors (30 RCCs, 15 hemangioblastomas, 5 pheochromocytomas, and 3 pancreatic tumors) from 33 patients (27 kindreds) with VHL disease were analyzed. Overall, 51% of 45 informative tumors showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the VHL locus. In 11 cases it was possible to distinguish between loss of the wild-type and mutant alleles, and in each case the wild-type allele was lost. LOH was detected in all tumor types and occurred in the presence of both germ-line missense mutations and other types of germline mutation associated with a low risk of pheochromocytoma. Intragenic somatic mutations were detected in three tumors (all hemangioblastomas) and in two of these could be shown to occur in the wild-type allele. This provides the first example of homozygous inactivation of the VHL by small intragenic mutations in this type of tumor. Hypermethylation of the VHL gene was detected in 33% (6/18) of tumors without LOH, including 2 RCCs and 4 hemangioblastomas. Although hypermethylation of the VHL gene has been reported previously in nonfamilial RCC and although methylation of tumor-suppressor genes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other sporadic cancers, this is the first report of somatic methylation in a familial cancer syndrome.

N2  - Despite the established role of SDHB/SDHA immunohistochemistry as a valuable tool to identify patients at risk for familial succinate dehydrogenase-related pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma syndromes, the reproducibility of the assessment methods has not as yet been determined. The aim of this study was to investigate interobserver variability among seven expert endocrine pathologists using a web-based virtual microscopy approach in a large multicenter pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma cohort (n=351): (1) 73 SDH mutated, (2) 105 non-SDH mutated, (3) 128 samples without identified SDH-x mutations, and (4) 45 with incomplete SDH molecular genetic analysis. Substantial agreement among all the reviewers was observed either with a two-tiered classification (SDHB kappa=0.7338; SDHA kappa=0.6707) or a three-tiered classification approach (SDHB kappa=0.6543; SDHA kappa=0.7516). Consensus was achieved in 315 cases (89.74%) for SDHB immunohistochemistry and in 348 cases (99.15%) for SDHA immunohistochemistry. Among the concordant cases, 62 of 69 (~90%) SDHB-/C-/D-/AF2-mutated cases displayed SDHB immunonegativity and SDHA immunopositivity, 3 of 4 (75%) with SDHA mutations showed loss of SDHA/SDHB protein expression, whereas 98 of 105 (93%) non-SDH-x-mutated counterparts demonstrated retention of SDHA/SDHB protein expression. Two SDHD-mutated extra-adrenal paragangliomas were scored as SDHB immunopositive, whereas 9 of 128 (7%) tumors without identified SDH-x mutations, 6 of 37 (~16%) VHL-mutated, as well as 1 of 21 (~5%) NF1-mutated tumors were evaluated as SDHB immunonegative. Although 14 out of those 16 SDHB-immunonegative cases were nonmetastatic, an overall significant correlation between SDHB immunonegativity and malignancy was observed (P=0.00019). We conclude that SDHB/SDHA immunohistochemistry is a reliable tool to identify patients with SDH-x mutations with an additional value in the assessment of genetic variants of unknown significance. If SDH molecular genetic analysis fails to detect a mutation in SDHB-immunonegative tumor, SDHC promoter methylation and/or VHL/NF1 testing with the use of targeted next-generation sequencing is advisable.

N2  - Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a rare autosomal dominant disease associated with tumors and cysts in multiple organ systems. The VHL disease gene is tightly linked to the polymorphic DNA marker 233E2 (D3S720) and flanked by 479H4 (D3S719) on its telomeric and RAF1 on its centromeric side. Two additional markers, D3S1038 and D3S601, have also been identified, and these markers, like D3S720, are very tightly linked to VHL. Previously 93 cosmid clones were mapped to the larger region, 3p24.2-pter, surrounding the VHL disease gene. Using a Southern-based screening strategy on pools of YAC clones we have isolated a contig of overlapping YAC clones that extends about 0.7 megabase centromeric, and about 1.3 megabases telomeric of D3S720 and contains all three tightly linked VHL markers. Individual YACs in this contig were hybridized to grids containing cosmids localized between 3p24.2-pter and to several cosmids localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to 3p25. A total of 28 cosmids were positioned on this contig of overlapping YAC clones. We have also identified homologous YAC clones to many additional cosmid clones localized between 3p24.2-p25, although these have not yet been precisely localized relative to the contig of YAC clones. This contig of YAC clones probably contains the VHL disease gene and should facilitate the isolation and characterization of this gene.

N2  - Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene are thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and VHL disease-associated clear-cell renal carcinomas (RCC). Differential display-PCR identified the AE2 anion exchanger as a candidate VHL target gene. AE2 mRNA and polypeptide levels were approximately threefold higher in 786-O VHL cells than in 786-O Neo cells. In contrast, Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange activity in 786-O VHL cells was 50% lower than in 786-O Neo cells. Since resting intracellular pH (pH(i)) values were indistinguishable, we postulated that Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity (NHE) might be similarly reduced in 786-O VHL cells. NHE-mediated pH(i) recovery from acid load was less than 50% that in 786-O Neo cells, whereas hypertonicity-stimulated, amiloride-sensitive NHE was indistinguishable in the two cell lines. The NHE3 mRNA level was higher in 786-O VHL than 786-O Neo cells, but NHE1 mRNA levels did not differ. AE2 and NHE3 are the first transcripts reported to be upregulated by pVHL. Elucidation of mechanisms responsible for downregulation of both ion exchange activities will require further investigation.

N2  - Hereditary cancer syndromes in children and adolescents are becoming more recognized in the field of pediatric hematology/oncology. A recent workshop held at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) 2012 Annual Meeting included several interactive sessions related to specific familial cancer syndromes, genetic testing and screening, and ethical issues in caring for families with inherited cancer risk. This review highlights the workshop presentations, including a brief background about pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes and the importance of learning about them for the practicing pediatric hematologists/oncologists. This is followed by a brief summary of the newly described cancer predisposition syndromes including Rhabdoid Tumor Predisposition Syndrome, Hereditary Paragangliomas and Pheochromocytoma Syndrome, and Familial Pleuropulmonaryblastoma Tumor Predisposition (DICER1) Syndrome. The next section covers genetic testing and screening for pediatric cancer predisposition syndromes. Ethical issues are also discussed including preimplantation genetic diagnosis or testing (PGD/PGT), suspicious lesions found on tumor screening, and incidental mutations discovered by whole genome sequencing. Finally, the perspective of a family with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome is shared. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Especially applicable for heritable neoplasia, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is possible for any Mendelian disorder whose gene has been localized, whether the molecular basis is known or not. METHODS AND RESULTS: PGD requires DNA from gametes (oocytes) or embryos before 6 days postconception, when implantation occurs. Approaches include 1) polar body biopsy, 2) blastomere biopsy (aspiration of one or two cells from the six- to eight-cell embryos at 2 or 3 days), and 3) trophectoderm biopsy, which allows recovery of 20 or more cells (20-50) from 125- to 150-cell, 5- to 6-day blastocysts. Of some 6000 PGD cycles worldwide, approximately 1500 have been performed for Mendelian indications. The approximately 25% live birth rates following PGD parallel the general U.S. experience for assisted reproductive technology. PGD has been accomplished for both cancer-specific disorders like adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), BRCA1, retinoblastoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), as well as disorders predisposing to neoplasia (Fanconi anemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome). PGD also makes possible the identification and, hence, transfer of embryos of specific HLA genotypes. This allows cord blood harvesting for stem cell implantation into a moribund child, often an older sibling of the fetus. CONCLUSIONS: PGD is a complex, but achievable, approach especially applicable to Mendelian forms of neoplasia. PGD is an attractive addition to the prenatal diagnostic armamentarium, especially relevant to heritable neoplasia. PGD also makes possible novel indications having special relevance to heritable neoplasia. [References: 26]

N2  - The six major genes involved in hereditary susceptibility for pheochromocytoma (PCC)/paraganglioma (PGL) (RET, VHL, NF1, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD) have been recently integrated into the same neuronal apoptotic pathway where mutations in any of these genes lead to cell death. In this model, prolyl hydroxylase 3 (EglN3) abrogation plays a pivotal role, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its inactivation are currently unknown. The aim of the study was to decipher specific alterations associated with the different genetic classes of PCCs/PGLs. With this purpose, 84 genetically characterized tumors were analyzed by means of transcriptional profiling. The analysis revealed a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-related signature common to succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumors, that differentiated them from RET and neurofibromatosis type 1 cases. Both canonical HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha target genes were overexpressed in the SDH/VHL cluster, suggesting that a global HIF deregulation accounts for this common profile. Nevertheless, when we compared VHL tumors with SDHB cases, which often exhibit a malignant behavior, we found that HIF-1alpha target genes showed a predominant activation in the VHL PCCs. Expression data from 67 HIF target genes was sufficient to cluster SDHB and VHL tumors into two different groups, demonstrating different pseudo-hypoxic signatures. In addition, VHL-mutated tumors showed an unexpected overexpression of EglN3 mRNA that did not lead to significantly different EglN3 protein levels. These findings pave the way for more specific therapeutic approaches for malignant PCCs/PGLs management based on the patient's genetic alteration.

N2  - The urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) system plays an important role in tumor cell invasion, metastases, and angiogenesis. uPA, uPA receptor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) are prognostic factors in different solid tumors, e.g., renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited cancer syndrome that is characterized by extensively vascularized tumors, including hemangioblastomas and RCCs. In 75% of sporadic RCCs, the VHL gene is also inactivated. It has been recognized in sporadic RCC that PAI-1 mRNA levels are up-regulated and uPA mRNA levels are down-regulated. We determined the role of the VHL tumor suppressor gene in the regulation of the uPA system in RCC. In 786-O RCC cells expressing the wild-type (wt) VHL gene, we measured a 3-fold higher overall urokinase activity than in 786-O cells expressing a mutant VHL gene or lacking VHL. uPA mRNA and protein levels were higher in cells with wt VHL compared with cells with mutant VHL or lacking VHL. In addition, PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels were dramatically increased in 786-O cells with mutant VHL or lacking VHL, compared with cells expressing wt VHL. Our results provide further evidence that the VHL gene plays an important role in the process of angiogenesis by regulation of plasmin-mediated proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and may explain why VHL-induced RCCs grow slowly and metastasize relatively late.

N2  - Decreased levels of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein are associated with up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), leading to increased tumour proliferation, angiogenesis and progression. The role of erythropoietin (EPO), a target gene for HIF, remains unknown for sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (sCCRCC). In this study, we determined expression levels of EPO, and its correlation with VHL mutations and HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression in 82 patients identified with sCCRCC following nephrectomy. We identified VHL gene alterations using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, purifying products of polymerase chain reaction, and direct sequencing. Immunohistochemical staining for HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and EPO was performed for tumour and corresponding normal tissues. Data were analyzed with respect to clinicopathological factors. EPO was detected in 87.8% of sCCRCC tumours versus 7.3% for normal tissues. EPO expression was related to tumours demonstrating VHL gene abnormalities. Of specimens with VHL alterations 95.6% tested positive for EPO, versus 78.3% when VHL gene expression was normal (P<0.01). EPO was identified in 96.2 and 94.2% of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha positive specimens, respectively, compared to 72.4 and 53.8% for HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha negative groups (p<0.01). Moreover, EPO expression correlated significantly with increasing nuclear grade (p<0.05). HIF-2alpha was identified in 84.1% of sCCRCC, compared to 64.6% for HIF-1alpha. Expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and EPO is common in sCCRCC. Although both forms of HIF up-regulate expression of EPO, the relationship to HIF-2alpha appears to be more pronounced. The VHL-HIF-EPO pathway requires further study, as it may represent a potential molecular target for therapy of sCCRCC.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD) is an autosomal dominant familial syndrome associated with multiple neoplasms. Medical management of pancreatic lesions is still controversial, especially for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET). We report an experience of total pancreatectomy for multiple pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in a VHLD patient, and discuss the indication of surgical treatment. The patient was a 33-year-old Japanese female with a medical history of VHLD-associated tumors. At 27 years of age, abdominal computed tomography revealed a number of strongly enhanced round tumors throughout the pancreas. She underwent total pancreatectomy with portal vein resection because of back pain and an increase of tumor size. Pathological examination reconfirmed the diagnosis of multiple pancreatic NET invading the portal vein. She has been well with intensive insulin therapy and has shown no recurrence of NET for more than one year. This is a rare case of total pancreatectomy with portal vein resection for treatment of pancreatic NET in a VHLD patient. Total pancreatectomy is a viable option for treatment of multi-centric or extensive pancreatic NET because of a favorable prognosis of NET after radical surgical treatment.

N2  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in controlling the level, activity and location of various cellular proteins. Significant progress has been made in investigating the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination, particularly in understanding the structure of the ubiquitination machinery and identifying ubiquitin protein ligases, the primary specificity-determining enzymes. Therefore, it is now possible to target specific molecules involved in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation to regulate many cellular processes such as signal transduction, proliferation and apoptosis. In particular, alterations in ubiquitination are observed in most, if not all, cancer cells. This is manifested by destabilization of tumor suppressors, such as p53, and overexpression of oncogenes such as c-Myc and c-Jun. In addition to the development and clinical validation of proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, in myeloma therapy, recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to develop inhibitors for specific ubiquitination and deubiquitination enzymes. With the help of structural studies, rational design and chemical synthesis, it is conceivable that we will be able to use 'druggable' inhibitors of the ubiquitin system to evaluate their effects in animal tumor models in the not-so-distant future.

N2  - Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling promotes tumor invasiveness in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other cancers. In clear cell RCC, VHL loss generates pseudohypoxia that exacerbates HGF-driven invasion through beta-catenin deregulation. Hypoxia also enhances HGF-driven invasiveness by papillary RCC cells, but in the absence of VHL, loss signaling integration involves three parallel routes: 1) hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species production and decreased DUSP2 expression, leading to enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade activation; 2) reactive oxygen species-induced diacylglycerol production by phospholipase Cgamma, leading to protein kinase C activation and increased protein phosphatase- 2A activity, thereby suppressing HGF-induced Akt activation; and 3) a profound shift from HGF-enhanced, proliferation- oriented metabolism to autophagy-dependent invasion and suppression of proliferation. This tripartite signaling integration was not unique to RCC or HGF; in RCC cells, invasive synergy induced by the combination of hypoxia and epidermal growth factor occurred through the same mechanism, and in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, this mechanism was suppressed in the absence of estrogen. These results define the molecular basis of growth factor and hypoxia invasive synergy in VHL-competent papillary RCC cells, illustrate the plasticity of invasive and proliferative tumor cell states, and provide signaling profiles by which they may be predicted.

N2  - Tumor suppressor genes have a diversity of functions, but they have in common the property of inhibiting neoplastic transformation. When they become inactivated, a constraint is removed that allows cells to grow inappropriately. Mutations in these genes are now thought to be the initiating events in most cancers. The first tumor suppressor gene was discovered through its role in retinoblastoma, and many other tumor suppressor genes also have important ophthalmic manifestations. The first group of tumor suppressor genes to be discussed are those involved in retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma. These are among the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer and are key regulators of growth and homeostasis. The second group of genes is associated with specific hereditary tumor syndromes with ophthalmic manifestations. These genes function in a variety of molecular pathways and are associated with neoplastic and non-neoplastic abnormalities in restricted tissue distributions. Research on tumor suppressor genes continues to shed light on the molecular pathophysiology of ophthalmic tumors and will increasingly yield diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a devastating hereditary tumor syndrome associated with various forms of cancer in multiple organ systems, including endothelial-derived tumors in the central nervous system, pheochromocytomas, and, a particularly frequent cause of death in VHL, renal cell carcinomas. Using DNA linkage analysis in a number of families displaying VHL, we recently showed that the primary defect in VHL maps to the short arm of chromosome 3. On the basis of the approximate knowledge of its chromosomal location, we have meanwhile bracketed this putative "tumor suppressor" gene to a small region of approximately 10 cM in chromosome 3p25-p26. The identification of closely linked flanking markers, together with the apparent genetic homogeneity of VHL, should allow for the development of a reliable diagnostic genetic test and provides the starting point for directed chromosomal "walking" and "jumping" toward the isolation of the defective gene itself. The characterization of the VHL gene should ultimately have important implications not only for patients with VHL, but also for a much larger number of cancer patients in the general population, afflicted with the sporadic counterparts of VHL-associated tumor types, such as renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - It has been documented that renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) occur frequently in patients treated with long-term dialysis, especially in cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)/acquired cystic disease of the kidney (ACDK). To address the molecular pathogenesis of ESRD/ACDK-associated RCCs, we examined 14 RCCs (7 clear-cell and 7 papillary carcinomas) in patients receiving dialysis for somatic mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) gene as well as of the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET oncogene. Direct sequencing analyses revealed that three tumors exhibited VHL frameshifts (618delA, 386-395del10-bp, and 723-724insTC). One of the VHL mutated tumors showed additional loss of heterozygosity at the VHL gene locus. Histopathologic and clinical data demonstrated that the three tumors having VHL mutations were clear-cell RCCs occurring in ESRD with 55, 106, and 156 months of dialysis history, respectively. We did not find any tumors with mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET. These results demonstrated that the VHL tumor-suppressor gene is also involved in a subset of clear-cell RCCs occurring in ESRD/ACDK, as in the case of sporadic clear-cell RCCs. However, mutations of the MET oncogene could not be found in the seven ESRD/ACDK-associated papillary RCCs examined.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease gene is a tumor suppressor located at 3p25-26. While amplifying intron 1 of this gene, a smaller-than-expected product was found. This fragment was sequenced and was approximately 78% similar in sequence to the VHL gene and completely lacked sequence from the intron. No stop codons were found in the sequenced region. Using this DNA fragment as a probe for Northern blot hybridization analysis, no evidence was found for expression of a unique RNA. Because of the lack of intron 1 sequence and the likely lack of expression, the new sequence is most probably a part of a VHL processed pseudogene. The putative pseudogene was mapped to human chromosome band 1q12 using the polymerase chain reaction with template DNA from human/rodent somatic cell hybrids, a radiation hybrid panel, and a set of primers that were chosen to be maximally divergent from the genuine VHL gene. The human/rodent somatic cell hybrid DNAs were then used on Southern blots to determine which human bands are from the pseudogene and which are from the functional gene. This knowledge is valuable in interpreting Southern blot evidence of VHL gene abnormalities.

N2  - Germline mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene may cause a variety of phenotypes including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, familial phaeochromocytoma and inherited polycythaemia. VHL disease is a multisystem familial cancer syndrome and is the commonest cause of familial renal cell carcinoma (RCC). VHL disease provides a paradigm for illustrating how studies of a rare familial cancer syndrome can produce advances in clinical medicin and important insights into basic biological processes. Thus the identification of the VHL gene has improved the diagnosis and clinical management of VHL disease and provided insights into the pathogenesis of sporadic clear cell RCC. Functional investigations of the VHL gene product have provided novel information on how cells sense oxygen and the role of hypoxia-response pathways in human tumourigenesis. Such information offers prospects of novel therapeutic interventions for VHL disease and common cancers including RCC. [References: 108]

N2  - The transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is an important regulator of cell-fate decision, including cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and stem cell renewal, and plays an ambivalent role in tumorigenesis as a tissue-specific tumor suppressor or oncogene. Here, we report that the Von Hippel-Lindau gene product, pVHL, physically interacts with KLF4 and regulates its rapid turnover observed in both differentiated and stem cells. We provide mechanistic insights into KLF4 degradation and show that pVHL depletion in colorectal cancer cells leads to cell-cycle arrest concomitant with increased transcription of the KLF4-dependent p21 gene. Finally, immunohistochemical staining revealed elevated pVHL and reduced KLF4 levels in colon cancer tissues. We therefore propose that unexpectedly pVHL, via the degradation of KLF4, is a facilitating factor in colorectal tumorigenesis.

N2  - Objectives: To describe the features, natural history, and management of an unusual manifestation of ocular von Hippel-Lindau disease in the form of fine vascular proliferation. Methods: Case series of 14 patients with definite or presumed von Hippel-Lindau disease. Results: Retinal vascular proliferation consisting of fine superficial vessels was found in 16 eyes of 14 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. The lesion was often found in a juxtapapillary location and associated with a fibrovascular component and/or a macular epiretinal membrane. In cases with follow-up (12 patients; mean [SD] follow-up, 10.9 [7.5] years), the lesion was stable in 7 of 13 eyes but showed growth and progression resulting in vision loss in the remainder. In 5 eyes, surgical intervention with pars plana vitrectomy, membrane peel, and excision of the fibrovascular lesion resulted in visual improvement in all of the cases. Conclusions: Ocular von Hippel-Lindau disease can uncommonly manifest as vascular proliferation that consists of fine, superficial, juxtapapillary vessels that are often associated with fibrovascular proliferation and epiretinal membrane formation. The natural history of this lesion is variable and can result in vision loss from tractional effects in progressive cases. Vision-threatening cases may be successfully managed by surgical excision. ©2008 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - It is well known that renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not sensitive to conventional radiotherapy or chemotherapy. High doses of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) and recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) are commonly used as the main treatment. However, the application of these cytokines is limited due to their toxicity and poor overall response rates. Recently, mutation in Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), Ras and PTEN genes have been observed in RCC. Several new drugs targeting these mutated genes and signal transduction pathways have been developed and have achieved favorable clinical responses. According to 2008 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, Sorafenib, Sunitinib and temsirolimus have been administered as first-line therapy. Bevacizumab is approved in Europe for use in combination with interferon-alpha as the first-line treatment for patients with advanced and/or metastatic RCC. Several other new targeted agents are still undergoing clinical trials.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma (PHEO) is considered to be a rare cause of hypertension. However, if left untreated, PHEOs may lead to fatal hypertensive crises during anesthesia and other stresses. The diagnosis of PHEO is therefore extremely important. A 24-hour blood pressure (BP) pattern per se might be of some diagnostic value due to frequently observed higher BP variability as well as an attenuated night-time BP decrease. So far, germline mutations in five genes have been identified to be responsible for familial PHEOs: the von Hippel-Lindau gene, which causes von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, the RET gene leading to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene, which is associated with von Recklinghausen's disease and the genes encoding the B and D subunits of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB, SDHD), which are associated with familial paragangliomas and PHEOs. Genetic analysis should be offered to those patients with confirmed PHEO who are 50 years old or younger. Plasma-free metanephrines or urinary fractionated metanephrines seem to have higher diagnostic values compared to plasma or urinary catecholamines for the biochemical diagnosis of PHEO. Imaging with (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine or (18)F-fluorodopamine PET, if available, are in addition to CT/MRI useful for the detection of multifocal/extra-adrenal forms. Appropriate pharmacologic treatment with subsequent laparoscopic extirpation of PHEO is usually successful in benign forms. There is, however, no convincingly effective mode of treatment in malignant PHEOs. [References: 26]

N2  - The ubiquitin-proteasome system has numerous crucial roles in physiology and pathophysiology. Fundamental to the specificity of this system are ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). Of these, the majority are RING finger and RING finger-related E3s. Many RING finger E3s have roles in processes that are central to the maintenance of genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis, such as the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), the SKP1-cullin 1-F-box protein (SCF) E3s, MDM2, BRCA1, Fanconi anaemia proteins, CBL proteins, von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL) and SIAH proteins. As a result, many RING finger E3s are implicated in either the suppression or the progression of cancer. This Review summarizes current knowledge in this area.

Cell line culture functional analysis; no patient data
N2  - Functional inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein pVHL is the cause of the familial VHL disease and the majority of sporadic renal clear cell carcinomas (RCCs). RCCs pose a significant problem for conventional cancer treatment protocols because of their highly recalcitrant characteristics to radio- and/or chemotherapies. In fact, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of VHL patients is RCC. Recently, global gene profiling of RCC cells has revealed that sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity is pVHL dependent. Here, we report that although RCC cells devoid of functional pVHL (RC3) were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha, reconstitution of these RCC cells with wild-type pVHL (WT8) restored their sensitivity to TNF-alpha cytotoxicity. The major TNF-alpha-inducible transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in the nuclear fraction capable of binding NF-kappaB-binding motifs was significantly increased in RC3 cells. Concordantly, the expression of NF-kappaB-target antiapoptotic genes c-FLIP, Survivin, c-IAP-1, and cIAP-2, which block the activities of caspases 8 and 3, were dramatically elevated in RC3 cells. Indeed, RC3 cells showed low caspases 8 and 3 activities. These results demonstrate that pVHL facilitates TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity in RCC cells, at least in part, through the down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity and subsequent attenuation of antiapoptotic proteins c-FLIP, Survivin, c-IAP-1, and c-IAP-2.

N2  - The Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology has developed a set of guidelines for pancreatobiliary cytology including indications for endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration, terminology and nomenclature of pancreatobiliary disease, ancillary testing and post-biopsy management. All documents are based on the expertise of the authors, a review of the literature, discussion of the draft document at several national and international meetings and synthesis of selected online comments of the draft document. This document presents the results of these discussions regarding the use of ancillary testing in the cytologic diagnosis of biliary and pancreatic lesions. Currently, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) appears to be the most clinically relevant ancillary technique for cytology of bile duct strictures. The addition of FISH analysis to routine cytologic evaluation appears to yield the highest sensitivity without loss in specificity. Loss of immunohistochemical staining for the protein product of the SMAD4 gene and positive staining for mesothelin support a diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical markers for endocrine and exocrine differentiation are sufficient for a diagnosis of endocrine and acinar tumors. Nuclear staining for beta-catenin supports a diagnosis of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm. Cyst fluid analysis for amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen aids in the pre-operative classification of pancreatic cysts. A number of gene mutations (KRAS, GNAS, von Hippel-Lindau, RNF43 and CTNNB1) may be of aid in the diagnosis of cystic neoplasms. Other ancillary techniques do not appear to improve diagnostic sensitivity sufficiently to justify their increased costs.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by development of cystic and tumorous lesions at multiple sites, including the brain, spinal cord, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, epididymis and eyes. The clinical phenotype results from molecular abnormalities of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, mapped to human chromosome 3p25-26. The VHL gene encodes two functionally active VHL proteins due to the presence of two translational initiation sites separated by 53 codons. The majority of disease-causing mutations have been detected downstream of the second translational initiation site, but there are conflicting data as to whether few mutations located in the first 53 codons, such as the Pro25Leu could have a pathogenic role. In this paper we report a large Hungarian VHL type 2 family consisting of 32 members in whom a disease-causing AGT80AAT (Ser80Ile) c.239G>A, p.Ser80Ile mutation, but not the concurrent CCT25CTT (Pro25Leu) c.74C>T, p.Pro25Leu variant co-segregated with the disease. To our knowledge, the Ser80Ile mutation has not been previously described in VHL type 2 patients with high risk of pheochromocytoma and renal cell cancer. Therefore, this finding represents a novel genotype-phenotype association and VHL kindreds with Ser80Ile mutation will require careful surveillance for pheochromocytoma. We concluded that the Pro25Leu variant is a rare, neutral variant, but the presence such a rare gene variant may make genetic counseling difficult.

N2  - Biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene, VHL, occurs in the majority of renal clear cell carcinomas (RCC). VHL's function, regulating the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha) subunits, explains the angiogenic nature of these tumors, but not tumor initiation. Because the development of renal cysts precedes tumor formation, and because the dysfunction of primary cilium is a common pathogenic mechanism in polycystic kidney diseases, we determined whether kidney-derived VHL- cells required VHL for the generation of cilium. Ectopic expression of VHL in RCC(VHL-) cells induced increased polarization and primary cilium formation. Cilium formation correlated directly with the expression of both wild-type VHL isoforms and a VHL mutant not associated with RCC development, whereas expression of RCC-associated VHL mutants did not support ciliogenesis. Requirement of VHL for ciliogenesis was independent of HIFalpha abundance. These data indicate separable independent functions for VHL (HIFalpha degradation and differentiation) and suggest a mechanism whereby disruption of both functions is required for renal carcinogenesis.

N2  - Ferrochelatase (FECH), the last enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin to form heme. This pathway provides heme for hemoglobin and other essential hemoproteins. The regulatory role of oxygen in the pathway has not been clearly established. In this study, we examined whether FECH gene expression is upregulated during hypoxia by a mechanism which involves the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Two HIF-1 binding motifs were identified within the -150 bp FECH minimal promoter sequence. Exposure of HEL, K562, and Hep-G2 cells to hypoxia for 18 hours resulted in a significant increase in FECH mRNA expression (p < 0.05). Hypoxia also transactivated the minimal promoter for the FECH gene in the cells. Transient co-expression of wild-type HIF-1alpha or a dominant negative HIF-1alpha with the FECH minimal promoter luciferase construct stimulated or blocked FECH promoter activity, respectively. Expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor factor blocked the expression of both FECH mRNA and HIF-1alpha protein during normoxic culture of renal carcinoma cell line (RCC4). The results suggest that the FECH gene is a target for HIF-1 during hypoxia.

N2  - Tissue hypoxia/ischemia are major pathophysiological determinants. Conditions of decreased oxygen availability provoke accumulation and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Recent reports demonstrate a crucial role of HIF-1 for inflammatory events. Regulation of hypoxic responses by the inflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is believed to be of pathophysiolgical relevance. It is reported that hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1alpha can be antagonized by NO due to its ability to attenuate mitochondrial electron transport. Likely, the formation of ROS could contribute to this effect. As conflicting results emerged from several studies showing either decreased or increased ROS production during hypoxia, we used experiments mimicking hypoxic intracellular ROS changes by using the redox cycling agent 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), which generates superoxide inside cells. Treatment of A549, HEK293, HepG2, and COS cells with DMNQ resulted in a concentration-dependent raise in ROS which correlated with HIF-1alpha accumulation. By using a HIF-1alpha-von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein binding assay, we show that ROS produced by DMNQ impaired prolyl hydroxylase activity. When HIF-1alpha is stabilized by NO, low concentrations of DMNQ (<1 microM) revealed no effect, intermediate concentrations of 1 to 40 microM DMNQ attenuated HIF-1alpha accumulation and higher concentrations of DMNQ promoted HIF-1alpha stability. Attenuation of NO-induced HIF-1alpha stability regulation by ROS was mediated by an active proteasomal degradation pathway. In conclusion, we propose that scavenging of NO by ROS and vice versa attenuate HIF-1alpha accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. This is important to fully elucidate HIF-1alpha regulation under inflammatory conditions.

N2  - Urological malignancies kill over 16,000 people annually in England and Wales. There have been exciting recent developments in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases, although many questions remain unanswered. Three separate genes (WT1, WT2, and WT3) have been implicated in Wilms' tumour development. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome develop renal cell carcinoma and it has been shown that VHL protein inhibits elongin, a cellular transcription factor which controls RNA elongation. Use of molecular markers to identify superficial bladder tumours likely to progress to muscle invasive disease has met with some success. Increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53 expression, and decreased E-cadherin expression all correlate with tumour progression. Tumours in patients with carcinoma in situ have distinct molecular features. Androgen ablation delays disease progression in men with prostate cancer, but relapse is inevitable. Research has been directed towards elucidating the mechanisms by which prostate cancer 'escapes' hormonal control. Mutations in the androgen receptor have been identified. It is apparent that locally produced growth factors mediate androgen-dependent processes and these too have been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. [References: 98]

N2  - Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta subunits, serves as a key regulator of metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. The amount of HIF-1alpha protein is regulated either by attenuating von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent 26 S proteasomal degradation or by enhancing cap-dependent mRNA translation, presumably involving a phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt-regulated pathway. In addition, it became apparent that Hsp90 protects HIF-1alpha from oxygen-independent degradation. Here we present evidence that PI3K/Akt is required for heat shock proteins to stabilize HIF-1alpha. In pVHL-deficient renal cell carcinoma cells, PI3K inhibition by LY294002 and wortmannin or transfection of either a dominant negative PI3K or a kinase-dead Akt mutant substantially lowered constitutively expressed HIF-1alpha without altering HIF-1alpha mRNA. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) such as PD98059 or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 showed no interference. Considering that PI3K inhibitors down-regulated heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as well as Hsp70 expression and moreover attenuated heat- or hypoxia-induced Hsp70 as well as hypoxia-induced Hsp90 up-regulation we conclude that PI3K inhibition promoted degradation of HIF-1alpha indirectly by reducing steady state concentrations of Hsp90 and/or Hsp70. HIF-1alpha co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp90/Hsp70 and direct binding of Hsp70 to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIF-1alpha was proven by a pull-down assay and a peptide array. PI3K-mediated degradation of HIF-1alpha was confirmed in HEK 293 cells under hypoxia, suggesting that heat shock proteins constitute an integral component for HIF-1alpha accumulation. We conclude that PI3K/Akt contributes to HIF-1alpha stabilization by provoking expression of heat shock proteins.

N2  - An autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is characterized by the presence of benign and malignant tumors. Hallmark lesions include retinal angiomas, hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum and spinal cord, and renal cell carcinomas. Affected persons may also have angiomatous or cystic lesions of the kidneys, pancreas, and epididymis, as well as adrenal pheochromocytomas. In this article, we discuss the clinical features and diagnostic criteria for this clinically underdiagnosed condition. An update on recent findings regarding the molecular genetics of VHL is provided, including a discussion of the evolving understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations. Understanding the molecular and functional aspects of this condition will lead to the development of strategies for the management and treatment of inherited and sporadic VHL-associated tumors.

N2  - Generally, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by a germline mutation of the VHL gene (chromosome 3p), and tumorigenesis is initiated from a "second-hit" deletion. A subset of VHL patients have a germline deletion of the VHL gene, and the molecular events leading to tumorigenesis are not fully understood. To determine the molecular pathogenesis of tumor formation in this setting, we analyzed five central nervous system hemangioblastomas from three patients of a single VHL germline deletion kindred, all displaying mild clinical phenotype. Rather than loss of heterozygosity (the "second hit" in VHL germline mutation patients), all tumors from this kindred showed "second-hit" point mutations on the wild-type allele. Moreover, in two patients who each had two hemangioblastomas resected each tumor contained a unique mutation. The specific germline deletion and the overall genetic makeup of the patient did not predict these random "second-hit" point mutations. These results suggest that in patients with germline deletion of a tumor suppressor gene there is a unique genetic mechanism underlying tumorigenesis. This unique genetic mechanism correlates with and may help to understand the mild clinical phenotype seen in these patients.

N2  - Sporadic phaeochromocytoma is an infrequent tumour during paediatric age and may or may not be associated with specific autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) type 2 or neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1. We report two cases of benign, adrenal, and unilateral phaeochromocytoma that clearly demonstrate the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of this disease during the paediatric period. The first patient presented a characteristic symptomatic form of sporadic phaeochromocytoma. The second patient, an incidental finding, was practically asymptomatic and had a de novo germline point mutation in the VHL gene (Arg167Trp). The frequency of de novo mutations in susceptible genes (especially the VHL gene) in paediatric patients with sporadic phaeochromocytoma and the elevated mortality of these cancer syndromes suggest that screening for mutations should be performed even in cases of non-familial sporadic phaeochromocytoma.

N2  - Purpose: We have previously shown that von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) regulates ubiquitylation and proline 1465 hydroxylation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, Rpb1, in human renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. Here, our goal was to determine the effect of this VHL function and the status of P1465 hydroxylation in human RCC tumors. Experimental Design: Primary human tumors and matched normal kidney samples were probed for expression levels of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Rpb1), Rpb1 hydroxylated on P1465 [Rpb1 (OH)], Rpb1 phosphorylated on Ser5 [Rpb1(S5P)], and proline hydroxylases PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3. Results from RCC tumors were categorized according to the status of VHL gene. Mechanistic analysis was performed in orthotopic xenograft model using 786-O RCC cells with wild-type (WT) VHL and knockdown of PHD2, characterized by high levels of Rpb1(OH) and PHD1. Results: Levels of Rpb1(OH), PHD1, and PHD2 were significantly higher in RCC tumors compared with normal kidneys. RCC tumors with WT VHL had higher levels of Rpb1(OH) and PHD1 and lower levels of PHD2 than tumors with VHL gene alterations. Levels of Rpb1(OH) significantly correlated with levels of PHD1 in tumors and normal kidneys. Knockdown of PHD2 in 786-O VHL(+) cells resulted in a more malignant phenotype in orthotopic xenografts and higher expression of specific cell cycle regulators (CDC25A, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, CCNA2) compared with VHL(-) RCC cells. Conclusions: Elevated PHD1 concomitant with decreased PHD2 are causatively related to Rpb1 hydroxylation and oncogenesis in human RCC tumors with WT VHL gene. Thus, P1465-hydroxylated Rpb1 and PHD1 represent attractive drug targets for new RCC treatments. ©2010 AACR.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression resulting from the uncontrolled migration and enhanced angiogenesis is an obstacle to effective therapeutic intervention. Tumor metabolism has distinctive feature called Warburg effect, which enhances the aerobic glycolysis rapidly supplying the energy for migration of tumor. To manipulate this metabolic change characteristic of aggressive tumors, we utilized the citrus extract, auraptene, known as a mitochondrial inhibitor, testing its anticancer effects against the RCC4 cell line. We found that auraptene impaired RCC4 cell motility through reduction of mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic pathway-related genes. It also strongly disrupted VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a), a key regulator of cancer metabolism, migration and angiogenesis that is stably expressed in RCCs by virtue of a genetic mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor protein, was impeded by auraptene, which blocked HIF-1a translation initiation without causing cytotoxicity. We suggest that blockade HIF-1a and reforming energy metabolism with auraptene is an effective approach for suspension RCC progression.

N2  - Genetically synthetic lethality occurs when an organism uniquely carries two deleterious, but non-lethal, genetic alterations, whose combined effects is to induce lethality in the organism. However recent usage of the term describes the pharmacological synergism that can be induced specifically in tissues that contain a unique mutation using inhibitors of a second gene product. The first successful clinical exploitation of such synthetic lethality, i.e. the use of that of PARP inhibitors to specifically target BRCA1/2 deficient tumours demonstrates the proof of concept that synthetic lethal relationships can be exploited. However as PARP inhibitors progress through clinical trials it is clear that the mechanism by which they work is not straightforward. Here we discuss the advantages of using synthetic lethality as a therapeutic approach. We discuss the discovery, development and mechanism of action behind PARP inhibitors and we consider what are the current gaps in our understanding of PARP biology that limit the potential of PARP inhibitors as chemotherapeutics.

N1  - Updated PMID;
Copy Number Variations, and relative amounts of A:T &gt;T:A and other transversions / transitions are described;
RNA from tumours was available for 92 patients (63 with WGS data), and from matched normal adjacent tissue for 45 of these (36 with WGS).
N2  - The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing worldwide, and its prevalence is particularly high in some parts of Central Europe. Here we undertake whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common form of the disease, in patients from four different European countries with contrasting disease incidence to explore the underlying genomic architecture of RCC. Our findings support previous reports on frequent aberrations in the epigenetic machinery and PI3K/mTOR signalling, and uncover novel pathways and genes affected by recurrent mutations and abnormal transcriptome patterns including focal adhesion, components of extracellular matrix (ECM) and genes encoding FAT cadherins. Furthermore, a large majority of patients from Romania have an unexpected high frequency of A:T>T:A transversions, consistent with exposure to aristolochic acid (AA). These results show that the processes underlying ccRCC tumorigenesis may vary in different populations and suggest that AA may be an important ccRCC carcinogen in Romania, a finding with major public health implications.

N2  - In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), inactivation of the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) occurs in the majority of the tumors and is causal for the pathogenesis of ccRCC. Recently, a large-scale genomic sequencing study of ccRCC tumors revealed that enzymes that regulate histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3), such as JARID1C/KDM5C/SMCX and MLL2, were mutated in ccRCC tumors, suggesting that H3K4Me3 might have an important role in regulating gene expression and tumorigenesis. In this study we report that in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells, the overall H3K4Me3 levels were significantly lower than that of VHL ++ counterparts. Furthermore, this was hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) dependent, as depletion of HIF subunits by small hairpin RNA in VHL-deficient ccRCC cells restored H3K4Me3 levels. In addition, we demonstrated that only loss of JARID1C, not JARID1A or JARID1B, abolished the difference of H3K4Me3 levels between VHL ++ and VHL-/-cells, and JARID1C displayed HIF-dependent expression pattern. JARID1C in VHL-/-cells was responsible for the suppression of HIF-responsive genes insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), DNAJC12, COL6A1, growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and density-enhanced phosphatase 1. Consistent with these findings, the H3K4Me3 levels at the promoters of IGFBP3, DNAJC12, COL6A1 and GDF15 were lower in VHL-/-cells than in VHL ++ cells, and the differences disappeared after JARID1C depletion. Although HIF2alpha is an oncogene in ccRCC, some of its targets might have tumor suppressive activity. Consistent with this, knockdown of JARID1C in 786-O VHL/ccRCC cells significantly enhanced tumor growth in a xenograft model, suggesting that JARID1C is tumor suppressive and its mutations are tumor promoting in ccRCC. Thus, VHL inactivation decreases H3K4Me3 levels through JARID1C, which alters gene expression and suppresses tumor growth. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - VBP-1 has been isolated as a novel protein binding to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene product. The fundamental function of the gene was examined in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). The C. elegans VBP-1 gene was expressed in adults only in the gonads and was also expressed in early stage embryos. Double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) against VBP-1 resulted in an arrest of embryogenesis at morula stages. This suggests that the VBP-1 product is necessary for morphogenesis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Von Hippel Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant multisystem/multitumoral cancer disease diagnosed by clinical, radiologic and genetic findings. Its prevalence has been estimated to be of 1/36000 inhabitants. The tumours can be benign or malignant. CASE REPORT: We represent MR findings of a family with ten children. Mother and five siblings had von Hippel-Lindau disease. CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic imaging is very important for the early diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic patients. Diagnosing it early is important because the tumours in von Hippel Lindau disease are treatable. Also, an early detection allows the patient's survival and quality of life. A multidisciplinary team approach is important in screening.

N2  - Hypoxia-regulated genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are both important for tumour progression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Drugs that block these and other pathways have been examined in Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC. Results from a randomised study of an anti-VEGF antibody demonstrate a delay in the time to disease progression, suggesting a biological effect and change in the natural history of the disease. Results using small-molecule inhibitors of VEGF, FLT3, KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, such as sunitinib, show a 40% objective response rate. Results from a Phase III clinical trial with sorafenib, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, show only a 2% response rate; however, a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival was observed. Objective responses have also been noted using an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin. Conversely, EGF receptor inhibitors, proteosome inhibitors, microtubule stabilising agents, cell-cycle inhibitors and imatinib were also examined with few objective responses. Ultimately, identifying the predictive factors for responsiveness to these targeted therapies may improve the clinical benefit; for example, RCC with biallelic mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene would have higher levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, and may be more responsive to inhibitors of angiogenesis. Phase III studies comparing the combinations of targeted therapy could lead to a new standard of care for RCC. © 2005 Ashley Publications Ltd.

N2  - The development of genetic testing has given patients with familial endocrine diseases the opportunity to be identified earlier in life. The importance of this technological advancement cannot be underestimated, as some of these heritable diseases have significant potential for malignancy. This article focuses on the identification and surgical management of familial endocrinopathies of the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas. Familial endocrinopathies discussed include hereditary nonmedullary carcinoma of the thyroid, Cowden disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, Carney complex, Werner syndrome, familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, Pendred syndrome, hereditary hyperparathyroidism jaw-tumor syndrome, familial isolated hyperparathyroidism, Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis I, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and tuberous sclerosis.

N2  - Inactivating mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene cause the VHL cancer syndrome and sporadic renal clear cell carcinoma. VHL engages in a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle, which is required for its function. Here, we pursue our investigation to identify mechanisms by which VHL-green fluorescent protein (VHL-GFP) is exported from the nucleus. We show that nuclear export of VHL-GFP in living cells requires ongoing RNA polymerase II activity, and is mediated by mechanisms that are temperature-sensitive and energy-dependent. In vitro nuclear export of VHL-GFP is inhibited by nuclear pore-specific lectins, requires ATP hydrolysis and polyadenylated mRNAs, and occurs with kinetics that are similar to those of proteins containing a nuclear export signal. Biochemical fractionation has revealed that nuclear export of VHL-GFP occurs by way of a Ran-dependent pathway. Size exclusion column chromatography and deletion mutant analysis suggest that VHL-GFP does not require assembly with one of its associated proteins, cullin-2, to engage in nuclear export. These results demonstrate that nuclear export of VHL-GFP is Ran-mediated and ATP hydrolysis-dependent. They also suggest that sequences outside the elongin C binding box may function as a nuclear export domain, potentially providing a novel role for this region of VHL frequently mutated in renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary, autosomal dominant syndrome which is manifested by a range of different benign and malignant tumors. This disease can present with different clinical presentations such as; retinal angioma (RA), hemangioblastoma (HB) of the central nervous system (CNS), pheochromocytoma (Pheo), and epididymal cystadenoma. Tumors are usually accompanied with cysts. OBJECTIVES: As the disease can display different clinical presentations, which are mainly unspecific, and considering the importance of an early diagnosis and the proper and early management of it, this study was carried out to present a general overview of VHL. Moreover, the present article reviews screening methods and emphasizes the need for increasing the awareness of different health care professionals to diagnose and refer the patients in the early stages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough search of internet medical databases, such as PubMed, was carried out on known or suggested; clinical presentations, pathogenesis, screening, causes and criteria for diagnosis of patients and their referrals. RESULTS: Our research demonstrated that VHL is caused by a mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. It also showed that different screening methods can be utilized for the early diagnosis and referral of patients. Different clinical presentations of the disease are also elaborated in some detail and their treatment options are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the need for a multidisciplinary approach to VHL, especially, given the number of cases which have been reported and diagnosed in Iran, it is of great importance that clinicians remain vigilant in order to identify cases that present with clinical characteristics of the disease, and that they are prompt in referring them to a multidisciplinary VHL clinic. It is also important to establish links with existing VHL Family Alliances and other related organizations around the world.

N2  - Germline mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) in humans causes a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by the development of retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas. Other tumors associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease include clear cell renal carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. Tumor development in this setting is due to functional loss of the remaining wild-type VHL allele. Biallelic VHL inactivation is also common in nonhereditary hemangioblastomas and clear cell renal carcinomas, in keeping with Knudson's 2-Hit Model of carcinogenesis. The VHL gene product, pVHL, is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the alpha subunits of the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factor for destruction in the presence of oxygen. Consequently, tumor cells lacking pVHL overproduce the products of HIF target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor alpha. pVHL has been implicated in a variety of processes that are central to carcinogenesis including cell-cycle control, differentiation, extracellular matrix formation and turnover, and angiogenesis. © 2001 Academic Press.

N1  - discusses pathways/mechanisms of VHL, but no patient cases
N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most frequent renal tumor and its incidence is increasing worldwide. Tumor angiogenesis is known to play a crucial role in the etiopathogenesis of RCC and over the last few years an even deeper knowledge of its contribution in metastatic RCC development has led to the development of numerous molecular targeting agents (such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, tivozanib, and dovitinib). The above agents are principally directed against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) members and also against c-Kit receptor (c-KitR). The role of c-kitR inhibition on clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the main RCC subtype, is less well established. Whether c-kitR activation through its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) contributes significantly to the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment remains to be established. It is important to underscore that the c-KitR is expressed on mast cells (MCs) and cancer cells. After an examination of the c-KitR/SCF pathway, we review here the principal studies that have evaluated c-Kit expression in RCC. Moreover, we summarize some investigations that have observed the distribution of MCs in primary renal cancer and in adjacent normal tissue with appropriate histological immunohistochemical techniques. We also focus on few studies that have evaluated the correlation between RCC proliferation, MC count and microvessel density (MVD), as hallmarks of tumor angiogenesis. Thus, the aim of this review of the literature is to clarify if c-KitR expression, MC count and MVD could have prognostic significance and the possible predictive therapeutic implications in RCC. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - The authors describe the case of a patient with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease in which a spinal hemangioblastoma contained metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The literature on tumor-to-tumor metastasis associated with VHL disease of the central nervous system (CNS) is reviewed. Midthoracic back pain developed in this 43-year-old man with a left-sided radicular component 2 years after he underwent resection of a left RCC. Radiological findings demonstrated a T6-7 intradural intramedullary lesion. A T5-8 laminectomy and gross-total resection of the spinal cord mass were performed. Light and electron microscopic examination showed features of hemangioblastoma, which contained metastatic foci of RCC. Genetic analysis demonstrated the presence of a deleting mutation in the first exon (nt. 394-406) of the VHL locus, truncating 16 amino acids (N61-77) from the first beta sheet in the VHL protein. A review of the literature revealed that RCC-to-CNS hemangioblastoma is the second most common donor-recipient tumor association among the tumor-to-tumor metastases.

N2  - Approximately 50% of patients with non-syndromic familial pheochromocytomas had germline von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations, but no reports on the subject were available in China. A total of five unrelated Chinese families with non-syndromic familial pheochromocytomas were screened for VHL gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent direct sequencing. Missense germline mutations of VHL gene were detected in four of the five families. Arg161Gln (695G-A) mutation was found in two families, and the other two families had Leu163Phe (700C-T) and Arg167Trp (712C-T) mutation, respectively. In conclusion, VHL gene may have frequent mutation in Chinese patients with non-syndromic familial pheochromocytomas.

N2  - Capillary hemangioblastoma (CHB) is a benign, highly vascularized tumor that generally occurs in central nervous system either in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease or, more often, as a solitary sporadic lesion that is increasingly recognized in extraneural sites. We present the case of a 18 year-old man with abdominal pain, nausea and hematemesis, the endoscopy showed polypoid tumor bleeding of 5 cm in gastric antrum. The patients had not signs of VHL disease and was subjected to subtotal gastrectomy and referred to our institution. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of CHB occurring in stomach.

N2  - Fifty individuals in nine families had von Hippel-Lindau disease. Nearly all of the morbidity and mortality of the entity is associated with six of its manifestations, each of which can be successfully treated. Retinal angiomatosis, which occurs in more than half of those affected, can produce blindness if not treated. Cerebellar hemangioblastoma, which is observed in one third of patients, is the most common source of initial symptoms and caused more than half of the deaths in the series. Medullary and spinal hemangioblastomas occur infrequently. Pheochromocytoma is common in certain families and is usually bilateral. Renal cell carcinoma, which generally arises at a later age, may befall the patient who is successfully treated for the tumors that occurred earlier. However, this tumor can be treated also, if there is early detection.

N2  - Haemangioblastomas of the CNS are a cardinal feature of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a dominantly inherited multisystem familial cancer syndrome caused by germline mutation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene. We investigated the frequency of VHL mutations in 188 patients presenting with a single haemangioblastoma, no family history of VHL disease and no evidence of retinal or abdominal manifestations of the disease at the time of diagnosis. We found that approximately 4% of patients had a detectable VHL mutation and all of these cases presented age 40 years or less. Although the identification of a germline VHL mutation has important consequences for the patient (e.g. risk of further CNS and extra-CNS tumours) and their relatives, four patients had germline VHL missense mutations [C162Y, D179N and R200W (two patients)] that may represent haemangioblastoma-only and/or low penetrance mutations. Approximately 5% of patients without a detectable VHL mutation subsequently developed a further 'VHL type tumour' (in most cases a further CNS haemangioblastoma). These findings suggest that a subset of patients with apparently sporadic CNS haemangioblastoma will have a germline VHL mutation but may not be at risk for developing classical VHL disease and a further group may be mosaic for a germline VHL mutation that cannot be detected in blood cells.

N2  - Well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) comprise ~1-3% of pancreatic neoplasms. Although long considered as reasonably benign lesions, PanNETs have considerable malignant potential, with a 5-year survival of ~65% and a 10-year survival of 45% for resected lesions. As PanNETs have a low incidence, they have been understudied, with few advances made until the completion of their exomic sequencing in the past year. In this Review, we summarize some of the latest insights into the genetics of PanNETs, and their probable implications in the context of prognosis and therapy. In particular, we discuss two genes (DAXX and ATRX) that have collectively been identified as mutated in >40% of PanNETs, and the biological and prognostic implications of these novel mutations. The identification of recurrent somatic mutations within the mTOR signaling pathway and the therapeutic implications for personalized therapy in patients with PanNETs are also discussed. Finally, this Review outlines state-of-the-art advances in the biology of PanNETs that are of emerging translational importance. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder causing hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system (CNS), retinal hemangiomas, renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, pancreatic and liver cysts, and epididymal cystadenomas. PURPOSE: Since 1976, we have periodically screened for the lesions in a large affected family and were able to evaluate new strategies in detection and treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 23 individuals underwent the screening program. A multidisciplinary team of physicians was involved. RESULTS: In 13 patients (7 females and 6 males), a total of 31 tumors was detected; hemangioblastoma of the CNS (9), retinal angioma (4), renal involvement (8), pheochromocytoma (4), pancreatic lesions (4), and liver lesions (2) were diagnosed by periodic family screening. On the basis of more than 10 years of experience and current literature, new criteria for diagnosis and treatment have been proposed. CONCLUSION: The von Hippel-Lindau disease gene appears to be a tumor suppressor gene, and its absence or a defect in its structure is responsible for the predisposition to the disease. Tumor development depends on a somatic second mutation in the homologous allele. That means, in disease-gene carriers, tumor growth may begin at any age. Most of the lesions can be treated successfully when diagnosed in time. Periodic screening by a multidisciplinary team has to be continued lifelong. [References: 72]

N2  - The phakomatoses appear to represent a group of disorders characterized, in part, by the common features of neuroectodermal mal-development, undecided differentiation of cells, and disturbed patterns of cell migration. With progress in genetics and cell biology, the precise deficits in the genome and the specific biochemical abnormalities associated with these defects will be elucidated. It is expected that the apparent diversity of these lesions will then be understood as a coherent series of missteps along the common pathway of normal growth and development. [References: 110]

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a genome "gatekeeper'' role and controls several downstream effector genes. We have previously demonstrated that both in vivo and in vitro adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of tumor suppressor genes into the vascular endothelium is effective in decreasing neointimal hyperplasia and abnormal cell proliferation. The degree of apoptosis induced by these genes is critical in mediating the in vivo responses to gene therapy and the maintenance of the crucial balance between cell death and viability. Since VHL gene is known to regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as other angiogenic factors, it may exhibit a greater potential in the attenuation of vascular disorders in comparison to other tumor suppressor genes. This study focused on whether adenovirus-mediated VHL gene transfer into human vascular smooth muscle cells has an effect on cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were grown as monolayers and transfected with varying titers of adenovirus containing the VHL cDNA (AdVHL). The negative controls were adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein (AdGFP), vector alone (AdNull), and virus-free infection medium. Adenovirus encoding wild-type p53 (Adp53) was used as positive control. Cell viability and proliferation were determined by using trypan blue exclusion and MTS-based CellTiter 96 AQ Proliferation Assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay, morphologic changes, and nucleosomal DNA degradation. Following AdVHL transfection HASMCs demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in viability as compared to negative controls (p < 0.05). AdVHL-transfected cells exhibited a decrease in their proliferative ability by 40.21 +/-1.66 (SEM)%. In cultures transfected with the positive control, Adp53, the cell viability as well as proliferation was highly reduced (p < 0.001). AdGFP and AdNull did not increase HASMC apoptosis above baseline levels. The cells exposed to adenoviruses expressing tumor suppressor genes underwent apoptosis, with Adp53 demonstrating a very high magnitude of cell death (75.27 +/-3.52 [SEM]%). AdVHL expression caused 45.36 +/-2.55 (SEM)% apoptosis in HASMC. Recombinant adenovirus-mediated VHL expression is efficacious in limiting vascular smooth muscle cell growth in vitro. Overexpression of VHL suppresses HASMC proliferation and regulates apoptosis. Further experiments are indicated to examine whether VHL may be a useful adjunct in limiting myointimal hyperplasia.
