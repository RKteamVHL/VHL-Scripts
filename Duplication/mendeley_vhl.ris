AB  - There is no standard treatment for metastatic chromophobe renal cell cancer (chRCC). Analysis of chRCC samples in this study yielded information about important genetic aberrations. This information can be used formulate newer therapeutic approaches and to design future clinical trials in chRCC. Metastatic chromophobe renal cell cancer (chRCC) is a rare subtype of RCC with no standard treatment. We performed molecular profiling of 12 chRCC cases to identify alterations predictive of response to therapy. Tests included immunohistochemistry assays, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and next-generation sequencing. Analysis identified c-KIT overexpression in 6/9 (67%) samples analyzed, and loss of protein expression of RRM1 and MGMT in 11/12 (92%) and of PTEN in 7/12 samples (58%). Mutations of TP53, PTEN, APC, and VHL genes were identified. In summary, molecular profiling of chRCC identified alterations in genes and protein expression that might provide a mechanistic rationale for off-label use of approved therapies in advanced chRCC, and could guide the design of molecularly targeted clinical trials. Patient Summary: In this study, we evaluated samples of a rare type of kidney cancer (chromophobe type) and identified potential genetic markers that could be used to individualize treatment and possibly improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Differentiation between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from benign mimickers is a well-known problem in cytological materials. Recent studies incorporated biological markers into this question and some studies showed that expression of S100P, IMP3, and maspin as well as nonexpression of von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) were significantly correlated with PDAC. In this study, we aimed to investigate diagnostic value of maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL immunostaining in fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of pancreatic lesions.
Materials and Method: In all, 33 cases of FNAB cell blocks of PDAC and 34 cases of surgical non-neoplastic pancreas specimens which were retrieved from the archives slides from 2007 to 2011 were included in this study. All the cases were stained with maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL. Expression patterns of markers were scored and compared with benign mimickers. Test performance of each antibody and possible antibody combinations were also evaluated.
Results: The study was composed of 33 PDAC and 34 control cases (8 chronic pancreatitis, 3 mucinous cystic neoplasm, and 23 nontumoral pancreatic tissue of PDAC). Diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy in S100P, IMP3, and maspin was 84.8%, 81.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. Specificity of these three markers was 100%. Sensitivity and specificity of pVHL for detecting nontumoral pancreatic tissue were 100% and 81.8%, respectively. When maspin, IMP3, and S100P expression were used together as triple test, sensitivity was 62.5% and specificity 100%. However, when any two of each three markers were evaluated (triple test/dual response), sensitivity reached 93.8% and specificity 100%.
Conclusion: We observed that dual response in triple test (positive staining with two of these three markers) of maspin, IMP3, and S100P immunocytochemistry is very sensitive and specific in differential diagnosis of PDA and non-neoplastic pancreatic lesions. pVHL may have an additional role, when triple assessment is not satisfactory.

AB  - The von Hippel Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL) protein is essential for proper placental development and is downregulated in preeclampsia (PE), a devastating disorder of pregnancy typified by chronic hypoxia. To date, knowledge on VHL genetic and epigenetic regulation is restricted to inactivating mutations and loss-of-heterozygosity in renal cell carcinomas. Herein, we sought to examine whether VHL DNA is subject to differential methylation, and if so, whether it is altered in early-onset PE (E-PE). Sodium bisulfite modification and methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed that VHL is subject to extensive methylation in a CpG-rich region within its promoter in the human placenta. Notably, we detected significant differences in methylation in E-PE placentae relative to normotensive age-matched controls at key transcription factor binding sites, including that of the transcriptional repressor E2F4. Treatment of JEG3 cells with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, revealed that loss of DNA methylation promoted VHL transcription by attenuating VHL association with E2F4. RNAi knockdown of E2F4 in vitro confirmed its function on VHL repression. Exposure of JEG3 cells to transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) downregulated VHL mRNA. In line with elevated levels of TGFbeta3 in E-PE, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that E2F4-VHL association was enhanced upon TGFbeta3 treatment, indicative of VHL transcriptional inhibition. In line with decreased VHL expression in E-PE, augmented E2F4-VHL association was also observed in E-PE placental tissue relative to controls. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that hypomethylation of VHL DNA at a key transcription factor binding site has significant consequences for its transcriptional repression in early-onset preeclampsia.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary tumor syndrome in which carriers are at an increased risk of developing a variety of tumors in multiple organ systems. A clinical diagnosis of VHL is determined by the presence of specific clinical manifestations while a molecular genetic diagnosis results from a pathogenic variant in the VHL gene. The majority of mutations occur in VHL coding exons and DNA analysis of these regions has a reported sensitivity of nearly 100%. However, rare variants in the VHL gene promoter may be detected in some cases of suspected VHL disease. We report two cases where VHL promoter variants were detected and describe the role of multi-step mRNA and protein analysis in the diagnostic evaluation of these cases.

AB  - The concept of cancer hallmarks is considered a major generalization of the principles of cancer biology. Many refinements of this concept were proposed based on the novel findings regarding the molecular and cellular features of cancer cells elucidated since 2000. Furthermore, in the last decade the rapid development of high-throughput omics technologies provided unprecedented insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cell populations. Here, we proposed an extension of the cancer hallmarks concept based on the recent refinements of our understating of evolutionary mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the seventh most frequently diagnosed tumor in adults in Europe and represents approximately 2.5% of cancer deaths. The molecular biology underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) development and progression has been a key milestone in the management of this type of tumor. The discovery of Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene alterations that arouse in 50% of ccRCC patients, leads the identification of an intracellular accumulation of HIF and, consequently an increase of VEGFR expression. This change in cell biology represents a new paradigm in the treatment of metastatic renal cancer by targeting angiogenesis. Currently, there are multiple therapeutic drugs available for advanced disease, including therapies against VEGFR with successful results in patients' survival. Other tyrosine kinases' pathways, including PDGFR, Axl or MET have emerged as key signaling pathways involved in RCC biology. Indeed, promising new drugs targeting those tyrosine kinases have exhibited outstanding efficacy. In this review we aim to present an overview of the central role of these tyrosine kinases' activities in relevant biological processes for kidney cancer and their usefulness in RCC targeted therapy development. In the immunotherapy era, angiogenesis is still an "old guy" that the medical community is trying to fight using "new bullets".

AB  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder that confers a lifelong risk for developing both benign and malignant tumours in multiple organs. Recent evidence suggests that vHL may exhibit genetic anticipation (GA). The aim of this study was to determine if GA occurs in vHL, and if telomere shortening may be a factor in GA.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of vHL families seen at The Hospital for Sick Children between 1984 and 2016 was performed. Age of onset (AOO, defined as the age of first physician-diagnosed vHL-related manifestation) was confirmed for 96 patients from 20 unrelated families (80 clinically affected and 16 unaffected carriers). Flow-FISH(flow cytometry sorting of cells whose telomeres are labeled by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) was used to measure mean telomere length of six white blood cell subtypes from 14 known VHL pathogenic variant carriers.
RESULTS: The median AOO for generations I, II and III were 32.5, 22.5 and 12.0 years, respectively. The differences in the AOO between generations were highly significant using a Cox proportional hazards model (P=6.00x10<sup>-12</sup>). Telomere lengths were significantly different for granulocytes and natural killer lymphocytes of patients with vHL compared with age-matched controls. For six vHL parent-child pairs, median white blood cell telomere lengths between parent and child were not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vHL telomere abnormalities may be primarily somatic in origin rather than a cause of GA. As tumour development exhibits GA in our cohort, vHL surveillance guidelines may need to account for a patient's generational position within a vHL pedigree.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations induce neural tissue hemangioblastomas, as well as highly vascularized clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Pathological vessel remodeling arises from misregulation of HIFs and VEGF, among other genes. Variation in disease penetrance has long been recognized in relation to genotype. We show Vhl mutations also disrupt Notch signaling, causing mutation-specific vascular abnormalities, e.g., type 1 (null) vs. type 2B (murine G518A representing human R167Q). In conditional mutation retina vasculature, Vhl-null mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/fl) had little effect on initial vessel branching, but it severely reduced arterial and venous branching at later stages. Interestingly, this mutation accelerated arterial maturation, as observed in retina vessel morphology and aberrant alpha-smooth muscle actin localization, particularly in vascular pericytes. RNA sequencing analysis identified gene expression changes within several key pathways, including Notch and smooth muscle cell contractility. Notch inhibition failed to reverse later-stage branching defects but rescued the accelerated arterialization. Retinal vessels harboring the type 2B Vhl mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/2B) displayed stage-specific changes in vessel branching and an advanced progression toward an arterial phenotype. Disrupting Notch signaling in type 2B mutants increased both artery and vein branching and restored arterial maturation toward nonmutant levels. By revealing differential effects of the null and type 2B Vhl mutations on vessel branching and maturation, these data may provide insight into the variability of VHL-associated vascular changes - particularly the heterogeneity and aggressiveness in ccRCC vessel growth - and also suggest Notch pathway targets for treating VHL syndrome.

AB  - We report the case of a 21-year old woman presenting with high blood pressure and raised normetanephrine levels. Indium-111-pentetreotide single photon-emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging showing isolated tracer-uptake by a 2 cm tumor close to the costovertebral angle of the third thoracic vertebra. Thoracic surgery led to normalization of normetanephrine levels. Histological findings were consistent with the presence of a paraganglioma. Mutations in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, RET, SDHAF2, TMEM127, MAX, NF1, FH, MDH2, and EPAS1 were absent, but a heterozygous missense mutation, c.311G > T, was found in exon 1 of the von Hippel-Lindau gene, VHL, resulting in a glycine to valine substitution in the VHL protein at position 104, p.Gly104Val. This same mutation was found in both the mother and the 17-year old sister in whom a small retinal hemangioblastoma was also found. We diagnose an unusual functional mediastinal paraganglioma in this young patient with a germline VHL gene mutation, a mutation previously described as inducing polycythemia and/or pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma or retinal hemangioblastoma.

CASE REPORT: A patient treated for sporadic cerebellar HB relapsed 12 years post-surgery. She developed disseminated disease throughout the CNS, including leptomeningeal manifestations. Repeat surgery and craniospinal radiation therapy were unsuccessful.
CONCLUSION: This case is in line with previous publications on disseminated non-VHL HB. Available treatment options are inefficient, emphasizing the need for improved understanding of HB biology to identify therapeutic targets.

AB  - Reduced choroidal blood flow and tissue changes in the ageing human eye impair oxygen delivery to photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium. As a consequence, mild but chronic hypoxia may develop and disturb cell metabolism, function and ultimately survival, potentially contributing to retinal pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, we show that several hypoxia-inducible genes were expressed at higher levels in the aged human retina suggesting increased activity of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) during the physiological ageing process. To model chronically elevated HIF activity and investigate ensuing consequences for photoreceptors, we generated mice lacking von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein in rods. This activated HIF transcription factors and led to a slowly progressing retinal degeneration in the ageing mouse retina. Importantly, this process depended mainly on HIF1 with only a minor contribution of HIF2. A gene therapy approach using AAV-mediated RNA interference through an anti-Hif1a shRNA significantly mitigated the degeneration suggesting a potential intervention strategy that may be applicable to human patients.

AB  - The current World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of renal tumours is based on characteristic histological features or specific molecular alterations. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) alteration is the hallmark of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). After identification of the MiT translocation family of tumours, clear cell papillary renal cancer and others, the group of ccRCC with wild-type VHL is small. TCEB1 mutation combined with chromosome 8q loss is an emerging tumour entity with wild-type VHL. Inactivation of TCEB1 increases HIF stabilisation via the same mechanism as VHL inactivation. Importantly, recent molecular analyses suggest the existence of another 'VHL wild-type' evolutionary subtype of clear cell RCC in addition to TCEB1 mutated RCC and clear cell papillary renal cancer. These tumours are characterised by an aggressive behaviour, high tumour cell proliferation rate, elevated chromosomal instability and frequent presence of sarcomatoid differentiation. Future clinicopathological studies will have to provide data to determine whether TCEB1 tumours and clear cell RCC with wild-type VHL are separate tumour entities or represent variants of a clear cell RCC tumour family.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to determine the frequency of von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) as the underlying cause of retinal hemangioblastoma and to estimate retinal hemangioblastoma incidence and prevalence in a national cohort study.
METHODS: Through the national patient register and vHL research database, we identified 81 patients diagnosed with a retinal hemangioblastoma in Denmark between 1977 and 2014. Consent was obtained for 54 living and 10 deceased patients with retinal hemangioblastoma. For each participant, we collected medical records and family information. Almost all (63 of 64) participants were or had previously been tested for mutations in the VHL gene.
RESULTS: Overall, 84% of the participants (54 of the 64) had vHL. Compared with the non-vHL patients, the vHL patients had their first retinal hemangioblastoma at a younger age (22.5 vs 40 years), and were more likely to have an asymptomatic first hemangioblastoma (80% vs 20%). Overall, 76% (41 of 54) of the vHL patients had a family history of vHL, while none of the patients without vHL did. Despite the rarity of the disease, on average more than eight new tumours are diagnosed each year due to multiple tumour development in vHL patients. The estimated prevalence of patients with retinal hemangioblastoma was up to 1 in 73 080 individuals.
CONCLUSION: In the first national study in which almost all participants were genetically tested, vHL was the underlying cause of retinal hemangioblastoma in 84% of cases; more often than previously reported. We recommend that genetic and clinical vHL screening should be performed in all patients with retinal hemangioblastoma.

AB  - Autophagy is a highly conserved, homeostatic process by which cytosolic components reach lysosomes for degradation. The roles played by different autophagic processes in cancer are complex and remain cancer type and stage dependent. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common subtype of kidney cancer and is characterized by the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. Our previous study identified a small compound, STF-62247, as an autophagy-modulating molecule causing selective cytotoxicity for VHL-inactivated cells. This present study investigates the effects of STF-62247 specifically on the macroautophagic flux to better characterize its mechanism of action in RCC. Our results clearly demonstrate that this compound is a potent blocker of late stages of autophagy. We show that inhibiting autophagy by CRISPR knockouts of autophagy-related genes rendered VHL-deficient cells insensitive to STF-62247, uncovering the importance of the autophagic pathway in STF-selective cell death. By exploiting the autofluorescence of STF-62247, we pinpointed its cellular localization to lysosomes. Finally, in response to prolonged STF treatments, we show that VHL-proficient cells are able to surmount the block in late stages of autophagy by restoring their lysosome numbers. Conversely, an increase in autophagic vesicles accompanied by a time-dependent decrease in lysosomes was observed in VHL-deficient cells. This is the first mechanistic study investigating STF-62447's effects on the autophagic flux in RCC. Importantly, our study reclassifies STF-62247 as a blocker of later stages of autophagy and highlights the possibility of blocking this process through lysosome disruption in VHL-mutated RCCs.

AB  - Dysregulated mitochondrial function is associated with the pathology of a wide range of diseases including renal disease and cancer. Thus, investigating regulators of mitochondrial function is of particular interest. Previous work has shown that the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory chain function. pVHL is best known as an E3-ubiquitin ligase for the alpha-subunit of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family of dimeric transcription factors. In normoxia, pVHL recognizes and binds hydroxylated HIF-alpha (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In this way, HIF transcriptional activity is tightly controlled at the level of HIF-alpha protein stability. At least 80% of clear cell renal carcinomas exhibit inactivation of the VHL gene, which leads to HIF-alpha protein stabilization and constitutive HIF activation. Constitutive HIF activation in renal carcinoma drives tumor progression and metastasis. Reconstitution of wild-type VHL protein (pVHL) in pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells not only suppresses HIF activation and tumor growth, but also enhances mitochondrial respiratory chain function via mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that pVHL regulates mitochondrial function when re-expressed in pVHL-defective 786O and RCC10 renal carcinoma cells distinct from its regulation of HIF-alpha. Expression of CHCHD4, a key component of the disulphide relay system (DRS) involved in mitochondrial protein import within the intermembrane space (IMS) was elevated by pVHL re-expression alongside enhanced expression of respiratory chain subunits of complex I (NDUFB10) and complex IV (mtCO-2 and COX IV). These changes correlated with increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and dynamic changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism. Knockdown of HIF-2alpha also led to increased OCR, and elevated expression of CHCHD4, NDUFB10, and COXIV in 786O cells. Expression of pVHL mutant proteins (R200W, N78S, D126N, and S183L) that constitutively stabilize HIF-alpha but differentially promote glycolytic metabolism, were also found to differentially promote the pVHL-mediated mitochondrial phenotype. Parallel changes in mitochondrial morphology and the mitochondrial network were observed. Our study reveals a new role for pVHL in regulating CHCHD4 and mitochondrial function in renal carcinoma cells.

Results: 29/30 patients harboured CRC (20 harboured CCC, 29 CRC-UMF) and 25/29 patients carried VHL mutations in their tumour. 205 single CRC (64 CCC, 141 CRC-UMF) provided genetic data. 57/57 CCC and 104/125 CRC-UMF from the 25 patients with VHL-mutated tumor carried the same VHL mutation detected in the tumor. Seven CCC and 16 CRC-UMF did not carry VHL mutations but were found in patients with wild-type VHL tumor tissue.
Conclusions: All the CCC and 83,2% (104/125) of the CRC-UMF were found to carry the same VHL mutation identified in the corresponding tumorous tissue, validating cytopathological identification of CCC in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
Methods: The blood of 30 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma was treated by ISET<sup></sup> for CRC isolation, cytopathology and single-cell VHL mutations analysis, performed blindly and compared to VHL mutations of corresponding tumor tissues and leukocytes.

AB  - Numerous studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, are determining regulatory elements involved in the pathogenesis of various types of cancer, including cervical cancer (CC). Although miR-21-5p upregulation has been demonstrated to associate with tumorigenesis by controlling the expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes, only a small number of studies have investigated the expression of miR-21-5p and its functional role in CC. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of miR-21-5p on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of CC cells, and the potential underlying molecular mechanism of these effects. The measurement of miR-21-5p levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that miR-21-5p was markedly increased in CC cell lines compared with normal cells. Upon silencing of miR-21-5p, a marked suppression of the proliferation, migration and invasion of CaSki cells was observed, with induction of cell apoptosis. These effects were reversed with miR-21-5p overexpression. A database search followed by a luciferase reporter assay ascertained that the 3'-untranslated region of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mRNA sequence was a direct target of miR-21-5p. Furthermore, silencing of VHL neutralized the effects of miR-21-5p inhibition. These observations suggested that miR-21-5p is an oncogene that is able to promote the metastatic phenotype of CC cells through downregulation of VHL expression, which may present a path to novel therapeutic stratagems for the CC therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and particularly its clear cell histological subtype, is commonly characterized by genetic alterations in the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, leading to a typically exasperated angiogenesis. However, other biological and genetic peculiarities contribute to differentiate this malignancy from other solid tumors, including its immunogenicity. Areas covered: This review focuses on the present and future role of antiangiogenic drugs, administered either alone (as it has been in the past few years), or in combination with other agents (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors), in the treatment of metastatic RCC. Expert commentary: Due to its peculiar pathogenesis, it is unrealistic to expect to be able to get rid of antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of this disease; however, we do expect that combinations of VEGF/VEGFRs-targeting agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors will gradually replace antiangiogenic monotherapies as the standard of care, at least in the first line setting of metastatic RCC patients. Biomarkers discovery remains the highest priority in order to further improve the percentage of patients benefitting of our treatment.

AB  - To understand the mechanism of cellular stress in basal-parabasal layers of normal cervical epithelium and during different stages of cervical carcinoma, we analyzed the alterations (expression/methylation/copy number variation/mutation) of HIF-1alpha and its associated genes LIMD1, VHL and VEGF in disease-free normal cervix (n = 9), adjacent normal cervix of tumors (n = 70), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN; n = 32), cancer of uterine cervix (CACX; n = 174) samples and two CACX cell lines. In basal-parabasal layers of normal cervical epithelium, LIMD1 showed high protein expression, while low protein expression of VHL was concordant with high expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF irrespective of HPV-16 (human papillomavirus 16) infection. This was in concordance with the low promoter methylation of LIMD1 and high in VHL in the basal-parabasal layers of normal cervix. LIMD1 expression was significantly reduced while VHL expression was unchanged during different stages of cervical carcinoma. This was in concordance with their frequent methylation during different stages of this tumor. In different stages of cervical carcinoma, the expression pattern of HIF-1alpha and VEGF was high as seen in basal-parabasal layers and inversely correlated with the expression of LIMD1 and VHL. This was validated by demethylation experiments using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in CACX cell lines. Additional deletion of LIMD1 and VHL in CIN/CACX provided an additional growth advantage during cervical carcinogenesis through reduced expression of genes and associated with poor prognosis of patients. Our data showed that overexpression of HIF-1alpha and its target gene VEGF in the basal-parabasal layers of normal cervix was due to frequent inactivation of VHL by its promoter methylation. This profile was maintained during different stages of cervical carcinoma with additional methylation/deletion of VHL and LIMD1.

AB  - The field of hereditary kidney cancer has begun to mature following the identification of several germline syndromes that define genetic and molecular features of this cancer. Molecular defects within these hereditary syndromes demonstrate consistent deficits in angiogenesis and metabolic signaling, largely driven by altered hypoxia signaling. The classical mutation, loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, provides a human pathogenesis model for critical aspects of pseudohypoxia. These features are mimicked in a less common hereditary renal tumor syndrome, known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma. Here, we review renal tumor angiogenesis and metabolism from a HIF-centric perspective, considering alterations in the hypoxic landscape, and molecular deviations resulting from high levels of HIF family members. Mutations underlying HIF deregulation drive multifactorial aberrations in angiogenic signals and metabolism. The mechanisms by which these defects drive tumor growth are still emerging. However, the distinctive patterns of angiogenesis and glycolysis-/glutamine-dependent bioenergetics provide insight into the cellular environment of these cancers. The result is a scenario permissive for aggressive tumorigenesis especially within the proximal renal tubule. These features of tumorigenesis have been highly actionable in kidney cancer treatments, and will likely continue as central tenets of kidney cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Both Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) and Never-in-mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinase 1 (NEK1) are involved in primary cilium formation, but whether VHL could regulate NEK1 is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that renal cancer cells Caki-1 and ACHN with wild-type VHL expressed lower level of NEK1 than that of VHL-defective cells including 786-O, 769-P and A498cells. VHL-overexpression down-regulated NEK1 in 769-P cells, while VHL-knockdown up-regulated NEK1 in Caki-1cells. In addition, we found the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the promoter sequence of NEK1 and hypoxia induced NEK1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. HIF-2alpha knockdown blocked hypoxia induced NEK1 upregulation instead of HIF-1alpha, which indicates that NEK1 may be a new target of HIF-2alpha. Moreover, we confirmed the association between VHL and NEK1 in Caki-1cell, then showed VHL promoted NEK1 protein degradation and ubiquitination. In conclusion, our findings showed VHL regulates NEK1 via both HIF-2alpha pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in renal cancer cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is rare neurocutaneous disorder arising from an inactivating mutation of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p35. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and predominantly involves tissues originating from the ectodermal germ layer. Although hemangioblastomas of retina and cerebellum are the most common clinical features, multiple-organ involvement in the form of renal cell carcinomas, spinal hemangioblastomas, renal cysts, pancreatic cysts have also been reported. Hemangioblastomas of the spinal canal could present as cauda equina syndrome.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 55-year-old man with cauda equina syndrome as his first manifestion. An initial magnetic resonance imaging scan uncovered hemangiomas in the spinal canal. A thorough family history strongly suggested an autosomal dominant pattern of disease inheritance. Further physical examination and imaging revealed additional organ involvement consistent with VHL. We performed laminectomy and partial resection of hemangioblastoma for decompression. He recovered satisfactorily with his cauda equina syndrome resolving quickly post operation. No deterioration was apparent by 12 months follow-up visit.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with cauda equina syndrome as the first manifestation of VHL disease. Laminectomy and partial resection of hemangioblastoma is a safe and effective treatment to resolve impingement of the spinal cord. VHL disease resulting in hemangioblastoma in the spinal canal is rarely seen but should be included in the differential diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome to facilitate genetic counseling for the proband and offspring.

AB  - Loss of the gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is associated with loss of primary cilia and is causally linked to elevated levels of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We developed an image-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using a dual-labeling image analysis strategy that identifies both the cilium and the basal body. By using this strategy, we screened small-molecule compounds for the targeted rescue of cilia defects associated with VHL deficiency with high accuracy and reproducibility. Bexarotene was identified and validated as a positive regulator of the primary cilium. Importantly, the inability of an alternative retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist to rescue ciliogenesis, in contrast to bexarotene, suggested that multiple bexarotene-driven mechanisms were responsible for the rescue. We found that bexarotene decreased AURKA expression in VHL-deficient cells, thereby restoring the ability of these cells to ciliate in the absence of VHL Finally, bexarotene treatment reduced the propensity of subcutaneous lesions to develop into tumors in a mouse xenograft model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with a concomitant decrease in activated AURKA, highlighting the potential of bexarotene treatment as an intervention strategy in the clinic to manage renal cystogenesis associated with VHL deficiency and elevated AURKA expression.

AB  - Pheochromocytoma, a rare catecholamine producing neuroendocrine tumour (sometimes biochemically silent), a must exclude cause of secondary hypertension due to adverse fatal cardiovascular outcomes, was endorsed for genetic testing in all proven cases of PPGL at joint meeting of the International Congress of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society in 2014. At least 9 pathogenic mutations implied - RET, VHL, NF 1, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2 or SDH5 and TMEM127. Result(s): Our case series of 16 patients of PPGL, found mean age 35.5 yrs (range 2.5-70 yrs), gender M:F ratio 3:2, familial-6.3% (1 medullary thyroid cancer), no hypertension-31.3%, lack of classic spells -62.5%, lack of syndromic features-93.8% (1 von Hippel Lindau disease), noradrenergic -92.8% (VHL heterozygous mutants), adrenergic-6.3% (single RET mutant), metastasis to liver, pleura, bone -14.3% (VHL mutant, SDH-negative), mean tumor size-6.6 cm (largest-12.8 cm), mean 24 hours urine normetanephrine-4055 mcg (maximum- 7996 mcg, 6.7 fold upper normal limit). Genetic test VHL positive-68.8% (11 of 16), RET -6.3%(1). No SDH mutation, extra-adrenal location was found. Conclusion(s): Our case series highlights single VHL gene directed genetic screen may suffice in all noradrenergic bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma, in any age, without syndromic/familial clues, even in presence of metastasis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Every year more than 800 patients in Denmark are diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of which 3-5% are expected to be part of a hereditary renal cancer syndrome. We performed genetic screening of causative and putative RCC-genes (VHL, FH, FLCN, MET, SDHB, BAP1, MITF, CDKN2B) in RCC-patients suspected of a genetic predisposition.
METHODS: The cohort consisted of forty-eight Danish families or individuals with early onset RCC, a family history of RCC, a family history of RCC and melanoma or both RCC- and melanoma diagnosis in the same individual. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples or cancer-free formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.
RESULTS: One start codon variant of unknown clinical significance (VUS) (c.3G>A, p.Met1Ile) and one missense VUS (c.631A>C, p.Met211Leu) was found in VHL in a patient with RCC-onset at twenty-eight years of age but without other manifestations or family history of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL). Furthermore, in three families we found three different variants in BAP1, one of which was a novel non-segregating missense variant (c.1502G>A, p.Ser501Asn) in a family with two brothers affected with RCC. Finally, we found the known E318K-substitution in MITF in a RCC-affected member of a family with multiple melanomas. No variants were detected in CDKN2B.
CONCLUSION: Although we did find three VUS's in BAP1 in three families and a pathogenic variant in MITF in one family, pathogenic germline variants in BAP1, MITF or CDKN2B are not frequent causes of hereditary renal cancer in Denmark. It is possible that the high prevalence of risk factors such as male gender, smoking and obesity has influenced the development of cancer in the patients of the current study. Further investigations into putative predisposing genes and risk factors of RCC are necessary to enable better prediction of renal cancer risk or presymptomatic testing of relatives in hereditary renal cancer families.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a monogenic disorder characterized by the development of tumors affecting the central nervous system, kidney, pancreas, or adrenal glands, and due to germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. About 5% of patients with a typical VHL phenotype have no mutation detected by conventional techniques, so a postzygotic VHL mosaicism can be suspected. The aim of this study was therefore to implement a next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategy for VHL mosaic mutation detection, including an optimization of the original Personal Genome Machine design by enrichment with oligonucleotides corresponding to amplicons with insufficient depth of coverage. Two complementary strategies were developed for the confirmation of mosaic mutations identified by NGS, SNaPshot for variants present at an allelic ratio greater than 5%, and droplet digital PCR for allelic ratio above 1%. VHL mutant plasmids were generated to assess VHL mosaic mutation detection in different exons and to set up an internal quality control that could be included in each run or regularly to validate the assay. This strategy was applied to 47 patients with a suggestive or clinical VHL disease, and mosaic mutations were identified in 8.5% of patients. In conclusion, NGS technologies combined with SNaPshot or droplet digital PCR allow the detection and confirmation of mosaic mutations in a clinical laboratory setting.

AB  - Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that recruit an E3 ligase to a target protein to facilitate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of that protein. While the field of targeted degraders is still relatively young, the potential for this modality to become a differentiated and therapeutic reality is strong, such that both academic and pharmaceutical institutions are now entering this interesting area of research. In this article, we describe a broadly applicable process for identifying degrader hits based on the serine/threonine kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and have generalized the key structural elements associated with degradation activities. Compound 3i is a potent hit (TBK1 DC<sub>50</sub> = 12 nM, D<sub>max</sub> = 96%) with excellent selectivity against a related kinase IKKepsilon, which was further used as a chemical tool to assess TBK1 as a target in mutant K-Ras cancer cells.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a commonly diagnosed and histologically diverse urologic malignancy. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is by far the most common, followed by the papillary and chromophobe subtypes. Sarcomatoid differentiation is a morphologic change that can be seen in all subtypes that typically portends a poor prognosis. In the past, treatment options for RCC were limited to cytokine-based therapy with a high-toxicity profile and low response rate. An increased understanding of the molecular basis of RCC has led to substantial improvement in treatment options in the form of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. A significant early discovery in RCC was frequent inactivation of the Von Hippel Lindau gene in ccRCC, which ultimately led to the development of vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Further genomic sequencing of ccRCC tumors has identified other common mutations including BAP-1, PBRM1, SETD2, and PIK3CA. Many recent studies have explored how these mutations can affect prognosis and response to treatment. Likewise, papillary RCC has also been studied at the molecular level, which has shown a high level of mutations in the MET gene; early clinical data suggest the utility of MET targeted therapy. Finally, regarding the rarer sarcomatoid tumors, mutations in TP53 and NF2 may be important to their development. As we continue to learn more about what drives RCC at the molecular level, treatment options for RCC patients are diversifying.

AB  - Cancer-specific metabolic alterations are of high interest as therapeutic targets. These alterations vary between tumor types, and to employ metabolic targeting to its fullest potential there is a need for robust methods that identify candidate targetable metabolic pathways in individual cancers. Currently, such methods include 13C-tracing studies and mass spectrometry/ magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Due to high cost and complexity, such studies are restricted to a research setting. We here present the validation of a novel technique of metabolic profiling, based on multiplex targeted next generation sequencing of RNA with single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), designed to measure activity of and mutations in genes that encode metabolic enzymes. We here profiled an isogenic pair of cell lines, differing in expression of the Von Hippel Lindau protein, an important regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes. We show that smMIP-profiling provides relevant information on active metabolic pathways. Because smMIP-based targeted RNAseq is cost-effective and can be applied in a medium high-throughput setting (200 samples can be profiled simultaneously in one next generation sequencing run) it is a highly interesting approach for profiling of the activity of genes of interest, including those regulating metabolism, in a routine patient care setting.

AB  - The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome has been rarely associated with renal oncocytomas, and tumors usually show HIF1alpha chronic stabilization. By contrast, oncocytomas mainly associated with respiratory chain (RC) defects due to severe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are incapable of stabilizing HIF1alpha, since oxygen consumption by the RC is dramatically diminished and prolylhydroxylase activity is increased by alpha-ketoglutarate accumulation following Krebs cycle slowdown. Here, we investigate the cooccurrence of a pseudohypoxic condition with oncocytic transformation in a case of VHL-associated renal oncocytoma. While HIF1alpha was abundant in nuclei concordantly with defects in VHL, negative staining of its targets carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and glucose transporter GLUT1, usually overexpressed in VHL-associated neoplasms, suggested HIF1alpha to be present in its inactive (hydroxylated) form. MtDNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry analyses revealed a MT-CO1 stop-gain mutation and cytochrome c oxidase loss. We suggest that a mitochondrial respiration impairment may lead to hyperhydroxylation of the transcription factor, which we confirmed by specific staining of hydroxylated HIF1alpha. Such inactive form hence accumulated in the VHL-deficient tumor, where it may contribute to the benign nature of the neoplasm. We propose that the protumorigenic role of HIF1alpha in VHL cancers may be blunted through drugs inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory complexes, such as metformin.

AB  - Previous research has revealed that the von-Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) may downregulate never-in-mitosis A-related kinase 8 (NEK8) via hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha). The HIF-independent functions of pVHL also serve an important role in its tumor-suppressor action. In the present study, the association between pVHL and NEK8 was demonstrated in the human gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901, indicating a direct interaction of pVHL with NEK8. Subsequently, it was reported that MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, may attenuate pVHL overexpression-induced reductions in NEK8 protein expression levels. In addition, the present study revealed that pVHL may stimulate the rapid degradation of NEK8 protein and promote its ubiquitination. The association between the expression profile of NEK8 and the survival status of patients with gastric cancer was analyzed from an online database. Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicated that higher expression levels of NEK8 may lead to poor survival, as suggested by the transcriptomic data of 1,065 patients with gastric cancer. It was found that NEK8-knockdown mediated by RNA interference inhibited SGC-7901 and SNU-1 proliferation, colony formation and migration in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, the present study proposed that NEK8 may be a novel target of pVHL as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and may serve a role as a potential oncoprotein in human gastric cancer.

AB  - The skeleton has emerged as an important regulator of systemic glucose homeostasis, with osteocalcin and insulin representing prime mediators of the interplay between bone and energy metabolism. However, genetic evidence indicates that osteoblasts can influence global energy metabolism through additional, as yet unknown, mechanisms. Here, we report that constitutive or postnatally induced deletion of the hypoxia signaling pathway component von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) in skeletal osteolineage cells of mice led to high bone mass as well as hypoglycemia and increased glucose tolerance, not accounted for by osteocalcin or insulin. In vitro and in vivo data indicated that Vhl-deficient osteoblasts displayed massively increased glucose uptake and glycolysis associated with upregulated HIF-target gene expression, resembling the Warburg effect that typifies cancer cells. Overall, the glucose consumption by the skeleton was increased in the mutant mice, as revealed by 18F-FDG radioactive tracer experiments. Moreover, the glycemia levels correlated inversely with the level of skeletal glucose uptake, and pharmacological treatment with the glycolysis inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA), which restored glucose metabolism in Vhl-deficient osteogenic cells in vitro, prevented the development of the systemic metabolic phenotype in the mutant mice. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel link between cellular glucose metabolism in osteoblasts and whole-body glucose homeostasis, controlled by local hypoxia signaling in the skeleton.

AB  - Importance: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated central nervous system (CNS) lesions include hemangioblastomas and endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs), which are associated with significant neurological morbidity and mortality. Recent studies provide critical new biological, diagnostic, and management insights into these tumors.
Observations: Biological features, natural history, clinical findings, and management strategies of VHL disease-associated CNS tumors are reviewed. The VHL disease results from a germline mutation of the VHL gene (located on the short arm of chromosome 3), a tumor suppressor that encodes for the VHL protein. Whereas VHL disease is associated with visceral manifestations, CNS lesions are the most common source of morbidity and mortality. Craniospinal hemangioblastomas are almost entirely (99%) found in the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. These tumors arise from multipotent hemangioblasts. Peritumoral cysts frequently underlie the clinical findings associated with hemangioblastomas (>90% of symptomatic tumors). Prospective natural history studies demonstrate that CNS hemangioblastomas typically grow in a saltatory pattern. Due to this unpredictable growth pattern, surgical resection is reserved for symptomatic lesions, as many tumors do not become symptomatic. Recent studies indicate that VHL disease-associated ELSTs cause audiovestibular morbidity (hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo) via 3 mechanisms-otic capsule invasion, intralabyrinthine hemorrhage, and endolymphatic hydrops. Specialized magnetic resonance imaging techniques have been defined to elucidate each of these mechanisms, even when a tumor mass is not identified on imaging. Endolymphatic sac tumors cause audiovestibular morbidity unrelated to size or progression, and resection is now recommended at initial discovery of a tumor mass or a tumor-associated mechanism of morbidity.
Conclusions and Relevance: New insights into the development, pathobiological origin, natural history, and long-term outcomes of VHL disease-associated CNS tumors have redefined their management and treatment indications and potentially provide new targeted therapeutic strategies. Resection is reserved for symptomatic hemangioblastomas, but early resection of newly detected ELSTs is now recommended.

AB  - Hemangioblastomas are rare vascularized central nervous system tumors, which can occur sporadically or be associated with von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. The pathogenesis of hemangioblastomas in von Hippel Lindau Syndrome is proposed to involve a pseudohypoxic intracellular state induced by dysregulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha due to the absence of von Hippel Lindau protein complex mediated destruction. Dysregulation of fumarate hydratase, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, occurs in Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome due to germline fumarate hydratase gene mutations, and also results in oncogenesis via hypoxia inducible factor alpha dysregulation. We present a case study of hemangioblastoma occurrence in a Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome patient and propose it as possible evidence of a phenotypic overlap between von Hippel Lindau and Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndromes due to their overlapping role in the biochemical regulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha.

AB  - Hemangioblastomas are rare vascularized central nervous system tumors, which can occur sporadically or be associated with von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. The pathogenesis of hemangioblastomas in von Hippel Lindau Syndrome is proposed to involve a pseudohypoxic intracellular state induced by dysregulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha due to the absence of von Hippel Lindau protein complex mediated destruction. Dysregulation of fumarate hydratase, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, occurs in Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome due to germline fumarate hydratase gene mutations, and also results in oncogenesis via hypoxia inducible factor alpha dysregulation. We present a case study of hemangioblastoma occurrence in a Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome patient and propose it as possible evidence of a phenotypic overlap between von Hippel Lindau and Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndromes due to their overlapping role in the biochemical regulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha.

AB  - Introduction Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is characterized by mutation or inactivation of Von Hippel-Lindau suppressor gene. The mutation of Von Hippel-Lindau mechanism is associated with the upregulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor protein, inducing the overexpression of proteins including erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors are widely used in treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In paradoxical hematological effect with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, hemoglobin level may be increased, but polycythemia requiring phlebotomy is very rare. Case description We present here a case of renal cell carcinoma who received successive treatment with sunitinib, everolimus, and axitinib. While he had a normal hemoglobin level with prior sunitinib treatment, on the sixth week of axitinib treatment, he developed polycythemia and treatment response was seen after axitinib-associated polycythemia.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the type of VHL gene pathogenic variant influences the growth rate or CT enhancement values of renal lesions in VHL patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two VHL patients (19 male) were selected from a prospectively maintained imaging database for patients that underwent surgical tumor resection between 2014 and 2016. One hundred and eleven VHL lesions were marked for resection and pathology analysis. Whole lesion volumetric segmentation was performed on nephrographic phase of the two most recent contrast-enhanced CT scans before surgery. Intensity distribution curves were obtained from segmentations. A linear mixed model, accounting for within-patient correlations, was used to compare the growth and enhancement differences between different germline pathogenic variant types.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference for the lesions' total growth between different germline pathogenic variants (P value = 0.78). The median growth rate for all lesions was 1.7 cc/year (IQR 0.5, 3.9) with a baseline median size of 4.1 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 1.7, 11.7). In complex lesions, the solid portion of the tumor demonstrated a higher growth rate (1.6 cc/year) than cystic portions (0.02 cc/year) which stayed relatively unchanged. Only one pathogenic variant (Splice donor) showed some levels of difference in its relative enhancement from other subtypes.
CONCLUSION: The type of germline pathogenic variant on the VHL gene does not affect the growth rate or CT enhancement values of renal lesions in patients with VHL. The absolute growth rate of these tumors may be used in the scheduling of follow-up studies.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms at the posttranscriptional level. More than half of miRNA genes have been recognized to be located in different fragile sites. Among them, miR-510 was located on chromosome X in the 27.3Xq region, flanking to a fragile X site. The CGG expansion and its methylation at the promoter of FMR1 located in this fragile site were associated with clinical symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS). The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the miR-510 expression was correlated with the CGG expansion of FMR1 in female carriers of full mutation. For this purpose, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from peripheral blood of FMR1 full mutation female carriers. After differentiation of these cells into neuronal cells, the expression of miR-510 was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the target genes of miR-510 in the nervous system were also predicted by in silico method. The obtained results indicated that the CGG expansion of FMR1 was associated with the enhanced expression of miR-510. Furthermore, the bioinformatics analysis suggested that VHL and PPP2R5E genes could be considered as the most important target genes of miR-510 in the nervous system. This study showed that miR-510 and its target genes, specifically VHL and PPP2R5E, may represent the new targets for future therapy options of FXS. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Ectopic epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in facilitating tumorigenesis. Here, we first demonstrated that ANKDD1A is a functional tumor suppressor gene, especially in the hypoxia microenvironment. ANKDD1A directly interacts with FIH1 and inhibits the transcriptional activity of HIF1alpha by upregulating FIH1. In addition, ANKDD1A decreases the half-life of HIF1alpha by upregulating FIH1, decreases glucose uptake and lactate production, inhibits glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) autophagy, and induces apoptosis in GBM cells under hypoxia. Moreover, ANKDD1A is highly frequently methylated in GBM. The tumor-specific methylation of ANKDD1A indicates that it could be used as a potential epigenetic biomarker as well as a possible therapeutic target.

AB  - CONTEXT: von Hippel-Lindau disease, comprising renal cancer, hemangioblastoma and/or pheochromocytoma (PHEO) is caused by missense or truncating variants of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, which is involved in degradation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). However, the role of synonymous VHL variants in the disease is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated a synonymous VHL variant in patients with familial PHEO or VHL disease without a detectable pathogenic VHL mutation.
DESIGN: We performed genetic and transcriptional analyses of leukocytes and/or tumors from affected and unaffected individuals and evaluated VHL splicing in existing cancer databases.
RESULTS: We identified a synonymous VHL variant(c.414A>G, p.Pro138Pro) as the driver event in five independent individuals/families with PHEOs or VHL syndrome. This variant promotes exon 2 skipping and, hence, abolishes expression of the full-length VHL transcript. Exon 2 spans the HIF binding domain, required for HIF degradation by VHL. Accordingly, PHEOs carrying this variant display HIF hyperactivation typical of VHL loss. Moreover, other exon 2 VHL variants from the TCGA pan-cancer datasets are biased toward expression of a VHL transcript that excludes this exon, supporting a broader impact of this spliced variant.
CONCLUSION: A recurrent synonymous VHL variant (c.414A>G, p.Pro138Pro) confers susceptibility to PHEO and VHL disease through splice disruption, leading to VHL dysfunction. This finding indicates that certain synonymous VHL variants may be clinically relevant and should be considered in genetic testing and surveillance settings. The observation that other coding VHL variants can exclude exon 2 suggests that dysregulated splicing may be an underappreciated mechanism in VHL-mediated tumorigenesis.

AB  - Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are critical regulators of the response to oxygen deficiency by activating target genes involved in a variety of biological functions. HIFs have been implicated in the pathophysiology of numerous pathologies including cancer. Patients with mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, an essential regulator of HIF activity, develop tumors in several organs including the pancreas. Previous functional studies of HIF activation in the pancreas have used Vhlh (the murine homolog of VHL) deficient mice. However, the role of each specific HIF transcription factors in the pancreas has not been thoroughly examined. We derived mice that constitutively express a normoxia-stable form of HIF2alpha in the pancreas. Activation of HIF2alpha in the pancreas severely impairs postnatal exocrine pancreas. Mice with pancreas-specific activation of HIF2alpha develop histological features reminiscent of pancreatitis including loss of acinar cells, ductal dilation and fibrosis. Moreover, we provide evidence that signaling pathways important for acinar cell homeostasis are altered in HIF2alpha-overexpressing pancreata.

AB  - <b>Background:</b> Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors are well known to control the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Given the importance of cellular response to hypoxia, a number of pharmacological agents to interfere with this pathway have been developed and entered pre-clinical or clinical trial phases. However, how similar or divergent the transcriptional response elicited by different points of interference in cells is currently unknown. <b>Methods:</b> We performed RNA-sequencing to analyse the similarities and differences of transcriptional response in HeLa cells treated with hypoxia or chemical agents that stabilise HIF by inhibiting components of the hypoxia signalling pathway - prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor or von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) inhibitor. <b>Results:</b> This analysis revealed that hypoxia produces the highest changes in gene transcription, with activation and repression of genes being in large numbers. Treatment with the PHD inhibitor IOX2 or the VHL inhibitor VH032 led mostly to gene activation, majorly via a HIF-dependent manner. These results were also confirmed by qRT-PCR using more specific and/or efficient inhibitors, FG-4592 (PHDs) and VH298 (VHL). <b>Conclusion:</b> PHD inhibition and VHL inhibition mimic gene activation promoted by hypoxia via a HIF-dependent manner. However, gene repression is mostly associated with the hypoxia response and not common to the response elicited by inhibitors of the pathway.

AB  - RATIONALE: Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and its major product inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) regulate a variety of cellular functions, but their role in vascular biology remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: We have investigated the role of IPMK in regulating angiogenesis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Deletion of IPMK in fibroblasts induces angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models. IPMK deletion elicits a substantial increase of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which mediates the regulation of angiogenesis by IPMK. The regulation of VEGF by IPMK requires its catalytic activity. IPMK is predominantly nuclear and regulates gene transcription. However, IPMK does not apparently serve as a transcription factor for VEGF. HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-1alpha is a major determinant of angiogenesis and induces VEGF transcription. IPMK deletion elicits a major enrichment of HIF-1alpha protein and thus VEGF. HIF-1alpha is constitutively ubiquitinated by pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein) followed by proteasomal degradation under normal conditions. However, HIF-1alpha is not recognized and ubiquitinated by pVHL in IPMK KO (knockout) cells. IP5 reinstates the interaction of HIF-1alpha and pVHL. HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation, which is prerequisite for pVHL recognition, is interrupted in IPMK-deleted cells. IP5 promotes HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha. Deletion of IPMK in mouse brain increases HIF-1alpha/VEGF levels and vascularization. The increased VEGF in IPMK KO disrupts blood-brain barrier and enhances brain blood vessel permeability.
CONCLUSIONS: IPMK, via its product IP5, negatively regulates angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF expression. IP5 acts by enhancing HIF-1alpha hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha.

AB  - In the last two decades, the discovery of various pathways involved in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has led to the development of biologically-driven targeted therapies. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), angiogenic growth factors, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations, and oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in the pathogenesis and drug resistance of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. These insights have led to the development of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and immunotherapeutic agents, which have significantly improved the outcomes of patients with advanced RCC. HIF inhibitors will be a valuable asset in the growing therapeutic armamentarium of RCC. Various histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, selenium, and agents like PT2385 and PT2977 are being explored in various clinical trials as potential HIF inhibitors, to ameliorate the outcomes of RCC patients. In this article, we will review the current treatment options and highlight the potential role of selenium in the modulation of drug resistance biomarkers expressed in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) tumors.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome that is the main cause of inherited clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which generally occurs in the form of multiple recurrent synchronized tumors. Affected patients are carriers of a germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Somatic mutations of this gene are also found in sporadic ccRCC and numerous pan-genomic studies have reported a dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in these sporadic tumors. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of VHL-associated ccRCC, particularly in the context of multiple tumors, the present study characterized the mRNA and miRNA transcriptome through an integrative analysis compared with sporadic renal tumors. In the present study, two series of ccRCC samples were used. The first set consisted of several samples from different tumors occurring in the same patient, for two independent patients affected with VHL disease. The second set consisted of 12 VHL-associated tumors and 22 sporadic ccRCC tumors compared with a pool of normal renal tissue. For each sample series, an expression analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs was conducted using microarrays. The results indicated that multiple tumors within the kidney of a patient with VHL disease featured a similar pattern of miRNA and gene expression. In addition, the expression levels of miRNA were able to distinguish VHL-associated tumors from sporadic ccRCC, and it was identified that 103 miRNAs and 2,474 genes were differentially expressed in the ccRCC series compared with in normal renal tissue. The majority of dysregulated genes were implicated in 'immunity' and 'metabolism' pathways. Taken together, these results allow a better understanding of the occurrence of ccRCC in patients with VHL disease, by providing insights into dysregulated miRNA and mRNA. In the set of patients with VHL disease, there were few differences in miRNA and mRNA expression, thus indicating a similar molecular evolution of these synchronous tumors and suggesting that the same molecular mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis of these hereditary tumors.

AB  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and cereblon (CRBN) proteins are substrate recognition subunits of two ubiquitously expressed and biologically important Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. VHL and CRBN are also the two most popular E3 ligases being recruited by bifunctional Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to induce ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of a target protein. Using homo-PROTACs, VHL and CRBN have been independently dimerized to induce their own degradation. Here we report the design, synthesis and cellular activity of VHL-CRBN hetero-dimerizing PROTACs featuring diverse conjugation patterns. We found that the most active compound 14a induced potent, rapid and profound preferential degradation of CRBN over VHL in cancer cell lines. At lower concentrations, weaker degradation of VHL was instead observed. This work demonstrates proof of concept of designing PROTACs to hijack different E3 ligases against each other, and highlights a powerful and generalizable proximity-induced strategy to achieve E3 ligase knockdown.

AB  - Purpose: Across the globe, cervical cancer is the most common female malignancy, second only to breast cancer, as in both incidence and mortality. Currently, tissue biopsy is the gold standard to verify carcinoma of uterine cervix initial diagnosis and can be challenging due to its invasive nature. In this study, our objective was a noninvasive genetic panel for timely detection of cervical carcinoma and its progression using cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA). Method(s): Twenty-five cervical carcinoma patients were tested with a 50-gene tumor panel. ctDNA isolated from serum was checked for single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) or copy number alterations using targeted next-generation sequencing, with further validation of results by checking respective formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues for the same genetic alterations. Result(s): Out of 50 genes, 32 were detected in the serum samples. The SNVs detected included TP53 in 52.3% patients, CDKN2A in 47.6%, PTEN and STK11 in 33.3% patients, BRAF and VHL in 28.5% patients, EGFR and SMAD4 in 19% patients; CTNNB1, GNAS, KIT, APC, PIK3CA in 14.28% patients; SMARCB1, SMO, RET, FBXW7, ERBB2, CSF1R, CDH1, AKT1, ATM, EBB4, FGFR3, FLT3, HRAS, JAK3, MET, NOTCH1, NPM1, KRAS, PTPN11 in 4.7 to 9.5% patients. On combining alterations in BRAF, CDKN2A, EGFR, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, TP53 and VHL genes, at least one of the genetic alterations was found in 100% patients. Conclusion(s): These findings illustrate that ctDNA is easily demonstrable and can be used as a surrogate for tissue biopsy in uterine cervix carcinoma.

AB  - Increasing data implicate iron accumulation in tumorigenesis of the kidney, particularly the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) subtype. The von Hippel Lindau (VHL)/hypoxia inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) axis is uniquely dysregulated in ccRCC and is a major regulator and regulatory target of iron metabolism, yet the role of iron in ccRCC tumorigenesis and its potential interplay with VHL inactivation remains unclear. We investigated whether ccRCC iron accumulation occurs due to increased cell dependency on iron for growth and survival as a result of VHL inactivation. Free iron levels were compared between four VHL-mutant ccRCC cell lines (786-0, A704, 769-P, RCC4) and two benign renal tubule epithelial cell lines (RPTEC, HRCEp) using the Phen Green SK fluorescent iron stain. Intracellular iron deprivation was achieved using two clinical iron chelator drugs, deferasirox (DFX) and deferoxamine (DFO), and chelator effects were measured on cell line growth, cell cycle phase, apoptosis, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels and HIF-alpha transcriptional activity based on expression of target genes CA9, OCT4/POU5F1 and PDGFbeta/PDGFB. Similar assays were performed in VHL-mutant ccRCC cells with and without ectopic wild-type VHL expression. Baseline free iron levels were significantly higher in ccRCC cell lines than benign renal cell lines. DFX depleted cellular free iron more rapidly than DFO and led to greater growth suppression of ccRCC cell lines (>90% at ~30-150micro M) than benign renal cell lines (~10-50% at up to 250micro M). Similar growth responses were observed using DFO, with the exception that a prolonged treatment duration was necessary to deplete cellular iron adequately for differential growth suppression of the less susceptible A704 ccRCC cell line relative to benign renal cell lines. Apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest were identified as potential mechanisms of chelator growth suppression based on their induction in ccRCC cell lines but not benign renal cell lines. Iron chelation in ccRCC cells but not benign renal cells suppressed HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels and transcriptional activity, and the degree and timing of HIF-2alpha suppression correlated with the onset of apoptosis. Restoration of wild-type VHL function in ccRCC cells was sufficient to prevent chelator-induced apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest, indicating that ccRCC susceptibility to iron deprivation is VHL inactivation-dependent. In conclusion, ccRCC cells are characterized by high free iron levels and a cancer-specific dependency on iron for HIF-alpha overexpression, cell cycle progression and apoptotic escape. This iron dependency is introduced by VHL inactivation, revealing a novel interplay between VHL/HIF-alpha dysregulation and ccRCC iron metabolism. Future study is warranted to determine if iron deprivation using chelator drugs provides an effective therapeutic strategy for targeting HIF-2alpha and suppressing tumor progression in ccRCC patients.

AB  - This review focuses on discussing the main modifications of the recently published 2017 WHO Classification of Neoplasms of the Neuroendocrine Pancreas (panNEN). Recent updates separate pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors into 2 broad categories: well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNET) and poorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (panNEC), and incorporates a new subcategory of "well-differentiated high-grade NET (G3)" to the well-differentiated NET category. This new classification algorithm aims to improve the prediction of clinical outcomes and survival and help clinicians select better therapeutic strategies for patient care and management. In addition, these neuroendocrine neoplasms are capable of producing large quantity of hormones leading to clinical hormone hypersecretion syndromes. These functioning tumors include, insulinomas, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, gastrinomas, VIPomas, serotonin-producing tumors, and ACTH-producing tumors. Although most panNENs arise as sporadic diseases, a subset of these heterogeneous tumors present as parts on inherited genetic syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis, and glucagon cell hyperplasia and neoplasia syndromes. Characteristic clinical and morphologic findings for certain functioning and syndromic panNENs should alert both pathologists and clinicians as appropriate patient management and possible genetic counseling may be necessary.

AB  - Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCC) remains incurable despite advances in the development of anti-angiogenic targeted therapies and the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We have previously shown that the sonic hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway is oncogenic in CCC allowing us to identify the developmental Lim1 transcription factor as a Gli target and as a new oncogene in CCC regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and promoting tumor growth. In this previous study, preliminary in vitro results also suggested that Lim1 may be implicated in metastatic spread. Here we investigated the potential pro-metastatic role of Lim1 in advanced CCC (1) in vitro using a panel of CCC cell lines expressing or not the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene either naturally or by gene transfer and (2) ex vivo in 30 CCC metastatic tissues, including lymph nodes, lung, skin, bone, and adrenal metastases, and (3) in vivo, using a metastatic model by intravenous injection of siRNA-transfected cells into Balb/c nude. Our in vitro results reveal that Lim1 knockdown time-dependently decreased CCC cell motility, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity by up to 50% regardless of their VHL status. Investigating the molecular machinery involved in these processes, we identified a large panel of Lim1 targets known to be involved in cell adhesion (paxillin and fibronectin), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Twist1/2 and snail), invasion (MMP1/2/3/8/9), and metastatic progression (CXCR4, SDF-1, and ANG-1). Importantly, Lim1 was found constitutively expressed in all metastatic tissues. The H-score in metastatic tissues being significantly superior to the score in the corresponding primary tumor tissues (P value = 0.009). Furthermore, we showed that Lim1 silencing decreases pulmonary metastasis development in terms of number and size in the in vivo metastatic model of human CCC. Taken together, these experiments strengthen the potential therapeutic value of Lim1 targeting as a promising novel approach for treating metastatic human CCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in several malignancies. However, the expression level and clinical significance of PD-L1 in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-associated hereditary clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remain unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surgical specimens were recruited from 129 patients with sporadic ccRCC and 26 patients with VHL-associated hereditary ccRCC. The PD-L1 expression level was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Correlations between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed.
RESULTS: In sporadic ccRCC, the positive expression rate of PD-L1 was 47.3% (61/129). Positive PD-L1 expression was correlated with advanced tumor T stage (P = .011), higher Fuhrman nuclear grade (P = .022), poor disease-free survival (P = .037), and sex (P = .025). In the VHL-associated hereditary ccRCC, positive PD-L1 expression rate was 34.6% (9/26), lower than that in sporadic ccRCC. Positive PD-L1 was correlated with higher Fuhrman nuclear grade (P = .008), but not with sex, age, tumor stage, or the onset age of VHL-associated tumors.
CONCLUSION: Positive PD-L1 expression was correlated with the aggressive clinicopathological features in sporadic and VHL-associated hereditary ccRCC. Whether PD-L1 expression level in ccRCC is related to the effectiveness of programmed death-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy needs to be further investigated.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a genetic syndrome that involves the development of tumors in numerous organs. The kidney is one of the most frequently affected organs, and patients with VHL and renal tumors require repeated nephrectomy. The present study aimed to further determine the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which may allow more rational clinical treatment decisions. This study included 27 patients with VHL who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy at the Peking University First Hospital between January 2010 and April 2018. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of RCC-associated molecular markers was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The mean size of the renal tumors was 4.3+/-2.0 cm (range 1.3-9.5 cm). The pathological type in 26 cases (96.3%) was clear cell RCC (CCRCC), whereas only one patient was diagnosed with CCRCC and clear cell papillary RCC. Renal cysts with a clear cell lining were observed, and RCC cell clusters were scattered in renal cyst cavities. Among the 27 patients, 21 (77.8%) were diagnosed with stage IA/T1N0M0, according to Tumor-Node-Metastasis staging, and 16 (59.3%) had grade 1 tumors. The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 39.0+/-24.0 months (range, 1.7-96.5 months). No metastasis or VHL-associated mortality was observed. VHL-associated RCC is a relatively low-risk disease, and a tumor size of 4 cm was determined as a threshold for nephron-sparing surgery. In addition, to prevent tumor cell dispersion, renal cysts should be carefully treated. A comprehensive understanding of the clinicopathological characteristics and underlying mechanisms of RCC associated with VHL syndrome may improve patient prognosis.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common renal cell carcinoma subtype, and metastatic ccRCC is associated with 5-year survival rates of 10% to 20%. Genetically, ccRCC originates from sequential losses of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Remarkably, chromosome 3p loss occurs in more than 90% of sporadic ccRCCs. This results in concurrent one-copy loss of four tumor suppressor genes that are also mutated individually at high frequency in ccRCC (ie, VHL, 80%; PBRM1, 29% to 46%; BAP1, 6% to 19%; and SETD2, 8% to 30%). Pathogenically, 3p loss probably represents the first genetic event that occurs in sporadic ccRCC and the second genetic event in VHL-mutated hereditary ccRCC. VHL constitutes the substrate recognition module of the VCB-Cul2 E3 ligase that degrades HIF1/2a, whereas PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2 are epigenetic modulators that regulate gene transcription. Because 3p loss and VHL inactivation are nearly universal truncal events in ccRCC, the resulting HIF1/2 signaling overdrive and accompanied tumor hyper-vascularization probably underlie the therapeutic benefits observed with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, bevacizumab, cabo-zantinib, and lenvatinib. Furthermore, recent marked advances in ccRCC genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, molecular mechanisms, mouse models, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and clinical trials have rendered invaluable translational insights concerning precision kidney cancer therapeutics. With an armamentarium encompassing 13 drugs that exploit seven unique therapeutic mechanisms (ie, cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, mTORC1, cMET/AXL, fibroblast growth factor receptor, programmed cell death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1, and cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte associated-4) to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma, one of the imminent clinical questions concerning care of patients with metastatic ccRCC is how a personalized treatment strategy, through rationally combining and sequencing different therapeutic modalities, can be formulated to offer the best clinical outcome for individual patients. Here, we attempt to integrate recent discoveries of immediate translational impacts and discuss future translational challenges and opportunities.

AB  - The CRISPR-based technology has revolutionized genome editing in recent years. This technique allows for gene knockout and evaluation of function in cell lines in a manner that is far easier and more accessible than anything previously available. Unfortunately, the ability to extend these studies to in vivo syngeneic murine cell line implantation is limited by an immune response against cells transduced to stably express Cas9. In this study, we demonstrate that a non-integrating lentiviral vector approach can overcome this immune rejection and allow for the growth of transduced cells in an immunocompetent host. This technique enables the establishment of a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene knockout RENCA cell line in BALB/c mice, generating an improved model of immunocompetent, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

AB  - The genetic landscape of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) had been investigated extensively but its evolution patterns remained unclear. Here we analyze the clonal architectures of 473 patients from three different populations. We find that the mutational signatures vary substantially across different populations and evolution stages. The evolution patterns of ccRCC have great inter-patient heterogeneities, with del(3p) being regarded as the common earliest event followed by three early departure points: VHL and PBRM1 mutations, del(14q) and other somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) including amp(7), del(1p) and del(6q). We identify three prognostic subtypes of ccRCC with distinct clonal architectures and immune infiltrates: long-lived patients, enriched with VHL but depleted of BAP1 mutations, have high levels of Th17 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells while short-lived patients with high burden of SCNAs have high levels of Tregs and Th2 cells, highlighting the importance of evaluating evolution patterns in the clinical management of ccRCC.

AB  - Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its alpha-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-alpha to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.

AB  - Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors. These tumors are rare in children, and they may be associated with hereditary syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Most pediatric patients with pheochromocytoma present with sustained hypertension, while 10% to 69% of adult patients are asymptomatic. Herein, we present the case of a 12-yr-old Japanese girl with pheochromocytoma due to a germline mutation in the VHL (Arg161Gln). The only complaint was loss of weight. Pyrexia, anemia, and increases in C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin were observed. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a right adrenal gland tumor. Fractionated catecholamines and metanephrines in plasma and 24-h collected urine revealed elevated levels of norepinephrine and normetanephrine. Although hypertension and tachycardia were inapparent by an ordinary physical examination, paroxysmal mild hypertension and tachycardia were identified by a thorough examination after walking and abdominal compression. Paroxysmal hypertension and tachycardia were profound during operation. In conclusion, pheochromocytoma can be a consideration in the differential diagnosis of weight loss. Hypertension and tachycardia can be inapparent and paroxysmal in pediatric patients as well as in adults; thus, thorough assessment should be repeated.

AB  - The rapid transit from hypoxia to normoxia in the lung that follows the first breath in newborn mice coincides with alveolar macrophage (AM) differentiation. However, whether sensing of oxygen affects AM maturation and function has not been previously explored. We have generated mice whose AMs show a deficient ability to sense oxygen after birth by deleting Vhl, a negative regulator of HIF transcription factors, in the CD11c compartment (CD11cDELTAVhl mice). VHL-deficient AMs show an immature-like phenotype and an impaired self-renewal capacity in vivo that persists upon culture ex vivo. VHL-deficient phenotype is intrinsic in AMs derived from monocyte precursors in mixed bone marrow chimeras. Moreover, unlike control Vhl<sup>fl/fl</sup>, AMs from CD11cDELTAVhl mice do not reverse pulmonary alveolar proteinosis when transplanted into Csf2rb<sup>-/-</sup> mice, demonstrating that VHL contributes to AM-mediated surfactant clearance. Thus, our results suggest that optimal AM terminal differentiation, self-renewal, and homeostatic function requires their intact oxygen-sensing capacity.

AB  - Endolymphatic sac tumor (ELST) is a rare neoplasm arising in the temporal petrous region thought to originate from endolymphatic sac epithelium. It may arise sporadically or in association with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL). The ELST prevalence in VHL ranges from 3 to 16% and may be the initial presentation of the disease. Onset is usually in the 3rd to 5th decade with hearing loss and an indolent course. ELSTs present as locally destructive lesions with characteristic computed tomography imaging features. Histologically, they show papillary, cystic or glandular architectures. Immunohistochemically, they express keratin, EMA, and variably S100 and GFAP. Currently it is recommended that, given its rarity, ELST needs to be differentiated from other entities with similar morphologic patterns, particularly other VHL-associated neoplasms such as metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Nineteen ELST cases were studied. Immunohistochemistry (18/19) and single nucleotide polymorphism microarray testing was performed (12/19). Comparison with the immunophenotype and copy number profile in RCC is discussed. Patients presented with characteristic bone destructive lesions in the petrous temporal bones. Pathology of tumors showed characteristic ELST morphology with immunoexpression of CK7, GFAP, S100, PAX-8, PAX-2, CA-9 in the tumor cells. Immunostaines for RCC, CD10, CK20, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, thyroglobulin, and transthyretin were negative in the tumor cells. Molecular testing showed loss of 3p and 9q in 66% (8/12) and 58% (7/12) cases, respectively. Immunoreactivity for renal markers in ELST is an important diagnostic caveat and has not been previously reported. In fact, renal markers are currently recommended in order to rule out metastatic RCC although PAX gene complex and CA-9 have been implicated in the development of the inner ear. Importantly copy number assessment of ELST has not been previously reported. Loss of 3p (including the VHL locus) in ELST suggests similar mechanistic origins as ccRCC.

AB  - AIMS: Kinesin family member 11 (Kif11) is a member of the kinesin family motor proteins, which is associated with spindle formation and tumour genesis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kif11 expression and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) development.
METHODS: The relationship between Kif11 expression and CCRCC development was analysed by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR analyses, and tissue immunohistochemistry. The prognostic significance of Kif11 expression was explored by univariable and multivariable survival analyses of 143 included patients. Furthermore, SB743921 was used as a specific Kif11 inhibitor to treat 786-O cells with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process analysed by qRT-PCR, and cell survival rates analysed with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining followed by flow cytometric analyses. Disease-free survival curves of Kif11 with different cancers and the relationships between Kif11 and the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor gene (VHL), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in kidney cancer were further analysed using the GEPIA database.
RESULTS: The levels of Kif11 mRNA were significantly higher in CCRCC tissues compared with corresponding non-cancerous tissues. The results of immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression of Kif11 protein was significantly associated with clinicopathologial parameters, including nuclear grade and TNM stage. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated that high Kif11 expression, nuclear grade and TNM stage were independent factors to predict poor prognosis in patients with CCRCC. In addition, inhibition of Kif11 expression by SB743921 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and the EMT process with increased apoptosis rate.
CONCLUSIONS: These results combined with bioinformation analyses suggest that high Kif11 expression was associated with unfavourable prognosis in CCRCC and could be used as a potential prognostic marker in the clinical diagnosis of CCRCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No approved systemic therapy exists for von Hippel-Lindau disease, an autosomal dominant disorder with pleiotropic organ manifestations that include clear cell renal cell carcinomas; retinal, cerebellar, and spinal haemangioblastomas; pheochromocytomas; pancreatic serous cystadenomas; and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. We aimed to assess the activity and safety of pazopanib in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.
METHODS: In this non-randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, adult patients with clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease were recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and were treated with pazopanib (800 mg orally daily) for 24 weeks, with an option to continue treatment if desired by the patient and treating physician. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response and safety in the per-protocol population. The objective response was measured for each patient and each lesion type. Radiographic assessments were done at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout the study. Activity and safety were assessed with continuous monitoring and a Bayesian design. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01436227, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012, and Aug 10, 2016, we screened 37 patients with genetically confirmed or clinical features consistent with von Hippel-Lindau disease, of whom 31 eligible patients were treated with pazopanib. The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 42% (13 of 31 patients). By lesion sites responses were observed in 31 (52%) of 59 renal cell carcinomas, nine (53%) of 17 pancreatic lesions, and two (4%) of 49 CNS haemangioblastomas. Seven (23%) of 31 patients chose to stay on the treatment after 24 weeks. Four (13%) of 31 patients withdrew from the study because of grade 3 or 4 transaminitis, and three (10%) discontinued study treatment because of treatment intolerance with multiple intercurrent grade 1-2 toxicities. Treatment-related serious adverse events included one case each of appendicitis and gastritis and one patient had a fatal CNS bleed.
INTERPRETATION: Pazopanib was associated with encouraging preliminary activity in von Hippel-Lindau disease, with a side-effect profile consistent with that seen in previous trials. Pazopanib could be considered as a treatment choice for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and growing lesions, or to reduce the size of unresectable lesions in these patients. The safety and activity of pazopanib in this setting warrants further investigation.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by an infrequent number of somatic mutations. By contrast, epigenetic aberrations are commonly found in RCC, indicating that epigenetic reprogramming is an important event in RCC development. Epigenetic alterations comprise several different aberrations, such as changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNA levels, and occur in the most important signalling pathways in RCC, such as the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor (VHL)-hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, the WNT-beta-catenin pathway, and pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Owing to their involvement in these pathways and frequent occurrence in RCC, epigenetic alterations are regarded as potential biomarkers for the early detection of disease and for prediction of prognosis and treatment response. In addition, most of these alterations are potentially reversible, so they also provide new targets for therapy. At the moment, epigenetic biomarkers for RCC are not being used in clinical practice, but targeted epigenetic therapies are under investigation. Understanding the extent of epigenetic changes occurring in RCC and the mechanisms by which they influence disease progression and treatment response, as well as knowledge of current research on biomarkers and treatments, is crucial to successful clinical translation of epigenetics in RCC.

AB  - Recently, proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology is highlighted in drug discovery area as a new therapeutic approach. PROTAC as a heterobifunctional molecule is comprised of two ligands, which recruit target protein and E3 ligase, respectively. To degrade the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein, such as NPM-ALK or EML4-ALK, we generated several ALK-PROTAC molecules consisted of ceritinib, one of the ALK inhibitors, and ligand of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase. Among these molecules, TD-004 effectively induced ALK degradation and inhibited the growth of ALK fusion positive cell lines, SU-DHL-1 and H3122. We also confirmed that TD-004 significantly reduced the tumor growth in H3122 xenograft model.

AB  - Recent studies have reported that chemically synthesized double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), also known as small activating RNA (saRNAs), can specifically induce gene expression by targeting promoter sequences by a mechanism termed RNA activation (RNAa). In the present study, we designed 4 candidate saRNAs targeting the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene promoter. Among these saRNAs, dsVHL-821 significantly inhibited cell growth by up-regulating VHL at both the mRNA and protein levels in renal cell carcinoma 769-P cells. Functional analysis showed that dsVHL-821 induced apoptosis by increasing p53, decreasing Bcl-xL, activating caspase 3/7 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that dsVHL-821 increased the enrichment of Ago2 and RNA polymerase II at the dsVHL-821 target site. In addition, Ago2 depletion significantly suppressed dsVHL-821-induced up-regulation of VHL gene expression and related effects. Single transfection of dsVHL-821 caused long-lasting (14 days) VHL up-regulation. Furthermore, the activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 was accompanied by an increase in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of histone 4 (H4ac) and a decrease in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2) in the dsVHL-821 target region. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dsVHL-821, a novel saRNA for VHL, induces the expression of the VHL gene by epigenetic changes, leading to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and suggest that targeted activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 may be explored as a novel treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

AB  - von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, resulting in formation of multiple systemic tumors. Juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma (JRCH) is one of the major manifestations in VHL disease; however, treatments are challenging, especially in children. The present study reports the case of a 6-year-old girl with suspected VHL disease presenting with JRCH. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated marked dye leakage from the tumor. Retinal hemorrhage occurred around the tumor 7 months later. Laser photocoagulation of the tumor tissue was safely and successfully conducted without general anesthesia. The hemorrhage diminished after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated mild resolution of an elevated lesion in JRCH with contraction of the vitreoretinal interface over the tumor. Laser photocoagulation may be considered the first-line treatment for young patients with JRCH, although the primary physicians must have the necessary skills and be able to establish good doctor-patient relationships, even with children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NFPanNETs) may be sporadic or inherited because of germline mutations associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). The clinical behavior of NFPanNETs is difficult to predict, even in tumors of the same stage and grade. The authors analyzed genotype-specific patterns of transcriptional messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of NFPanNETs to understand the molecular features that determine PanNET phenotype.
METHODS: Thirty-two samples were included for genome-wide mRNA gene expression analysis (9 VHL-associated, 10 MEN1-associated, and 9 sporadic NFPanNETs and 4 purified normal islet cell [NIC] samples). Validation of genes was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by tumor genotype, and pathway analysis was curated.
RESULTS: Consensus clustering of mRNA expression revealed separate clustering of NICs, VHL-associated NFPanNETs, and MEN1-associated NFPanNETs; whereas some sporadic tumors clustered with MEN1. Four of 5 MEN1-like sporadic PanNET subtypes had loss of heterozygosity at the MEN1 gene locus. Pathway analysis demonstrated subtype-specific pathway activation, comprising angiogenesis and immune response in VHL; neuronal development in MEN1; protein ubiquitination in the new MEN1/sporadic subtype; and cytokinesis and cilium/microtubule development in sporadic NFPanNETs. Among many genes, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (Lef-1), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and CDK6 were upregulated in VHL or MEN1 NFPanNETs, providing potential subtype-specific treatment targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Distinct mRNA expression patterns were identified in sporadic-associated, VHL-associated, and MEN1-associated NFPanNETs. The current results uncover new pathways involved in NFPanNETs that are subtype-specific and provide potential new diagnostic or therapeutic targets based on tumor subtype.

AB  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the VHL tumor-suppressor gene, leading to the dysregulation of many hypoxia-induced genes. Affected individuals are at increased risk of developing recurrent and bilateral kidney cysts and dysplastic lesions which may progress to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Following the eponymous VHL gene inactivation, ccRCCs evolve through additional genetic alterations, resulting in both intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity. Genomic studies have identified frequent mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation. Currently, local therapeutic options include nephron-sparing surgery and alternative ablative procedures. For advanced metastatic disease, systemic treatment, including inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor pathways and mTOR pathways, as well as immunotherapy are available. Multimodal therapy, targeting multiple signaling pathways and/or enhancing the immune response, is currently being investigated. A deeper understanding of the fundamental biology of ccRCC development and progression, as well as the development of novel and targeted therapies will be accelerated by new preclinical models, which will greatly inform the search for clinical biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment.

AB  - Purpose We aimed to analyze the discordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based surrogate subtyping and PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and to assess overall survival (OS) according to discordance. Materials and Methods A total of 607 patients were analyzed. Hormone receptor (HR) expression was evaluated by IHC, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression was analyzed by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization. PAM50 intrinsic subtypes were determined according to 50 cancer genes using the NanoString nCounter Analysis System. We matched concordant tumor as luminal A and HR+/HER2-, luminal B and HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+ and HER2-enriched, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and normal- or basal-like. We used Ion Ampliseq Cancer Panel v2 was used to identify the genomic alteration related with discordance. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS. Results In total, 233 patients (38.4%) were discordant between IHC-based subtype and PAM50 intrinsic subtype. Using targeted sequencing, we detected somatic mutation-related discordant breast cancer including the VHL gene in the HR+/HER2- group (31% in concordant group, 0% in discordant group, p=0.03) and the IDH and RET genes (7% vs. 12%, p=0.02 and 0% vs. 25%, p=0.02, respectively) in the TNBC group. Among the luminal A/B patients with a discordant result had significantly worse OS (median OS, 73.6 months vs. not reached; p < 0.001), and among the patients with HR positivity, the basal-like group as determined by PAM50 showed significantly inferior OS compared to other intrinsic subtypes (5-year OS rate, 92.2% vs. 75.6%; p=0.01). Conclusion A substantial portion of patients showed discrepancy between IHC subtype and PAM50 intrinsic subtype in our study. The survival analysis demonstrated that current IHC-based classification could mislead the treatment and result in poor outcome. Current guidelines for IHC might be updated accordingly.

AB  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is inactivated frequently in sporadic clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) by genetic alteration (mutation, loss of heterozygosity, or promoter hypermethylation). However, the pathological or prognostic significance of VHL gene alteration has not been well defined. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between VHL alteration and clinopathologic findings in ccRCCs. We performed a systematic computerized search of online databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (up to July 2018). From ten studies, 1,082 patients were included in the pooled analyses of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pathological features (nuclear grade and disease stage) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for overall survival (OS). VHL alteration was not significantly associated with nuclear grade (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.59-1.06, p = 0.12) or disease stage (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.79-1.46, p = 0.65). There was also no significant correlation between VHL alteration and OS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.43-1.29, p = 0.30). When we pooled HRs for OS according to the VHL alteration types, the combined HRs were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.47-1.11, p = 0.14) for VHL mutations and 1.32 (95% CI: 0.70-2.47, p = 0.39) for methylation. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that VHL gene alteration is not significantly associated with the pathological features and survival in patients with ccRCC.

AB  - Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are rare and heterogeneous. Therefore, they often remain unrecognized for many years, causing significant disease burden.We here report on four unusual NEN presentations including a metastatic NEN of the kidney, hypoglycemia caused by an insulin-like growth factor-2-oma (previously called non-islet-cell tumor hypoglycemia), multifocal pheochromocytoma in von Hippel Lindau syndrome, and ileal NEN metastatic to the heart. One could say that each one of these tumors were Bblack swans^ and learning about them will increase further awareness of the spectrum of NEN.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is relatively resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) accounts for the majority of RCC, which have mutations or epigenetic silencing of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. VHL-positive Caki-2 cells are killed by an endogenous anticancer substance, 15-deoxy-DELTA<sup>12, 14</sup>-prostaglandin J<sub>2</sub> (15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>). The MTT reduction assay reflecting mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity was employed for assessment of cell viability. We confirmed anticancer activities of camptothecin (topoisomerase I inhibitor), etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor), doxorubicin (topoisomerase II inhibitor) in VHL-positive Caki-2 cells. Combination of topoisomerase inhibitors with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> exhibited the synergistic effect in VHL-positive Caki-2 cells. However, 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> did not increase cytotoxicities of topoisomerase inhibitors on VHL-negative 786-O cells. In addition, the 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>-enhanced antitumor activity of topoisomerase inhibitors was detected in neither VHL-positive nor VHL-negative RCC4 cells. Our finding indicated that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> enhanced the antitumor activity of topoisomerase inhibitors independently of VHL.

AB  - Pheochromocytomas (PCC) and paragangliomas (PGL) are rare neuroendocrine neoplasias that develop in the adrenal medulla or in the paravertebral extra-adrenal ganglia. Although they are more commonly benign (~75%) than malignant (~25%), they can be associated with a high degree of morbidity and a substantial mortality due to the hypersecretion of catecholamines or mass effects. Although PCC/PGL occur more commonly as sporadic tumors, about 30-40% are inherited and associated with predisposing germline mutations in more than 15 susceptibility genes. Several classic autosomal dominant tumor syndromes (von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2) are associated with an increased risk for the development of PCC/PGL. Mutations in the TMEM127, MAX, MDH2, FH, and EPAS1/HIF2A genes, among others, can be associated with PCC/PGL, and mutations in the genes encoding the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits A, B, C, and D or its cofactor SDHAF2 lead to a predisposition to developing paragangliomas (paraganglioma syndrome types 1-5). Mutational analysis of these susceptibility genes is of increasing clinical importance for the early identification and treatment of carriers, as well as genetic counseling. Important insights into the oncogenic events have been obtained through the recently completed comprehensive molecular characterization of 173 PCC/PGL in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. It has revealed a broad spectrum of somatic mutations (CSDE1, HRAS, RET, EPAS1, NF1) or rearrangements (MAML3, BRAF, NGFR, NF1) affecting several genes and pathways. A thorough understanding of the genetic susceptibility factors and the oncogenic mechanisms underlying PCC/PGL is essential for clinical management, genetic counseling, the identification of tumors with an aggressive behavior, and the development of novel targeted therapeutic modalities for metastatic tumors.

AB  - Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are rare in von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) but cause serious morbidity and mortality. Management guidelines for VHL-PanNETs continue to be based on limited evidence, and survival data to guide surgical management are lacking. We established the European-American-Asian-VHL-PanNET-Registry to assess data for risks for metastases, survival and long-term outcomes to provide best management recommendations. Of 2330 VHL patients, 273 had a total of 484 PanNETs. Median age at diagnosis of PanNET was 35 years (range 10-75). Fifty-five (20%) patients had metastatic PanNETs. Metastatic PanNETs were significantly larger (median size 5 vs 2 cm; P < 0.001) and tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was faster (22 vs 126 months; P = 0.001). All metastatic tumors were >=2.8 cm. Codons 161 and 167 were hotspots for VHL germline mutations with enhanced risk for metastatic PanNETs. Multivariate prediction modeling disclosed maximum tumor diameter and TVDT as significant predictors for metastatic disease (positive and negative predictive values of 51% and 100% for diameter cut-off >=2.8 cm, 44% and 91% for TVDT cut-off of <=24 months). In 117 of 273 patients, PanNETs >1.5 cm in diameter were operated. Ten-year survival was significantly longer in operated vs non-operated patients, in particular for PanNETs <2.8 cm vs >=2.8 cm (94% vs 85% by 10 years; P = 0.020; 80% vs 50% at 10 years; P = 0.030). This study demonstrates that patients with PanNET approaching the cut-off diameter of 2.8 cm should be operated. Mutations in exon 3, especially of codons 161/167 are at enhanced risk for metastatic PanNETs. Survival is significantly longer in operated non-metastatic VHL-PanNETs.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and is frequently accompanied by the genetic features of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) loss. VHL loss increases the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and their targets, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The primary treatment for metastatic RCC (mRCC) is molecular-targeted therapy, especially anti-angiogenic therapy. VEGF monoclonal antibodies and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the main drugs used in anti-angiogenic therapy. However, crosstalk between VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase or downstream pathways produce resistance to TKI treatment, and the multi-target inhibitors, HIF inhibitors or combination strategies are promising strategies for mRCC. HIFs are upstream of the crosstalk between the growth factors, and these factors may regulate the expression of VEGR, EGF, PDGF and other growth factors. The frequent VHL loss in ccRCC increases HIF expression, and HIFs may be an ideal candidate to overcome the TKI resistance. The combination of HIF inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors is also anticipated. Various clinical trials of programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors are planned. The present study reviews the effects of current and potential TKIs on mRCC, with a focus on VEGF/VEGFR and other targets for mRCC therapy.

AB  - Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are uncommon cancers arising from pancreatic islet cells. Here we report the analysis of gene mutation, copy number, and RNA expression of 57 sporadic well-differentiated pNETs. pNET genomes are dominated by aneuploidy, leading to concordant changes in RNA expression at the level of whole chromosomes and chromosome segments. We observed two distinct patterns of somatic pNET aneuploidy that are associated with tumor pathology and patient prognosis. Approximately 26% of the patients in this series had pNETs with genomes characterized by recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LoH) of 10 specific chromosomes, accompanied by bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation and generally poor clinical outcome. Another ~40% of patients had pNETs that lacked this recurrent LoH pattern but had chromosome 11 LoH, bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation, and universally good clinical outcome. The somatic aneuploidy allowed pathogenic germline variants (e.g., ATM) to be expressed unopposed, with RNA expression patterns showing inactivation of downstream tumor suppressor pathways. No prognostic associations were found with tumor morphology, single gene mutation, or expression of RNAs reflecting the activity of immune, differentiation, proliferative or tumor suppressor pathways. In pNETs, single gene mutations appear to be less important than aneuploidy, with MEN1 the only statistically significant recurrently mutated driver gene. In addition, only one pNET in the series had clearly actionable single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (in PTEN and FLCN) confirmed by corroborating RNA expression changes. The two clinically relevant patterns of LoH described here define a novel oncogenic mechanism and a plausible route to genomic precision oncology for this tumor type. Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Chuvash polycythemia is an autosomal recessive form of erythrocytosis associated with a homozygous p.Arg200Trp mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Since this discovery, additional VHL mutations have been identified in patients with congenital erythrocytosis, in a homozygous or compound-heterozygous state. VHL is a major tumor suppressor gene, mutations in which were first described in patients presenting with VHL disease, which is characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors. Here, we identify a new VHL cryptic exon (termed E1') deep in intron 1 that is naturally expressed in many tissues. More importantly, we identify mutations in E1' in 7 families with erythrocytosis (1 homozygous case and 6 compound-heterozygous cases with a mutation in E1' in addition to a mutation in VHL coding sequences) and in 1 large family with typical VHL disease but without any alteration in the other VHL exons. In this study, we show that the mutations induced a dysregulation of VHL splicing with excessive retention of E1' and were associated with a downregulation of VHL protein expression. In addition, we demonstrate a pathogenic role for synonymous mutations in VHL exon 2 that altered splicing through E2-skipping in 5 families with erythrocytosis or VHL disease. In all the studied cases, the mutations differentially affected splicing, correlating with phenotype severity. This study demonstrates that cryptic exon retention and exon skipping are new VHL alterations and reveals a novel complex splicing regulation of the VHL gene. These findings open new avenues for diagnosis and research regarding the VHL-related hypoxia-signaling pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a radiomics model with all-relevant imaging features from multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC and to investigate the possible radiogenomics link between the imaging features and a key ccRCC driver gene-the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutation.
METHODS: In this retrospective two-center study, two radiomics models were built using random forest from a training cohort (170 patients), where one model was built with all-relevant features and the other with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) features. A model combining all-relevant features and clinical factors (sex, age) was also built. The radiogenomics association between selected features and VHL mutation was investigated by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All models were tested on an independent validation cohort (85 patients) with ROC curves analysis.
RESULTS: The model with eight all-relevant features from corticomedullary phase CT achieved an AUC of 0.949 and an accuracy of 92.9% in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed the model with eight mRMR features (seven from nephrographic phase and one from corticomedullary phase) with an AUC of 0.851 and an accuracy of 81.2%. Combining age and sex did not benefit the performance. Five out of eight all-relevant features were significantly associated with VHL mutation, while all eight mRMR features were significantly associated with VHL mutation (false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC. Most subtype-discriminative imaging features were found to be significantly associated with VHL mutation, which may underlie the molecular basis of the radiomics features.
KEY POINTS: * All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC with high accuracy. * Most RCC-subtype-discriminative CT features were associated with the key RCC-driven gene-the VHL gene mutation. * Radiomics model can be more accurate and interpretable when the imaging features could reflect underlying molecular basis of RCC.

AB  - PURPOSE: This is the first single-institution study of its size to characterize the treatment impact and to address the question of whether hemangioblastoma treatment with Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKRS) in both sporadic and VHL patients changes the characteristic saltatory hemangioblastoma growth pattern.
METHODS: The authors reviewed a single-institution tumor registry to identify patients who had received GKRS for hemangioblastomas between January 1st, 1999, and December 31st, 2017.
RESULTS: 15 patients with 101 lesions met search criteria with a median age of first GKRS of 39.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] of 25.7-57.4 years), including 96 VHL and 5 sporadic lesions. The median time from GKRS to last follow-up was 5.4 years (IQR 2.3-11.5 years). 4 lesions (4%) and 3 patients (20%) experienced a local failure. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year freedom from new hemangioblastoma formation rates were 97%, 80%, and 46% respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed a reduction in tumor volume after GKRS. Several variables associated with a greater percent reduction in volume from GKRS to last follow-up: non-cystic status (p = .01), no prior craniotomy (p = .04), and follow-up time from GKRS (p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a successful long-term treatment option for hemangioblastomas changing the clinical course from saltatory growth to reduction in tumor volume. Non-cystic tumors and those without prior craniotomy were associated with a greater percent reduction in volume from GKRS at last follow-up.

AB  - Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose via the aerobic glycolysis pathway, which is also named as Warburg effect. Increasing evidence has suggested that suppression of glycolysis inhibits the progression of cancers. In this study, we found that the long non-coding RNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (GHET1) was overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Up-regulation of GHET1 was positively correlated with the tumor size and metastasis of the ovarian cancer patients. Overexpression of GEHT1 significantly promoted the proliferation and colony formation of ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, the candidate binding partners of GHET1 were explored by pull down and mass spectrum. Of note, GHET1 was found to interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which consequently blocked VHL-mediated degradation of HIF1alpha and enhanced the protein level of HIF1alpha in ovarian cancer cells. The up-regulated HIF1alpha promoted the glucose uptake and lactate generation of ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggested the oncogenic function of GHET1 via up-regulating the glycolysis in ovarian cancer and can be considered as a promising anti-cancer target.

AB  - Introduction & Objectives: To develop a radiomics model with all-relevant imaging features from multiphasic computed tomography (CT)for differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)from non-ccRCC, and to investigate the underlying molecular basis of the all-relevant imaging features by assessing their possible radiogenomics link with a key ccRCC driver gene - the VHL gene mutation. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective two-center study, 255 patients comprising 188 ccRCC and 67 non-ccRCC were included. 156 radiomics features were extracted from standardized triphasic CT. For differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC, two radiomics models were built using random forest from a training cohort (170 patients), where one model was built with all-relevant features selected by Boruta algorithm and the other with features selected by minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance ensemble (mRMRe)algorithm. A lassification model combing all-relevant features and clinical factors (sex and age)was also built using random forest. The potential radiogenomics association that linked the selected imaging features with the VHL mutation were investigated. All models were tested on an independent validation cohort (85 patients). Result(s): The radiomics model with eight all-relevant Boruta features (all from corticomedullary phase)achieved an AUC of 94.9% and an accuracy of 92.9% in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed the model with eight mRMRe features (seven from nephrographic phase and one from corticomedullary phase)with an AUC of 85.1% and an accuracy of 81.2% (p=0.023). Combining age and sex with all-relevant features did not benefit the classification performance. Seven out of eight selected all-relevant imaging features were significantly associated with VHL mutation, while all eight mRMRe imaging features were significantly associated with VHL mutation. The all-relevant radiomics model also succeeded in differentiating ccRCC from pRCC (AUC 99.1% and accuracy 95.9%)and from chRCC (AUC 90.7% and accuracy 93.2%), respectively. Conclusion(s): All-relevant radiomics features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC with high accuracy. These subtypediscriminative imaging features were found to be significantly associated with the VHL gene mutation. Copyright © 2019 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect VHL gene mutation in a pedigree affected with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL).
METHODS: Clinical data of the pedigree was reviewed. Patients were subjected to Sanger sequencing to detect mutation of the VHL gene. Structure of pVHL was predicted by 3D modeling using the swiss-model.
RESULTS: A novel c.426delT(p.V142fs) [NM_000551] mutation was found in exon 2 of the VHL gene. 3D modeling suggested that the alpha-structure of pVHL is completely absent.
CONCLUSION: The novel c.426delT(p.V142fs) mutation probably underlies the VHL in this pedigree.

AB  - Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that originate from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, and paragangliomas (PGLs) are extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. These can be mainly found in clinical syndromes including multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1) and familial paraganglioma (FPGL). PCCs and PGLs are thought to have the highest degree of heritability among human tumors, and it has been estimated that 60% of the patients have genetic abnormalities. This review provides an overview of the clinical syndrome and the genetic screening strategies of PCCs and PGLs. Comprehensive screening principles and strategies, along with specific screening based on clinical symptoms, biochemical tests and immunohistochemistry, are discussed.

AB  - CONTEXT: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease manifests as a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. Previous studies of VHL disease have documented several genotype-phenotype correlations; however, many such correlations are still unknown. Increased identification of new mutations and patients with previously described mutations will allow us to better understand how VHL mutations influence disease phenotypes.
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A total of 45 individuals from five unrelated families were evaluated, of which 21 patients were either diagnosed with VHL disease or showed strong evidence related to this disease. We compared the patients' gene sequencing results with their medical records including CT or MRI scans, eye examinations and laboratory/pathological examinations. Patients were also interviewed to obtain information regarding their family history.
RESULTS: We identified four missense mutations: c.239G>T (p.Ser80Ile), linked with VHL Type 2B, was associated with renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and hemangioma in the cerebellum; c.232A>T (p.Asn78Tyr) manifested as RCC alone and likely caused VHL Type 1; c.500G>A (p.Arg167Gln) mutation was more likely to cause VHL Type 2 than Type 1 as it preferentially induced Pheo and HB in the retina, cerebellum and spinal cord; c.293A>G (p.Try98Cys) was associated with Pheo and thus likely induced VHL Type 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Characterizing VHL disease genotype-phenotype correlations can enhance the ability to predict the risk of individual patients developing different VHL-related phenotypes. Ultimately, such insight will improve the diagnostics, surveillance and treatment of VHL patients.
PRECIS: Four missense mutations in VHL have been identified in 21 individuals when five unrelated Chinese families with VHL disease were analyzed; VHL mutations are highly associated with unique disease phenotypes.

AB  - PURPOSE: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome that reduces life expectancy. We aimed to construct a more valuable genotype-phenotype correlation based on alterations in VHL protein (pVHL).
METHODS: VHL patients (n = 339) were recruited and grouped based on mutation types: HIF-alpha binding site missense (HM) mutations, non-HIF-alpha binding site missense (nHM) mutations, and truncating (TR) mutations. Age-related risks of VHL-associated tumors and patient survival were compared.
RESULTS: Missense mutations conferred an increased risk of pheochromocytoma (HR = 1.854, p = 0.047) compared with truncating mutations. The risk of pheochromocytoma was lower in the HM group than in the nHM group (HR = 0.298, p = 0.003) but was similar between HM and TR groups (HR = 0.901, p = 0.810). Patients in the nHM group had a higher risk of pheochromocytoma (HR = 3.447, p < 0.001) and lower risks of central nervous system hemangioblastoma (CHB) (HR = 0.700, p = 0.045), renal cell carcinoma (HR = 0.610, p = 0.024), and pancreatic tumor (HR = 0.382, p < 0.001) than those in the combined HM and TR (HMTR) group. Moreover, nHM mutations were independently associated with better overall survival (HR = 0.345, p = 0.005) and CHB-specific survival (HR = 0.129, p = 0.005) than HMTR mutations.
CONCLUSION: The modified genotype-phenotype correlation links VHL gene mutation, substrate binding site, and phenotypic diversity (penetrance and survival), and provides more accurate information for genetic counseling and pathogenesis studies.

AB  - The data in genotype-phenotype correlation in Indian von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) patients is limited. We have retrospectively studied 31 genetically proven VHL patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PCC/PGL) from families and have reviewed the World literature on PCC/PGL in patients with large VHL deletions. Three patients had large deletions and 28 patients had other mutations [missense mutations in 25, 3 bp deletion in 2 and single bp duplication in one]. Unilateral PCC were significantly more common in patients with large VHL deletions whereas multiple PCC (bilateral PCC or PCC + sympathetic PGL) were significantly more common in those with other mutations. World literature review confirmed the rarity of PCC/PGL in patients with large deletions and we report the first definitive case of PCC associated with complete VHL deletion. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours were more common, often metastatic and the most common cause of death in our cohort. Our study had eight parent off-spring pairs from five families. The off-springs were significantly younger at presentation and had significantly higher number of PCC/PGL. In conclusion, PCC/PGL are rare in patients with large VHL deletions and if occur are most likely to be solitary. Patients with bilateral PCC or multifocal PCC/PGL are least likely to have large VHL deletions. Our study also provides additional evidence for existence of the phenomenon of anticipation in VHL syndrome.

AB  - Accelerated glycolysis, a common process in tumor cells called the Warburg effect, is associated with various biological phenomena. However, the role of glycolysis induced by arsenite, a well-established human carcinogen, is unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as regulators in various cancers, but how lncRNAs regulate glucose metabolism remains largely unexplored. We have found that, in human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells, arsenite increases lactate production; glucose consumption; and expression of glycolysis-related genes, including HK-2, Eno-1, and Glut-4. In L-02 cells exposed to arsenite, the lncRNA, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)-alpha, the transcriptional regulators of cellular response to hypoxia, are over-expressed. In addition, HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha, is involved in arsenite-induced glycolysis, and MALAT1 enhances arsenite-induced glycolysis. Although MALAT1 regulates HIF-alpha and promotes arsenite-induced glycolysis, MALAT1 promotes glycolysis through HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha. Moreover, arsenite-increased MALAT1 enhances the disassociation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor from HIF-1alpha, alleviating VHL-mediated ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha, which causes accumulation of HIF-1alpha. In sum, these findings indicate that MALAT1, acting through HIF-1alpha stabilization, is a mediator that enhances glycolysis induced by arsenite. These results provide a link between the induction of lncRNAs and the glycolysis in cells exposed to arsenite, and thus establish a previously unknown mechanism for arsenite-induced hepatotoxicity.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene and is accompanied by the development of both benign and malignant tumors. Clarithromycin (CAM) is a widely used anti-inflammatory drug that has also been proven effective for treating some cancers. In this study, we present a novel case of a 38-year-old female patient with VHL syndrome confirmed by computed tomography, with no relevant family history. The patient was only offered close follow-up observation after diagnosis, but was orally administered CAM twice daily when her disease progressed. After treatment for 3 months, her inner ear tumors had stopped growing and her kidney cysts had shrunk. Her pancreatic tumors treated with CAM showed no significant increase in size, and the lymph node swelling disappeared. CAM treatment was interrupted for 2 years and then stopped for 5 years when improvements were noted; the patient's condition thereafter gradually improved and finally stabilized with no obvious side effects. We discuss this case in the context of the published literature and consider the possible mechanisms of CAM action in the treatment of VHL syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with VHL syndrome treated with CAM.

AB  - PURPOSE: Genetic factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with around 3% of cases having a family history. A greater knowledge of the genetics of inherited RCC has the potential to translate into novel therapeutic targets for sporadic RCC.
METHODS: A literature review was performed summarising the current knowledge on hereditary RCC diagnosis, surveillance and management.
RESULTS: Familial RCC is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although inherited RCC may present without a relevant family history. A number of familial RCC syndromes have been identified. Familial non-syndromic RCC is suspected when >= 2 relatives are affected in the absence of syndromic features, although clear diagnostic criteria are lacking. Young age at onset and bilateral/multicentric tumours are recognised characteristics which should prompt molecular genetic analysis. Surveillance in individuals at risk of inherited RCC aims to prevent morbidity and mortality via early detection of tumours. Though screening and management guidelines for some inherited RCC syndromes (e.g. von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis) are well defined for rare cause of inherited RCC (e.g. germline BAP1 mutations), there is limited information regarding the lifetime RCC risks and the most appropriate screening modalities.
CONCLUSION: Increasing knowledge of the natural history and genetic basis has led to characterisation and tailored management of hereditary RCC syndromes. International data sharing of inherited RCC gene variant information may enable evidence-based improvements in the diagnosis, surveillance protocols and management of these rare conditions.

AB  - Concurrent multiple tumors developing in the spinal cord are rare, except for in genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis and von Hippel-Lindau disease. Furthermore, concurrent tumors arising in the same spinal level with discrete histopathology are much rarer. We report two such cases. Case 1: A 53-year-old man presented with intracranial hemorrhage that manifested as disturbed consciousness and right hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography demonstrated severe stenosis of the terminal portion of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, implying Moyamoya disease. Cranial MR images showed a hematoma in the left basal ganglia perforating into the lateral ventricle, which was incidentally detected as a spinal tumor compressing the cervical cord at the C2 level. After conservative management for cerebral hemorrhage, the patient underwent total removal of the spinal tumor. Surgical findings showed that the tumor consisted of extra- and intradural components. Histopathological findings showed that the extra- and intradural components were schwannoma and meningioma, respectively. Case 2: A 70-year-old man presented with progressive left hemiparesis and numbness in both lower extremities. Craniocervical MR images demonstrated a paraspinal tumor compressing the spinal cord at C2 level. Surgical findings disclosed that the tumor consisted of major extradural- and minor intradural components. Histopathological study showed that these components had discrete histological findings: extradural lesion was schwannoma and intradural lesion was meningioma. Concurrent tumors with discrete histopathology should be considered in tumors with extra- and intradural components, particularly, when they are located in the high cervical spine.

AB  - Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) latent in mRNA transcripts are thought to modify translation of coding sequences by altering ribosome activity. Not all uORFs are thought to be active in such a process. To estimate the impact of uORFs on the regulation of translation in humans, we first circumscribed the universe of all possible uORFs based on coding gene sequence motifs and identified 1.3 million unique uORFs. To determine which of these are likely to be biologically relevant, we built a simple Bayesian classifier using 89 attributes of uORFs labeled as active in ribosome profiling experiments. This allowed us to extrapolate to a comprehensive catalog of likely functional uORFs. We validated our predictions using in vivo protein levels and ribosome occupancy from 46 individuals. This is a substantially larger catalog of functional uORFs than has previously been reported. Our ranked list of likely active uORFs allows researchers to test their hypotheses regarding the role of uORFs in health and disease. We demonstrate several examples of biological interest through the application of our catalog to somatic mutations in cancer and disease-associated germline variants in humans.

AB  - The most common type of the renal cancers detected in humans is clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). These tumors are usually initiated by biallelic gene inactivation of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) factor in the renal epithelium, which deregulates the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha, and provokes their constitutive activation irrespective of the cellular oxygen availability. While HIF1alpha can act as a ccRCC tumor suppressor, HIF2alpha has emerged as the key HIF isoform that is essential for ccRCC tumor progression. Indeed, preclinical and clinical data have shown that pharmacological inhibitors of HIF2alpha can efficiently combat ccRCC growth. In this review, we discuss the molecular basis underlying the oncogenic potential of HIF2alpha in ccRCC by focusing on those pathways primarily controlled by HIF2alpha that are thought to influence the progression of these tumors.

AB  - Most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) have inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), resulting in the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha-subunits (HIF-alpha) and their downstream targets. HIF-2alpha expression is particularly high in ccRCC and is associated with increased ccRCC growth and aggressiveness. In the canonical HIF signaling pathway, HIF-prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) suppresses HIF-2alpha protein by post-translational hydroxylation under sufficient oxygen availability. Here, using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR, and siRNA-mediated gene silencing, we show that unlike in the canonical pathway, PHD3 silencing in ccRCC cells leads to down-regulation of HIF-2alpha protein and mRNA. Depletion of other PHD family members had no effect on HIF-2alpha expression, and PHD3 knockdown in non-RCC cells resulted in the expected increase in HIF-2alpha protein expression. Accordingly, PHD3 knockdown decreased HIF-2alpha target gene expression in ccRCC cells and expression was restored upon forced HIF-2alpha expression. The effect of PHD3 depletion was pinpointed to HIF2A mRNA stability. In line with these in vitro results, a strong positive correlation of PHD3 and HIF2A mRNA expression in ccRCC tumors was detected. Our results suggest that in contrast to the known negative regulation of HIF-2alpha in most cell types, high PHD3 expression in ccRCC cells maintains elevated HIF-2alpha expression and that of its target genes, which may enhance kidney cancer aggressiveness.

AB  - Introduction Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a complex disorder, in which increased oxygen demand of tissues results in a complex setting of neoplastic disorders: i.e. clear cell renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hemangiomas, Lindau tumor, etc., usually appearing well before the age of forty, and usually without polyglobulia. The background of this disease are a series of mutation in VHL gene. This is positioned on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26). There are over 1500 germline mutations and somatic mutations found or identified in VHL disease. Some rare cases of mutated VHL gene might induce isolated polycythemia, interestingly these cases the other tumors are missing: so it is recommended to check VHL gene in polycythemia if aetiology otherwise not explained. Much less is known about non classical VHL mutations, but just simple VHL polymorphism issues (usually considered innocent, no clinical significance). Wen-Chu Wang et al. BMC Res Notes, 7:628, 2014, VHL polymorphism: Not at all are innocents, at least two single nucleotide polymorphisms of them are not insignificant on clinical grounds. For example Rs779805 polymorphism associates clear renal cell cancer in Taiwan and Mainland China more frequently, but, much less in caucasian population. Somewhat more prostatic and large bowel cancer have been found in this polymorphism, as well. VHL polymorphism Rs1642742: similar disorder association and geographic distribution. However, no blood count abnormalities mentioned in these Chinese reports. Patients and Methods We referred some patient samples gained from eastern Hungary (roughly 2 Million population) with polycythemia like syndrome without Jak2 V617F or exon 12 mutations, no mpl W515 mutation, with low or normal erythropoietin and O2 saturation values (during the past 4 years). We eagerly screened VHL gene in the patients especially if they were young (under 30) or there was evidence of familiar polyglobulia pattern or more cancer. VHL sequenations were performed: VHL gene coding regions: We performed the PCR amplification of intron (IVS1-195-nt) before 1st exon sequences PCR amplification, followed by direct fluorescent sequenation. This work had been performed by Zsuzsanna Bereczky, University Laboratory Medicine institute, her work is kindly acknowledged and highly appreciated Results 1. We have found, even to our surprise,13 patients or probands with the same VHL homo or heterozygous VHL polymorphism, namely the intron (IVS1-195-nt) before the 1st exon: i.e. rs779805 G>A, similar to what had been described in chinese population without blood count abnormalities (but associations with solid tumours) 2. None of the samples so far sequenced revealed true, classical VHL gene mutation. 3. We have found additional cancers in five families: clear renal cell cancer (1), large bowel cancer (2) , melanoma (1) in the same family. more sporadic large bowel cancers, a single Hodgkin lymphoma, bony tumour, gynecological cancers (might or might not be coincidental). There were some patients (during family exploration) who had hemoglobin level over 190 g/L under the age of twenty. 4. Clinical features: Most patients were unusually young. High hemoglobin/red cell count was isolated in most instances, normal white blood cell or platelet counts. Aquagenic pruritus was usually absent, two cases had very mild, atypical itching. Spleen sizes were normal in all cases. In respect of transformation the two-four years observational period is irrelevantly short. Bone marrow examinations were performed in some cases, with normal description and analysis results. We used cautious phlebotomies, targeting 0,52 hematocrit levels. All of them were advised smoking cessation. We performed ultrasound and simple cancer screening on a yearly basis, which we do recommend further on. 5. by chance we identified one young polycythemia patients with same polymorphism and in addition Jak2 V617F mutated status. Conclusion(s): we do recommend VHL gene sequenation in young patients with otherwise unxplained polyglobulia, especially if there is any sign of familiarity, or unusual precipitation of cancer in the family. We are extending our family screening more deeply, and try to gain data on this polymorphism in 100 young healthy volunteers, analysing their bloofd counts and complex family history. We plan careful hematologic and oncologic followup of our patients and first degree relatives.

TY  - JOUR
AB  - Introduction Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a complex disorder, in which increased oxygen demand of tissues results in a complex setting of neoplastic disorders: i.e. clear cell renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hemangiomas, Lindau tumor, etc., usually appearing well before the age of forty, and usually without polyglobulia. The background of this disease are a series of mutation in VHL gene.This is positioned on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26). There are over 1500 germline mutations and somatic mutations found or identified in VHL disease. Some rare cases of mutated VHL gene might induce isolated polycythemia, interestingly these cases the other tumors are missing: so it is recommended to check VHL gene in polycythemia if aetiology otherwise not explained. Much less is known about non classical VHL mutations, but just simple VHL polymorphism issues (usually considered innocent, no clinical significance). Wen-Chu Wang et al. BMC Res Notes, 7:628, 2014, VHL polymorphism: Not at all are innocents, at least two single nucleotide polymorphisms of them are not insignificant on clinical grounds. For example Rs779805 polymorphism associates clear renal cell cancer in Taiwan and Mainland China more frequently, but, much less in caucasian population. Somewhat more prostatic and large bowel cancer have been found in this polymorphism, as well. VHL polymorphism Rs1642742: similar disorder association and geographic distribution. However, no blood count abnormalities mentioned in these Chinese reports. Patients and Methods We referred some patient samples gained from eastern Hungary (roughly 2 Million population) with polycythemia like syndrome without Jak2 V617F or exon 12 mutations, no mpl W515 mutation, with low or normal erythropoietin and O2 saturation values (during the past 4 years). We eagerly screened VHL gene in the patients especially if they were young (under 30) or there was evidence of familiar polyglobulia pattern or more cancer. VHL sequenations were performed: VHL gene coding regions: We performed the PCR amplification of intron (IVS1-195-nt) before 1st exon sequences PCR amplification, followed by direct fluorescent sequenation. This work had been performed by Zsuzsanna Bereczky, University Laboratory Medicine institute, her work is kindly acknowledged and highly appreciated Results 1. We have found, even to our surprise,13 patients or probands with the same VHL homo or heterozygous VHL polymorphism, namely the intron (IVS1-195-nt) before the 1st exon: i.e. rs779805 G>A, similar to what had been described in chinese population without blood count abnormalities (but associations with solid tumours) 2. None of the samples so far sequenced revealed true, classical VHL gene mutation. 3. We have found additional cancers in five families: clear renal cell cancer (1), large bowel cancer (2), melanoma (1) in the same family. more sporadic large bowel cancers, a single Hodgkin lymphoma, bony tumour, gynecological cancers (might or might not be coincidental). There were some patients (during family exploration) who had hemoglobin level over 190 g/L under the age of twenty. 4. Clinical features: Most patients were unusually young. High hemoglobin/red cell count was isolated in most instances, normal white blood cell or platelet counts. Aquagenic pruritus was usually absent, two cases had very mild, atypical itching. Spleen sizes were normal in all cases. In respect of transformation the two-four years observational period is irrelevantly short. Bone marrow examinations were performed in some cases, with normal description and analysis results. We used cautious phlebotomies, targeting 0,52 hematocrit levels. All of them were advised smoking cessation. We performed ultrasound and simple cancer screening on a yearly basis, which we do recommend further on. 5. by chance we identified one young polycythemia patients with same polymorphism and in addition Jak2 V617F mutated status. Conclusion(s): we do recommend VHL gene sequenation in young patients with otherwise unxplained polyglobulia, especially if there is any sign of familiarity, or unusual precipitation of cancer in the family. We are extending our family screening more deeply, and try to gain data on this polymorphism in 100 young healthy volunteers, analysing their bloofd counts and complex family history. We plan careful hematologic and oncologic followup of our patients and first degree relatives.

AB  - Familiar cancers represent a privileged point of view for studying the complex cellular events inducing tumor transformation. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a familiar predisposition to develop cancer is a clear example. Here, we present our efforts to decipher the role of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) in cancer insurgence. We collected high quality information about both pVHL mutations and interactors to investigate the association between patient phenotypes, mutated protein surface and impaired interactions. Our data suggest that different phenotypes correlate with localized perturbations of the pVHL structure, with specific cell functions associated to different protein surfaces. We propose five different pVHL interfaces to be selectively involved in modulating proteins regulating gene expression, protein homeostasis as well as to address extracellular matrix (ECM) and ciliogenesis associated functions. These data were used to drive molecular docking of pVHL with its interactors and guide Petri net simulations of the most promising alterations. We predict that disruption of pVHL association with certain interactors can trigger tumor transformation, inducing metabolism imbalance and ECM remodeling. Collectively taken, our findings provide novel insights into VHL-associated tumorigenesis. This highly integrated in silico approach may help elucidate novel treatment paradigms for VHL disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: Clear cell, papillary cell, and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) have now been well characterised thanks to large collaborative projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Not only has knowledge of the genomic landscape helped inform the development of new drugs, it also promises to fine tune prognostication.
METHODS: A literature review was performed summarising the current knowledge on the genetic basis of RCC.
RESULTS: The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene undergoes bi-allelic knockout in the vast majority of clear cell RCCs. The next most prevalent aberrations include a cohort of chromatin-modifying genes with diverse roles including PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, and KMD5C. The most common non-clear cell renal cancers have also undergone genomic profiling and are characterised by distinct genomic landscapes. Many recurrent mutations have prognostic value and show promise in aiding decisions regarding treatment stratification. Intra-tumour heterogeneity appears to hamper the clinical applicability of sparsely sampled tumours. Ways to abrogate heterogeneity will be required to optimise the genomic classification of tumours.
CONCLUSION: The somatic mutational landscape of the more common renal cancers is well known. Correlation with outcome needs to be more comprehensively furnished, particularly for small renal masses, rarer non-clear cell renal cancers, and for all tumours undergoing targeted therapy.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by near-universal loss of the short arm of chromosome 3, deleting several tumor suppressor genes. We analyzed whole genomes from 95 biopsies across 33 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We find hotspots of point mutations in the 5' UTR of TERT, targeting a MYC-MAX-MAD1 repressor associated with telomere lengthening. The most common structural abnormality generates simultaneous 3p loss and 5q gain (36% patients), typically through chromothripsis. This event occurs in childhood or adolescence, generally as the initiating event that precedes emergence of the tumor's most recent common ancestor by years to decades. Similar genomic changes drive inherited ccRCC. Modeling differences in age incidence between inherited and sporadic cancers suggests that the number of cells with 3p loss capable of initiating sporadic tumors is no more than a few hundred. Early development of ccRCC follows well-defined evolutionary trajectories, offering opportunity for early intervention.

AB  - The majority of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are sporadic while 10-15% are attributable to one of several familial cancer syndromes. Hereditary forms are more commonly associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type I and von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. However, patients with Tuberous sclerosis complex also have an increased incidence of PNETs. More often this has been reported in patients with TSC2 variants. In this case report, we summarize the literature regarding PNETs associated with Tuberous sclerosis complex, as well as present a case of a patient with a TSC1 variant and a PNET. This case highlights the association of TSC1 gene variants with these tumors and emphasizes the importance of considering such diagnoses in this patient population.

AB  - Hypoxic zones are common features of metastatic tumors. Due to inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL), renal cell carcinomas (RCC) show constitutive stabilization of the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Thus, RCC represents a model of chronic hypoxia. Development of the lymphatic network is dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) and lies at the front line of metastatic spreading. Here, we addressed the role of VEGFC in RCC aggressiveness and the regulation of its expression in hypoxia. <b>Methods:</b> Transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation of VEGFC expression was evaluated by qPCR and with reporter genes. The involvement of HIF was evaluated using a siRNA approach. Experimental RCC were performed with immuno-competent/deficient mice using human and mouse cells knocked-out for the VEGFC gene by a CRISPR/Cas9 method. The VEGFC axis was analyzed with an online available data base (TCGA) and using an independent cohort of patients. <b>Results:</b> Hypoxia induced VEGFC protein expression but down-regulated VEGFC gene transcription and mRNA stability. Increased proliferation, migration, over-activation of the AKT signaling pathway and enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers characterized VEGFC-/- cells. VEGFC-/- cells did not form tumors in immuno-deficient mice but developed aggressive tumors in immuno-competent mice. These tumors showed down-regulation of markers of activated lymphocytes and M1 macrophages, and up-regulation of M2 macrophages markers and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1). Over-expression of lymphangiogenic genes including VEGFC was linked to increased disease-free and overall survival in patients with non-metastatic tumors, whereas its over-expression correlated with decreased progression-free and overall survival of metastatic patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study revisited the admitted dogma linking VEGFC to tumor aggressiveness. We conclude that targeting VEGFC for therapy must be considered with caution.

AB  - Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional crosslinking enzyme that displays transamidation, protein disulfide isomerase, protein kinase, as well as GTPase and ATPase activities. TG2 can also act as an adhesion molecule involved in the syndecan and integrin receptor signaling. In recent years, TG2 was implicated in cancer progression, survival, invasion, migration, and stemness of many cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Von Hippel-Lindau mutations leading to the subsequent activation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)-1-mediated signaling pathways, survival signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway resulting in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) metastasis and angiogenesis are the main factors in RCC progression. A number of studies have shown that TG2 was important in HIF-1- and PI3K-mediated signaling, VHL and p53 stabilization, glycolytic metabolism and migratory phenotype in RCC. This review focuses on the role of TG2 in the regulation of molecular pathways nurturing not only the development and propagation of RCC, but also drug-resistance and metastatic potential.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most commonly occurring solid cancer of the adult kidney with the majority of RCC cases being detected accidentally. The most aggressive subtype is clear cell RCC (ccRCC). miRNAs, a family of small noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression have been identified as key biological modulators. The von Hippel-Lindau pathway is one of the signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of ccRCC. Another oncogenic mechanism involves the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and serves as a central regulator of cell metabolism, proliferation and survival. Several studies have described the involvement of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis and progression of ccRCC. These molecules can be considered as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, allowing response to therapy to be monitored.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Furthermore, dysregulation of miRNA expression is an important factor in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. Our previous study identified that overexpression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-induced protein 1 protein led to a significant downregulation of a novel miRNA molecule, miRNA-3613-3p. In the present study, the potential involvement of miRNA-3613-3p in the cell biology of neuroblastoma was investigated. It was identified that the expression of miRNA-3613-3p varies among a range of human neuroblastoma cell lines. As the delineation of the functions of a miRNA requires the identification of its target genes, seven putative mRNAs that may be regulated by miRNA-3613-3p were selected. Furthermore, it was identified that overexpression of miRNA-3613-3p causes significant downregulation of several genes exhibiting tumor suppressive potential [encoding apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1), Dicer, DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta, von Hippel-Lindau protein and neurofibromin 1] in BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cells. APAF1 mRNA was the most significantly decreased transcript in the cells with miRNA-3613-3p overexpression. In accordance with the aforementioned results, the downregulation of cleaved caspase-9 and lack of activation of executive caspases in BE(2)-C cells following miRNA-3613-3p overexpression was observed. The results of the present study suggest a potential underlying molecular mechanism of apoptosis inhibition via APAF1 downregulation in human neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells with miRNA-3613-3p overexpression.

AB  - Ankyrin repeat (ANK) domains are among the most abundant motifs in eukaryotic proteins. ANK proteins are rare amongst viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, which presumably acquired them from the host via horizontal gene transfer. The architecture of poxvirus ANK proteins is, however, different from that of their cellular counterparts, and this precludes a direct acquisition event. Here we combine bioinformatics analysis and quantitative proteomics to discover a new class of viral ANK proteins with a domain organization that relates to cellular ANK proteins. These noncanonical viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, interact with host Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box resembling that of cellular Cullin-2 substrate adaptors such as the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Mutagenesis of the BC box-like sequence abrogates binding to Cullin-2, whereas fusion of this motif to an ANK-only protein confers Cullin-2 association. We demonstrated that these viral ANK/BC proteins are potent immunomodulatory proteins suppressing the activation of the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-B and interferon (IFN)-responsive factor 3 (IRF-3) and the production of cytokines and chemokines, including interferon, and that association with Cullin-2 is required for optimal inhibitory activity. ANK/BC proteins exist in several orthopoxviruses and cluster into 2 closely related orthologue groups in a phylogenetic lineage that is separate from that of canonical ANK/F-box proteins. Given the existence of cellular proteins with similar architecture, viral ANK/BC proteins may be closely related to the original ANK gene acquired by an ancestral orthopoxvirus. These findings uncover a novel viral strategy to antagonize innate immunity and shed light on the origin of the poxviral ANK protein family. Copyright © 2018 Odon et al.

Most of these genes were originally acquired from the host and subsequently adapted to benefit the virus. ANK proteins are common in eukaryotes but are unusual amongst viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, where they represent one of the largest protein families. We report here the existence of a new class of viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, that provide new insights into the origin of poxvirus ANK proteins. ANK/BC proteins target the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box domain and are potent suppressors of the production of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon. The existence of cellular ANK proteins whose architecture is similar suggests the acquisition of a host ANK/BC gene by an ancestral orthopoxvirus and its subsequent duplication and adaptation to widen the repertoire of immune evasion strategies.

AB  - The local anesthetic lidocaine induces cell death by altering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial electron transport chain function. Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is involved in determining oxygen metabolism and mitochondria function, we investigated the involvement of HIF-1 activity in lidocaine-induced cell death. We investigated the role of HIF activation on lidocaine-induced caspase activation and cell death in renal cell-derived RCC4 cells lacking functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. We demonstrate that HIF-1 suppressed oxygen consumption and facilitated glycolysis in a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1-dependent manner and that activation of HIF-1 conferred resistance to lidocaine-induced cell death. We also demonstrated that exogenous HIF-1 activation, through HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibition or exposure to hypoxic conditions, alleviates lidocaine toxicity by suppressing mitochondria function and generating ROS, not only in RCC4 cells, but also in the neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HIF-1 activation due to VHL deletion, treatment with small molecule HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors, and exposure to hypoxic conditions suppresses mitochondrial respiratory chain function and confers resistance to lidocaine toxicity.

AB  - Primary cilia are sensory organelles involved in regulation of cellular signaling. Cilia loss is frequently observed in tumors; yet, the responsible mechanisms and consequences for tumorigenesis remain unclear. We demonstrate that cilia structure and function is disrupted in human pheochromocytomas - endocrine tumors of the adrenal medulla. This is concomitant with transcriptional changes within cilia-mediated signaling pathways that are associated with tumorigenesis generally and pheochromocytomas specifically. Importantly, cilia loss was most dramatic in patients with germline mutations in the pseudohypoxia-linked genes SDHx and VHL. Using a pheochromocytoma cell line derived from rat, we show that hypoxia and oncometabolite-induced pseudohypoxia are key drivers of cilia loss and identify that this is dependent on activation of an Aurora-A/ HDAC6 cilia resorption pathway. We also show cilia loss drives dramatic transcriptional changes associated with proliferation and tumorigenesis. Our data provide evidence for primary cilia dysfunction contributing to pathogenesis of pheochromocytoma by a hypoxic/pseudohypoxic mechanism and implicates oncometabolites as ciliary regulators. This is important as pheochromocytomas can cause mortality by mechanisms including catecholamine production and malignant transformation, while hypoxia is a general feature of solid tumors. Moreover, pseudohypoxia-induced cilia resorption can be pharmacologically inhibited, suggesting potential for therapeutic intervention. Copyright © 2019 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

AB  - A 29-year-old hypertensive male with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome came to the Endocrinology department for evaluation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an adrenal mass, bilateral renal cell carcinoma, and multiple pancreatic cysts. The hormonal investigations for adrenal mass were normal. He underwent left-sided adrenalectomy, and the histopathological report was suggestive of an adrenocortical adenoma. Genetic analysis of VHL gene in this patient revealed a heterogeneous 5' splice site variation of intron 1 of the VHL gene that affects splice site of exon 1 (c. 340 + 1G > A). Adrenocortical adenoma is very rare in VHL syndrome. Only two cases of adrenocortical adenoma in VHL have been reported in the literature, and both were associated with pheochromocytoma.

AB  - EPAS1 encodes HIF2 and is closely related to high altitude chronic hypoxia. Mutations in the EPAS1 coding sequence are associated with several kinds of human diseases, including syndromic congenital heart disease (CHD). However, whether there are rare EPAS1 coding variants related to Tibetan non-syndromic CHD have not been fully investigated. A group of 286 Tibetan patients with non-syndromic CHD and 250 unrelated Tibetan healthy controls were recruited from Qinghai, China. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify variations in the EPAS1 coding sequence. The novelty of identified variants was confirmed by the examination of 1000G and ExAC databases. Control samples were screened to establish that the rare candidate variants were specific to the Tibetan patients with non-syndromic CHD. Bioinformatics software was used to assess the conservation of the mutations and to predict their effects. The effect of EPAS1 mutations on the transcription of its target gene, VEGF, was assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The mammalian two-hybrid assay was used to study the protein interactions between HIF2 and PHD2 or pVHL. We identified two novel EPAS1 mutations (NM 001430: c.607A>C, p.N203H; c.2170G>T, p.G724W) in two patients. The N203H mutation significantly affected the transcription activity of the VEGF promoter, especially in conditions of hypoxia. The N203H mutation also showed enhanced protein-protein interactions between HIF2 and PHD2, and HIF2 and pVHL, especially in conditions of hypoxia. However, the G724W mutation did not demonstrate the same effects. Our results indicate that EPAS1 mutations might have a potential causative effect on the development of Tibetan non-syndromic CHD.

AB  - A novel mutation in the MLH1 gene likely to be pathogenic for Lynch syndrome was discovered in a proband with a family history of colon cancer. Immunohistochemistry showed negative expression of PMS2 and MLH1 in the resected tumor sample. The mutation lies at the highly conserved C-Terminus of the MLH1 protein, the region through which it dimerizes with PMS2 to carry out its mismatch repair function.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common and lethal form of urological cancer diagnosed globally. Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene and the resultant overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein are considered hallmarks of ccRCC. Persistently activated HIF-1alpha is associated with increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), consequently leading to ccRCC progression and metastasis to other organs. However, the VHL status alone cannot predict the differential sensitivity of ccRCC to cancer treatments, which suggests that other molecular differences may contribute to the differential response of ccRCC cells to drug therapies. In this study, we investigated the response to metformin (an antidiabetic drug) of two human ccRCC cell lines Caki-1 and Caki-2, which express wild-type VHL. Our findings demonstrate a differential response between the two ccRCC cell lines studied, with Caki-2 cells being more sensitive to metformin compared to Caki-1 cells, which could be linked to the differential expression of HIF-1 despite both cell lines carrying a wild-type VHL. Our study unveils the therapeutic potential of metformin to inhibit the progression of ccRCC in vitro. Additional preclinical and clinical studies are required to ascertain the therapeutic efficacy of metformin against ccRCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the main causes of death in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. However, the natural history of VHL-related RCC has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. This report described the natural history of VHL-related RCC in a large Chinese VHL cohort and might be helpful in the surveillance and treatment of VHL disease.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 196 renal tumours from 150 patients with VHL disease. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the influence of age of onset, sex, family history, unilateral or bilateral tumour, VHL disease type, mutation type, mutation location, and tumour size on tumour growth, metastasis and survival in patients with VHL disease.
RESULTS: The mean age of onset was 38.8 years, and the mean initial tumour size was 3.1 cm. The mean linear growth rate was 0.49 cm/year. Patients experienced faster tumour growth when they had later age of onset, larger initial tumour size, missense mutation, mutations locating in exon 3, and when they were not affected by cerebral or retinal haemangioblastomas. Tumours larger than 4 cm grew faster than those smaller than 4 cm. Bilateral tumours, large initial tumours, fast tumour growth and metastasis were risk factors for poor prognosis in VHL-related RCC.
CONCLUSION: This large study demonstrated that age of onset, initial tumour size, concomitant tumours, mutation type and mutation location had an effect on growth rate in VHL-related RCC. Active surveillance may be safe for patients with tumour size less than 4 cm, which is helpful in clinical decision-making.

AB  - A heightened understanding of hereditary renal cancer syndromes and their molecular basis has led to an increased awareness and recognition of these renal neoplasms by pathologists. Because a diagnosis of hereditary renal cell carcinoma has a profound impact on the patient and family members, when and how to raise such a suspicion via pathologic assessment has become an important yet very challenging task. This review discusses key clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic characteristics of hereditary renal cancer syndromes, and important differential diagnostic challenges, emphasizing recent pathologic and molecular advances.

AB  - Trichloroethylene (TCE) and inorganic arsenic (iAs) are environmental contaminants that can target the kidney. Chronic exposure to TCE is associated with increased incidence of renal cell carcinoma, while co-exposure to TCE and iAs likely occurs in exposed human populations, such as those near Superfund sites. In order to better understand the kidney health consequences of TCE and/or iAs exposure, a genetically heterogeneous mouse population derived from FVB/NJ and CAST/EiJ mouse strains and deficient for multidrug resistance genes (Abcb1a<sup>tm1Bor</sup>, Abcb1b<sup>tm1Bor</sup> ) was chronically exposed for 52-weeks to varying concentrations of TCE and iAs. Although no exposure group resulted in primary renal cell tumors, kidneys from exposed mice did have significant increases in histologic and biochemical evidence of renal tubular disease with each toxicant alone and with combined exposure, with males having significantly higher levels of damage. Although no added increase in tubular disease was observed with combination exposure compared to single toxicants, molecular changes in kidneys from mice that had the combined exposure were similar to those previous observed in an embryonic stem cell assay for the P81S TCE-induced renal cell carcinoma mutation in the Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) gene.While this model more accurately reflects human exposure conditions, development of primary renal tumors observed in humans following chronic TCE exposure was not reproduced even after inclusion of genetic heterogeneity and co-carcinogenic iAs.

AB  - We have studied a cohort of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with smooth-muscle stroma (N=6), which lacked any of following genetic aberrations: mutations in the VHL-gene-coding sequence, loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3p, or hypermethylation of VHL. Using targeted next-generation sequencing, no intronic VHL mutations or mutations in selected genes involved in angiogenesis and genes frequently mutated in clear cell RCC were identified. Tumors were also tested for the presence of hotspot mutations in the TCEB1 gene with negative results in all cases. We conclude that there exists a group of RCCs with abundant leiomyomatous stroma, where the epithelial component is indistinguishable from conventional clear cell RCC and distinct from clear cell (tubulo-) papillary RCC and that these tumors lack aberrations related to the function of the VHL gene, mutations in genes involved in angiogenesis, and hotspot mutations in the TCEB1 gene.

AB  - Hypoxia is a condition always present in tumor environment owing to the fast growth of tumor cells not supported by adequate blood supply. There is increasing evidence that hypoxia plays an important role in cancer dormancy and cancer metabolism, increasing stemness activity and bringing about cancer initiation and progression. This condition may influence the production of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) a helix transcription factor which is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor growth through the regulation of genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolytic metabolism and other biological mechanisms. In normoxia condition HIF is inactivated by prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (EGLN 1-3, also known as PHD 1-3) using oxygen as a substrate. Once hydroxilated it binds to a protein called Von Hippel Lindau protein (VHL) for its degradation, whereas in hypoxia condition stabilization and nuclear translocation occur, leading to oncogenes activation. It has got three isoforms HIF-1 HIF-2 and HIF-3. The most studied factor is HIF-1 which is a heterodimer consisting of two forms, the form alpha is expressed in manner oxygen dependent, the form beta is expressed constitutively. Its presence in tumor microenvironment could foster among other the expression of VEGF, HGF, Met protoncogene which induces degradation of the extracellular matrix and TWIST gene, which is in turn involved in a mechanism of cancer cell metastasis called epithelial-mesenchimal transition(EMT). In this review, we summarize the most important findings in HIF action in different types of cancer focusing on its properties to induce tumor cell growth and highlighting its poor prognostic value in different cancers sites.

AB  - Precision therapy for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) requires molecular biomarkers ascertaining disease prognosis. In this study, we performed integrated proteomic and transcriptomic screening in all four tumour-node-metastasis stages of ccRCC and adjacent normal tissues (n = 18) to investigate differentially expressed genes. Most identified differentially expressed genes revealed a strong association with transforming growth factor-beta level and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process. Of them, Serpin peptidase inhibitor clade H member 1 (SERPINH1) revealed the strongest association with poor prognosis and regulation on the expression levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Subsequently, two independent sets (n = 532 and 105) verified the high level of SERPINH1 in ccRCC tissues and its association with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in all tumour-node-metastasis stages and patients with von Hippel-Lindau wild-type (VHL-WT). SERPINH1 was an independent predictor of poor overall survival (hazard ratio 0.696 for all patients) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.433 for all patients and 0.362 for patients with VHL-WT) in ccRCC. We have thus shown for the first time that SERPINH1 is an independent precision predictor for unfavourable prognosis in ccRCC. This could assist in identifying patients who need early aggressive management and deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of VHL-WT ccRCC.

AB  - Aims: The purpose of the present research is to investigate the effects of the VHL protein antagonist, VH298, on functional activities of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells and the effects on the wound healing process in a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemic rat model.
Methods: HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha protein levels in VH298-treated rat fibroblasts (rFb) were measured by immunoblotting, rFb proliferation was detected by the CCK-8 assay, and mRNA levels of related genes were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. In vitro wound healing was simulated by the scratch test; angiogenesis was measured by the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (hUVEC) tube formation assay. VH298 or PBS was locally injected into wounds in rat models with streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced hyperglycaemia, the wound tissues were harvested, and haematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson trichrome staining and immunohistochemical processes were conducted.
Results: HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha levels increased in VH298-treated rFb, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Thirty micromolar VH298 could significantly increase cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and gene expression of type I collagen-alpha1 (Col1-alpha1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The VH298-treated wound had a better healing pattern, activation of HIF-1 signalling, and vascularization.
Conclusions: Taken together, VH298 activated the HIF-1 signalling pathway by stabilizing both HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha. VH298 enhanced rFb functions, promoted hUVEC angiogenesis, and accelerated wound healing in the rat model mimicking diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Enthesis is the region where a tendon attaches to a bone. It is a relatively vulnerable position, and in most cases surgical treatment is required upon rupture. The reconstructed enthesis is usually weaker compared to the original, and is prone to rupture again. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) is known to be involved in extensive activities in cells. It is inhibited under normoxic conditions, and undergoes two essential processes, hydroxylation and ubiquitination, the latter of which has been largely unexplored. Herein, we measured the levels of HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha in VH298-treated rat tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) by immunoblotting. We also detected the proliferation of TDSCs using CCK-8 assay and the mRNA levels of related genes by quantitative RT-PCR. The TDSCs were observed to be induced and the chondrogenic differentiation related genes were found to be enhanced. We also simulated in-vitro wounding in a scratch test and reconstructed the enthesis in a rat model of Achilles tendon by classical surgery followed by administration of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection or VH298 injection. We observed that HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha levels were increased in VH298-treated TDSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Thirty micromolar VH298 could significantly increase cell proliferation, migration, and expression of collagen-1alpha, collagen-3alpha, decorin, tenomodulin, tenascin C genes, and chondrogenic differentiation-related genes, collagen-2alpha, SRY-box9, aggrecan. VH298-treated enthesis could tolerate more load-to-failure, had a better healing pattern, and activation of HIF signaling pathway. VH298 can thus enhance the functional activities of TDSCs, enhance their chondrogenic differentiation potential, and accelerate enthesis healing by inhibiting the ubiquitination of hydroxy-HIF-1alpha.

AB  - Hypoxia is an important contributor to aggressive behavior and resistance mechanisms in glioblastoma. Upregulation of hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs) is the primary adaptive cellular response to a hypoxic environment. While HIF1alpha has been widely studied in cancer, HIF2alpha offers a potentially more specific and appealing target in glioblastoma given expression in glioma stem cells and not normal neural progenitors, activation in states of chronic hypoxia and expression that correlates with glioma patient survival. A first-in-class HIF2alpha inhibitor, PT2385, is in clinical trials for renal cell carcinoma, and provides the first opportunity to therapeutically target this important pathway in glioma biology.

AB  - In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene and reduced oxygen tension promote stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors, which promote changes in the expression of genes that contribute to oncogenesis. Multiple studies have demonstrated significant perturbations in DNA methylation in ccRCC via largely unclear mechanisms that modify the transcriptional output of tumour cells. Here, we show that the methylation status of the CpG dinucleotide within the consensus hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) markedly influences the binding of HIF and that the loss of VHL results in significant alterations in the DNA methylome. Surprisingly, hypoxia, which likewise promotes HIF stabilisation and activation, has relatively few effects on global DNA methylation. Gene expression analysis of ccRCC patient samples highlighted expression of a group of genes whose transcription correlated with methylation changes, including hypoxic responsive genes such as VEGF and TGF. These results suggest that the loss of VHL alters DNA methylation profile across the genome, commonly associated with and contributing to ccRCC progression.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by a high risk of developing benign and malignant tumors, including central nervous system hemangioblastomas (CNS HBs). For an early diagnosis of VHL, before the occurrence of cancers (especially renal cell carcinoma), it is of huge importance to initiate VHL genetic testing in at-risk patients. The aim of the study was to assess the psychological impact of VHL genetic testing in patients previously diagnosed with a CNS HB. From 1999 until 2015, 55 patients underwent surgery for CNS HBs. Eleven patients were already screened for VHL mutations and 3 patients deceased before the start of the study. From the remaining 42 patients, 24 were accepted to be enrolled in the study. Assessment of psychological impact of VHL genetic testing was performed by measuring anxiety levels, mood disorders, quality of life, and psychological consequences of genetic screening. Twenty-one of the enrolled 24 patients underwent VHL genetic testing and 12 patients came back for the communication of positive genetic results. The baseline psychological status did not differ between these 2 groups. Patients who attended the visit of communication of genetic results had similar anxiety levels compared to those who had not. Furthermore, they also experienced an improvement in the level of anxiety and two QoL dimension scores compared to their baseline status. In summary, there is no evidence of a negative psychosocial impact of VHL genetic testing in patients with a previous history of CNS HB. We, therefore, recommend the recall of patients who have not been previously screened.

AB  - Background: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare but potentially harmful tumors that can vary in their clinical presentation. Tumors may be found due to signs and symptoms, as part of a hereditary syndrome or following an imaging procedure. Objective(s): To investigate potential differences in clinical presentation between PPGLs discovered by imaging (iPPGLs), symptomatic cases (sPPGLs) and those diagnosed during follow-up because of earlier disease/known hereditary mutations (fPPGL). Design(s): Prospective study protocol, which has enrolled patients from six European centers with confirmed PPGLs. Data were analyzed from 235 patients (37 iPPGLs, 36 sPPGLs, 27% fPPGLs) and compared for tumor volume, biochemical profile, mutation status, presence of metastases and self-reported symptoms. iPPGL patients were diagnosed at a significantly higher age than fPPGLs (P < 0.001), found to have larger tumors (P = 0.003) and higher metanephrine and normetanephrine levels at diagnosis (P = 0.021). Significantly lower than in sPPGL, there was a relevant number of selfreported symptoms in iPPGL (2.9 vs 4.3 symptoms, P < 0.001). In 16.2% of iPPGL, mutations in susceptibility genes were detected, although this proportion was lower than that in fPPGL (60.9%) and sPPGL (21.5%). Patients with PPGLs detected by imaging were older, have higher tumor volume and more excessive hormonal secretion in comparison to those found as part of a surveillance program. Presence of typical symptoms indicates that in a relevant proportion of those patients, the PPGL diagnosis had been delayed. Precis: Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma discovered by imaging are often symptomatic and carry a significant proportion of germline mutations in susceptibility genes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Germline mutations are present in 20-30 per cent of patients with phaeochromocytoma. For patients who develop bilateral disease, complete removal of both adrenal glands (total adrenalectomy) will result in lifelong adrenal insufficiency with an increased risk of death from adrenal crisis. Unilateral/bilateral adrenal-sparing surgery (subtotal adrenalectomy) offers preservation of cortical function and independence from steroids, but leaves the adrenal medulla in situ and thus at risk of developing new and possibly malignant disease. Here, present knowledge about how tumour genotype relates to clinical behaviour is reviewed, and application of this knowledge when choosing the extent of adrenalectomy is discussed.
METHODS: A literature review was undertaken of the penetrance of the different genotypes in phaeochromocytomas, the frequency of bilateral disease and malignancy, and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, with emphasis on explaining the clinical phenotypes of phaeochromocytomas and their associated syndromes.
RESULTS: Patients with bilateral phaeochromocytomas most often have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) with high-penetrance mutations for benign disease, whereas patients with mutations in the genes encoding SDHB (succinate dehydrogenase subunit B) or MAX (myelocytomatosis viral proto-oncogene homologue-associated factor X) are at increased risk of malignancy.
CONCLUSION: Adrenal-sparing surgery should be the standard approach for patients who have already been diagnosed with MEN2 or VHL when operating on the first side, whereas complete removal of the affected adrenal gland(s) is generally recommended for patients with SDHB or MAX germline mutations. Routine assessment of a patient's genotype, even after the first operation, can be crucial for adopting an appropriate strategy for follow-up and future surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignancy commonly encountered by both clinicians and pathologists. Different RCC subtypes are classified based on histologic features, immunohistochemistry profiles, and cytogenetic abnormalities. Accurate diagnosis of subtypes is important as it has prognostic and therapeutic implications. The most common RCC subtype is clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC); the most frequent genetic abnormalities associated with CCRCC are a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 involving 3p21 and mutations involving the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Advances in molecular pathology have identified additional molecular pathways leading to CCRCC. Researchers identified mutations of TCEB-1, monosomy 8, intact chromosome 3 and lack of VHL gene mutations in 4.7% of CCRCC. Additional evidence has been found recognizing RCC with monosomy 8 as a unique RCC subtype by describing cases with similar genetic profiles, non-specific immunohistochemistry, and histomorphology that overlapped with other known RCC types. At the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC), conventional cytogenetics are obtained on all renal neoplasms. Three recent cases of RCC with monosomy 8, normal chromosome 3 morphology, clear cell cytology and non-specific immunohistochemistry profiles were identified. We present these cases to further document this unique subtype and highlight the importance of conventional cytogenetics in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma.

AB  - Renal cell cancer (RCC) has become a prototype example of the extensive intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution of human cancers. However, there is little direct evidence on how the genetic heterogeneity impacts on drug response profiles of the cancer cells. Our goal was to determine how genomic clonal evolution impacts drug responses. Finding from our study could help to define the challenge that clonal evolution poses on cancer therapy. We established multiple patient-derived cells (PDCs) from different tumor regions of four RCC patients, verified their clonal relationship to each other and to the uncultured tumor tissue by genome sequencing. Furthermore, comprehensive drug-sensitivity testing with 460 oncological drugs was performed on all PDC clones. The PDCs retained many cancer-specific copy number alterations and mutations in driver genes such as VHL, PBRM1, PIK3C2A, KMD5C and TSC2 genes. The drug testing highlighted vulnerability in the PDCs toward approved RCC drugs, such as the mTOR-inhibitor temsirolimus, but also novel sensitivities were uncovered. The individual PDC clones from different tumor regions in a patient showed distinct drug-response profiles, suggesting that genomic heterogeneity contributes to the variability in drug responses. Studies of multiple PDCs from a patient with cancer are informative for elucidating cancer heterogeneity and for the determination on how the genomic evolution is manifested in cancer drug responsiveness. This approach could facilitate tailoring of drugs and drug combinations to individual patients. Copyright © 2018 UICC

AB  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in the vast majority of human clear cell renal carcinomas. The pathogenesis of VHL loss is currently best understood to occur through stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factors, activation of hypoxia-induced signaling pathways, and transcriptional reprogramming towards a pro-angiogenic and pro-growth state. However, hypoxia also drives other pro-tumorigenic processes, including the development of genomic instability via down-regulation of DNA repair gene expression. Here, we find that DNA repair genes involved in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR) and in mismatch repair, which are down-regulated by hypoxic stress, are decreased in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells relative to wild type VHL-complemented cells. Functionally, this gene repression is associated with impaired DNA double-strand break repair in VHL-deficient cells, as determined by the persistence of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and reduced repair activity in a homology-dependent plasmid reactivation assay. Furthermore, VHL deficiency conferred increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, analogous to the synthetic lethality observed between hypoxia and these agents. Finally, we discovered a correlation between VHL inactivation and reduced HR gene expression in a large panel of human renal carcinoma samples. Together, our data elucidate a novel connection between VHL-deficient renal carcinoma and hypoxia-induced down-regulation of DNA repair, and identify potential opportunities for targeting DNA repair defects in human renal cell carcinoma.

AB  - Targeting the "undruggable" proteome remains one of the big challenges in drug discovery. Recent innovations in the field of targeted protein degradation and manipulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system open up new therapeutic approaches for disorders that cannot be targeted with conventional inhibitor paradigms. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bivalent ligands in which a compound that binds to the protein target of interest is connected to a second molecule that binds an E3 ligase via a linker. The E3 protein is usually either Cereblon or Von Hippel-Lindau. Several examples of selective PROTAC molecules with potent effect in cells and in vivo models have been reported. The degradation of specific proteins via these bivalent molecules is already allowing for the study of biochemical pathways and cell biology with more specificity than was possible with inhibitor compounds. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the field of small molecule mediated protein degradation, including transcription factors, kinases and nuclear receptors. We discuss the potential benefits of protein degradation over inhibition as well as the challenges that need to be overcome.

AB  - Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) control transcriptional responses to reduced O<sub>2</sub> availability. HIFs are heterodimeric proteins composed of an O<sub>2</sub>-regulated HIF-alpha subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1beta subunit. HIF-alpha subunits are subject to prolyl hydroxylation, which targets the proteins for degradation under normoxic conditions. Small molecule prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which stabilize the HIF-alpha subunits and increase HIF-dependent expression of erythropoietin, are in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. HIFs contribute to the pathogenesis of many cancers, particularly the clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma in which loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor blocks HIF-2alpha degradation. A small molecule inhibitor that binds to HIF-2alpha and blocks dimerization with HIF-1beta is in clinical trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Targeting HIFs for stabilization or inhibition may improve outcomes in diseases that are common causes of mortality in the US population.

AB  - Renal cancer is the major cause of mortality due to abnormal functioning of von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) and Jade Family PHD Finger 1 (JADE1) complex. E3 ubiquitin ligase JADE1 is stabilized by pVHL interaction through its plant homeodomains (PHDs). JADE1 acts as a renal tumor suppressor that promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of beta-catenin by inhibiting canonical WNT signalling. Current study focuses on the structural characterization of reported missense mutations in pVHL through in silico approaches. The predicted 3-dimensional structures of pVHL<sup>WT</sup>, pVHL<sup>Y98H</sup>, pVHL<sup>Y112H</sup>, pVHL<sup>L118P</sup> and pVHL<sup>R167W</sup> were subjected to binding analysis against JADE1 through molecular docking and simulation assays. In all cases, JADE1 binding was observed at the beta-domain, except pVHL<sup>L118P</sup> that exhibited binding with JADE1 through its alpha-domain. Our results signify that JADE1 stabilization is induced by pVHL alpha-domain, while beta-domain is required for JADE1 binding. pVHL binding was mediated through beta1 and beta2-strands against the concave surface of the JADE1-PHD domain. The pVHL-JADE1 complex was evaluated to scrutinize the beta-catenin-binding interface, which suggested the contribution of both alpha and beta-domains of pVHL in beta-catenin binding. The eleven-residue (Tyr30-Thr40) beta-catenin segment exhibited association in a bipartite manner with pVHL-JADE1 complex. The presented model depicts a pVHL-JADE1 interface for the cooperative regulation of beta-catenin binding. We propose that reduced JADE1 stabilization in case of pVHL<sup>L118P</sup> and pVHL<sup>R167W</sup> may correlate with the increased activity of beta-catenin that may lead to renal cancer through beta-catenin de-repression. Overall, beta-catenin targeting mechanism coupled with the structural knowledge of JADE1-pVHL complex will provide better understanding of renal cancer pathogenesis.

AB  - The majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are caused by an accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and the overexpression of downstream genes in response to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene becoming inactivated. In the present study, our hypothesis was that BNIP3, a gene positioned downstream of HIF, would be expressed at a higher level in ccRCC; however, instead, lower levels of BNIP3 expression were identified in RCC tumor tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. These changes were associated with lower levels of VHL, and higher levels of HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor. BNIP3 was also undetectable in three investigated RCC cell lines (786-O, ACHN, A498) and GRC-1-1 cells. Methylation of the BNIP3 promoter was not detected, and neither did treatment with a methylation inhibitor cause cell proliferation. However, treatment with a histone deacetylation inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), inhibited cultured RCC cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis and restored BNIP3 expression. Furthermore, histone deacetylation of the BNIP3 promoter was identified in ACHN and 786-O cells, and the acetylation status was restored following TSA treatment. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that histone deacetylation, but not methylation, is most likely to cause BNIP3 inactivation in RCC. The data also indicated that restoration of BNIP3 expression by a histone deacetylation inhibitor led to growth inhibition and apoptotic promotion in RCC.

AB  - Clear cell variant of epithelioid mesothelioma is an extremely rare tumor with only isolated cases reported so far in the peritoneum. Here, we report a case of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma, clear cell variant, in a 63-year-old female patient with a novel VHL gene mutation and an unusual indolent clinical course. The patient, who has no clinical history of asbestos exposure, presented with a 27.2-cm upper abdominal mass and a 5.5-cm liver lesion. Retrospective review of the patient's abdominal computed tomographic scan 4 years ago showed 2 small abdominal lesions that were felt clinically to represent hemangiomas. These were retrospectively considered to have grown in size and represented the current abdominal mass. Both masses were subsequently biopsied and showed a proliferation of monomorphic epithelioid cells with distinct cell membranes, fine chromatin, and clear to finely vacuolated pale eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in nests and solid sheets. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed it to be malignant mesothelioma. Clear cell variant of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma should always be considered in patients with an abdominal or pelvic mass with clear cell features. Given the rarity of such entity, its clinical course and prognosis remains unclear. Copyright © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Tibetans have been living at altitudes over 3500 m for ~20,000 years and have developed unique beneficial evolutionary genetic adaptions (PMID:28448578). Our previous study identified selected genetic haplotypes in two genes, EPAS1 (encoding hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha [HIF2-a], a transcription factor that mediates the hypoxic response), and EGLN1 (encoding prolyl hydroxylase 2 [PHD2], a principal negative regulator of HIF stability (PMID:251 291 47). The presence of these two haplotypes correlates with lower hemoglobin levels in Tibetans compared to other highlanders. However, the entire diverse complex of molecular mechanisms of high altitude adaptation is still largely unknown and our study showed that neither EPAS1 nor EGLN1 variants fully explain the mechanism of protection from polycythemia in Tibetans in high altitude (PMID:28233034). We found an enriched haplotype in the PKLR gene (encoding pyruvate kinase [PK] expressed only in liver and red blood cells). The PK enzyme is in the terminal portion of the glycolytic pathway, and its decreased activity leads to accumulation of proximal glycolytic intermediates, including 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) which shifts the hemoglobin dissociation curve to right (high p50) and increases oxygen release to tissues from a unit of hemoglobin. We hypothesized that Tibetan enriched PKLR variants might improve oxygen delivery to tissues and help explain the protection from polycythemia at high altitude. Genomic analyses revealed that this PKLR haplotype is enriched in Tibetans but is not unique to Tibetans. It has the highest frequency in Tibetans (89%), with a lower prevalence in Chinese and Mongolians (~77%), Kyrgyz (~60 %), Aymara (~44 %), and Colombians (~30 %) and a much lower frequency in Caucasians (11%), perhaps explaining the heterogeneity of responses to hypoxia within and among these populations. Our study of reticulocyte RNA showed that transcript levels of PKLR progressively decrease with increasing altitude in controls and even more in Tibetans with the Tibetan evolutionary selected PKLR haplotype. Tibetans with the PKLR haplotype (heterozygotes and homozygotes) have lower PKLR transcript levels than wild type Tibetans. Because of the paucity of wildtype PKLR haplotype in Tibetans and the challenges of acquiring Tibetan samples in high altitude in China, we collected samples from 1 25 m (Cheboksary, Chuvashia); 800 m (Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan) and 2640 m (Bogota, Colombia). PK activity, PKLR transcript levels, and ATP decreased at 2640 m compared to 800 m, while p50 increased at 2640 m. PKLR transcript levels correlated with PK activity and ATP and inversely correlated with p50. PK activities also correlated with PKLR transcript levels and ATP and inversely correlated with p50. At 2640 m, PK activity was lower and p50 levels were higher in those with the enriched PKLR haplotype. These results demonstrate that increasing altitude decreases PK activity, resulting in increasing p50 providing a molecular basis for the previously reported improvement of oxygen delivery at high altitude (PMID:1 739441 5). To study the roles of HIFs in the regulation of PKLR gene expression, we also collected samples from Chuvash polycythemia (CP) homozygotes and Chuvash controls. CP homozygotes have a mutation in the VHL gene, a negative regulator of HIFs, that results in augmented HIF levels. CP homozygotes had lower PKLR mRNA in reticulocytes, PK activity, and PKR protein levels in red blood cells compared to controls, while their 2,3 DPG levels were higher. These data confirm that PKLR expression levels are negatively regulated by HIFs. Our findings demonstrate that individuals in high altitudes have lower PKLR transcript levels and PK activity, resulting in high 2,3DPG and p shifts the hemoglobin dissociation curve to right. This decreases affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, which improves tissue oxygen delivery and as such is another mechanism in Tibetans that protects from high altitude polycythemia. We also demonstrate that HIFs negatively regulate PKLR expression, leading to b tter oxygen release from hemoglobin at high altitude.

AB  - A line of studies strongly suggest that the intravenous anesthetic, propofol, suppresses mitochondrial oxygen metabolism. It is also indicated that propofol induces the cell death in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor which is involved in cellular metabolic reprogramming by modulating gene expressions of enzymes including glycolysis pathway and oxygen utilization of mitochondria, we examined the functional role of HIF-1 activity in propofol-induced cell death. The role of HIF-1 activity on oxygen and energy metabolisms and propofol-induced cell death and caspase activity was examined in renal cell-derived RCC4 cells: RCC4-EV cells which lack von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) protein expression and RCC4-VHL cells, which express exogenous VHL, and in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. It was demonstrated that HIF-1 is involved in suppressing oxygen consumption and facilitating glycolysis in cells and that the resistance to propofol-induced cell death was established in a HIF-1 activation-dependent manner. It was also demonstrated that HIF-1 activation by treatment with HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors such as n-propyl gallate and dimethyloxaloylglycine, alleviated the toxic effects of propofol. Thus, the resistance to propofol toxicity was conferred by HIF-1 activation by not only genetic deletion of VHL but also exposure to HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors.

AB  - Aim: BAP1 is frequently mutated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with a definitive role still unclear. Method(s): In silico analysis of BAP1-mutant and wild-type gene enrichment and functional annotation in TCGA-KIRC dataset was performed. Target gene was studied based on functional clustering and was knowledge-based. Validation using in-house pathological sections were performed immunohistochemically. In vitro and in vivo studies on target gene were performed. Result(s): The TCGA ccRCC dataset included 534 ccRCC samples. BAP1 was frequently mutated and more frequently downregulated in ccRCC compared to normal kidney tissue or benign renal tumors. In the analysis between samples with BAP1 mutation (N = 33) and pan-negative (N = 33), we found that cancers with BAP1 mutation was significantly enriched for 14 pathways, of which 3 were DNA repair pathways, in which EZH2 played a role. CcRCC patients with lower BAP1 expression had poor prognosis and showed higher EZH2 expression, which also conferred worsened survival. Genetic and pharmaceutical inhibition of EZH2 not only inhibited BAP1-mutatn ccRCC cell viability and invasion but also abrogated genetic replenishing of BAP1 expression. Validation cohort encompassing 62 ccRCC samples confirmed the worsened phenotype for cases with higher EZH2 expression and significant positive correlation between expressions of EZH2 and BAP1. EZH2 inhibitor also inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse model with BAP1-mutated ccRCC cells with unremarkable toxicity. Conclusion(s): CcRCC with decreased BAP1 level has poor prognosis and is associated with higher EZH2 expression. Inhibition of EZH2 in BAP1-mutated entity holds promise for further investigation.

AB  - Disruption of the daily (i.e., circadian) rhythms of cell metabolism, proliferation and blood perfusion is a hallmark of many cancer types, perhaps most clearly exemplified by the rare but detrimental pheochromocytomas. These tumors arise from genetic disruption of genes critical for hypoxia signaling, such as von Hippel-Lindau and hypoxia-inducible factor-2 or cellular metabolism, such as succinate dehydrogenase, which in turn impacts on the cellular circadian clock function by interfering with the Bmal1 and/or Clock transcription factors. While pheochromocytomas are often non-malignant, the resulting changes in cellular physiology are coupled to de-regulated production of catecholamines, which in turn disrupt circadian blood pressure variation and therefore circadian entrainment of other tissues. In this review we thoroughly discuss the molecular and physiological interplay between hypoxia signaling and the circadian clock in pheochromocytoma, and how this underlies endocrine disruption leading to loss of circadian blood pressure variation in the affected patients. We furthermore discuss potential avenues for targeting these tumor-specific pathophysiological mechanisms therapeutically in the future.

AB  - It is definitively established that mutations in transcription factor HIF-2alpha are causative of both neuroendocrine tumors (class 1 disease) and polycythemia (class 2 disease). However, the molecular mechanism that underlies this emergent genotype-phenotype relationship has remained unclear. Here, we report the structure of HIF-2alpha peptide bound to pVHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) heterotrimeric complex, which shows topographical demarcation of class 1 and 2 mutations affecting residues predicted, and demonstrated via biophysical analyses, to differentially impact HIF-2alpha-pVHL interaction interface stability. Concordantly, biochemical experiments showed that class 1 mutations disrupt pVHL affinity to HIF-2alpha more adversely than class 2 mutations directly or indirectly via impeding PHD2-mediated hydroxylation. These findings suggest that neuroendocrine tumor pathogenesis requires a higher HIF-2alpha dose than polycythemia, which requires only a mild increase in HIF-2alpha activity. These biophysical data reveal a structural basis that underlies, and can be used to predict de novo, broad genotype-phenotype correlations in HIF-2alpha-driven disease.

AB  - Exposure to hypoxia elicits a myriad of adaptive responses that are mediated by hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). An essential physiologic response to hypoxia is increase of production of erythrocytes necessary to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues; it has also been reported that the survival of erythrocyte may increase. Congenital defects of upregulation of the hypoxia-sensing pathway result in inappropriately elevated erythrocyte concentration. Evolutionarily, after many generations of living at high altitude, high altitude dwellers such as Tibetans, Andeans, and Ethiopians have selected genomic signatures, some in HIF pathway, enabling them to prosper in high altitude hypoxic environment. However, the entire diverse complex of molecular mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation is still largely unknown. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the major cause of death among patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Resistance to therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis opens the question about the underlying mechanisms. Previously we have described that RWDD3 or RSUME (RWD domain-containing protein SUMO Enhancer) sumoylates and binds VHL protein and negatively regulates HIF degradation, leading to xenograft RCC tumor growth in mice. In this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis in a ccRCC dataset showing an association of RSUME levels with VHL mutations and tumor progression, and we demonstrate the molecular mechanism by which RSUME regulates the pathologic angiogenic phenotype of VHL missense mutations. We report that VHL mutants fail to downregulate RSUME protein levels accounting for the increased RSUME expression found in RCC tumors. Furthermore, we prove that targeting RSUME in RCC cell line clones carrying missense VHL mutants results in decreased early tumor angiogenesis. The mechanism we describe is that RSUME sumoylates VHL mutants and beyond its sumoylation capacity, interacts with Type 2 VHL mutants, reduces HIF-2alpha-VHL mutants binding, and negatively regulates the assembly of the Type 2 VHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV) complex. Altogether these results show RSUME involvement in VHL mutants deregulation that leads to the angiogenic phenotype of RCC tumors.

AB  - The phakomatoses, encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis (ETA; Sturge-Weber Syndrome), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 or von Recklinghausen disease), Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC), oculodermal melanocytosis (ODM), and phakomatosis pigmentovascularis are a group of neurocutaneous disorders that have characteristic systemic and ocular manifestations. Through many different mechanisms, they may cause glaucomatous damage of the optic nerve and subsequent vision loss varying from mild to severe. Glaucoma commonly affects patients with ETA (43-72%), orbito-facial NF1 (23-50%), and ODM (10%). Rarely, it may present as neovascular glaucoma in VHL and TSC. In ETA, glaucoma typically occurs ipsilateral to the port-wine stain, which is caused by a mutation in the GNAQ gene. Specifically, mechanical malformation of the anterior chamber angle and elevated episcleral venous pressure has been implicated as causes of glaucoma in ETA. In NF1, which is caused by a mutation in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, glaucoma commonly occurs ipsilateral to lid plexiform neurofibromas. Histological studies of eyes with NF1 have revealed direct anterior chamber infiltration by neurofibromas, secondary angle closure, fibrovascularization, and developmental angle abnormalities as mechanisms of glaucoma. Lastly, phakomatosis pigmentovascularis is a rare combination of ODM and port-wine stain. Affected patients are at very high risk of developing glaucoma. Despite the many different mechanisms of glaucomatous damage, management follows similar principles as that for congenital glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma. First-line therapy is topical intraocular pressure-lowering eye drops. Surgical management, including goniotomy, trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, and tube shunt placement may be required for more severe cases.

AB  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) is a devastating disease with limited therapeutic options available for advanced stages. The objective of this study was to investigate HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, as potential therapeutics for CC-RCC. Importantly, treatment with statins was found to be synthetically lethal with the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which occurs in 90% of CC-RCC driving the disease. This effect has been confirmed in three different CC-RCC cell lines with three different lipophilic statins. Inhibition of mevalonate synthesis by statins causes a profound cytostatic effect at nanomolar concentrations and becomes cytotoxic at low micromolar concentrations in VHL-deficient CC-RCC. The synthetic lethal effect can be fully rescued by both mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not by squalene, indicating that the effect is due to disruption of small GTPase isoprenylation and not the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of Rho and Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling contributes to the synthetic lethality effect, and overactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor signaling resulting from VHL loss is required. Finally, statin treatment is able to inhibit both tumor initiation and progression of subcutaneous 786-OT1-based CC-RCC tumors in mice. Thus, statins represent potential therapeutics for the treatment of VHL-deficient CC-RCC. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(8); 1781-92. ©2018 AACR.

AB  - Endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs) are rare, slowly growing temporal bone neoplasms which show a high association with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. The immunohistochemistry evaluation of these papillary-cystic neoplasms frequently raises the differential diagnosis with renal cell carcinoma, among other metastatic neoplasms, whether in VHL patients or not. A cohort of 26 patients with ELSTs were evaluated for histologic features, immunohistochemistry findings, and association with VHL. Standard immunohistochemistry evaluation was performed. Sixteen females and 10 males ranging in age from 10 to 69 years (mean 44; VHL mean: 32) at initial presentation, comprised the cohort of patients. Most (86%) experienced hearing changes or inner ear symptoms (vertigo, dizziness), with an average duration of symptoms for 39 months (range 2-240 months). The tumors were an average of 2.9 cm (range 0.4-8 cm), with 14 left, 11 right sided and one bilateral tumor. Nine patients had documented VHL, with 3 patients having a concurrent or subsequent clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Patients were followed an average of 6.2 years (available in 24 patients): 19 alive without disease, 7.5 years; 2 dead without disease, 1.2 years; and 3 alive with disease, 3.1 years. The neoplastic cells show the following immunohistochemistry findings: AE1/AE3, EMA, CK7, CAIX, GLUT1, VEGF: 100% of cases tested were positive; pax-8: 85% of cases positive; CD10 and RCC: 0% of cases reactive. Based on this cohort of 26 patients with ELST, 9 of whom had VHL, the strong pax-8 and CAIX should be used in conjunction with negative CD10 and RCC to help exclude a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. As CAIX is an enzyme overexpressed in hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factor is what VHL protein regulates, this is an expected, although previously unreported finding. Whether part of VHL or not, VHL mutations may be a somatic rather than germline finding in the tumors, a possible further explanation for the CAIX reaction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation is a known cause of cancer initiation and/or progression. There are scant data on the genome-wide methylation pattern of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NFPanNETs) and sporadic and hereditary NFPanNETs.
METHODS: Thirty-three tissue samples were analyzed: they included samples from sporadic (n = 9), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-related (n = 10), and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)-related NFPanNETs (n = 10) as well as normal islet cells (n = 4) for comparison. Genome-wide CpG methylation profiling was performed with the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay and was analyzed with R-based tools.
RESULTS: In unsupervised hierarchical clustering, sporadic and MEN1-related NFPanNETs clustered together, and the VHL group was in a separate cluster. MEN1-related NFPanNETs had a higher rate of hypermethylated CpG sites in comparison with sporadic and VHL-related tumor groups. Differentially methylated region analysis confirmed the higher rate of hypermethylation in MEN1-related tumors. Moreover, in an integrated analysis of gene expression data for the same tumor samples, downregulated gene expression was found in most genes that were hypermethylated. In a CpG island methylator phenotype analysis, 3 genes were identified and confirmed to have downregulated gene expression: secreted frizzle-related protein 5 (SFRP5) in sporadic NFPanNETs and cell division cycle-associated 7-like (CDCA7L) and RNA binding motif 47 (RBM47) in MEN1-related NFPanNETs.
CONCLUSIONS: MEN1 NFPanNETs have a higher rate of geno me-wide hypermethylation than other NFPanNET subtypes. The similarity between the pathways enriched in a methylation analysis of known genes involved in NFPanNET tumorigenesis suggests a key role for aberrant methylation in the pathogenesis of NFPanNETs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence demonstrated that restoration of wild type VHL in human renal cancer cells decreased in vitro NK susceptibility. To investigate on the role of tumoral VHL status versus NK capability in renal cancer patients, 51 RCC patients were characterized for VHL mutational status and NK function.
METHODS: VHL mutational status was determined by direct DNA sequencing on tumor tissue. NK cytotoxicity was measured against specific target cells K562, VHL-wild type (CAKI-1) and VHL-mutated (A498) human renal cancer cells through externalization of CD107a and IFN-gamma production. Activating NK receptors, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, DNAM-1, NCAM-1 and FcgammaRIIIa were evaluated through quantitative RT-PCR. RCC tumoral Tregs were characterized as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> and Treg function was evaluated as inhibition of T-effector proliferation.
RESULTS: VHL mutations were detected in 26/55 (47%) RCC patients. IL-2 activated whole-blood samples (28 VHL-WT-RCC and 23 VHL-MUT-RCC) were evaluated for NK cytotoxicity toward human renal cancer cells A498, VHL-MUT and CAKI-1, VHL-WT. Efficient NK degranulation and increase in IFN-gamma production was detected when IL-2 activated whole-blood from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were tested toward A498 as compared to CAKI-1 cells (CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 7 +/- 2% vs 1 +/- 0.41%, p = 0.015; IFN-gamma<sup>+</sup>NK: 6.26 +/- 3.4% vs 1.78 +/- 0.9% respectively). In addition, IL-2 activated NKs induced higher CD107a exposure in the presence of RCC autologous tumor cells or A498 as compared to SN12C (average CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 4.7 and 2.7% vs 0.3% respectively at 10E:1 T ratio). VHL-MUT-RCC tumors were NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells infiltrated and expressed high NKp30 and NKp46 receptors as compared to VHL-WT-RCC tumors. A significant lower number of Tregs was detected in the tumor microenvironment of 13 VHL-MUT-RCC as compared to 13 VHL-WT-RCC tumors (1.84 +/- 0.36% vs 3.79 +/- 0.74% respectively, p = 0.04). Tregs isolated from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were less suppressive of patients T effector proliferation compared to Tregs from VHL-WT-RCC patients (Teff proliferation: 6.7 +/- 3.9% vs 2.8 +/- 1.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: VHL tumoral mutations improve NKs effectiveness in RCC patients and need to be considered in the evaluation of immune response. Moreover therapeutic strategies designed to target NK cells could be beneficial in VHL-mutated-RCCs alone or in association with immune checkpoints inhibitors.

AB  - Background: Previous evidence demonstrated that restoration of wild type VHL in human renal cancer cells decreased in vitro NK susceptibility. To investigate on the role of tumoral VHL status versus NK capability in renal cancer patients, 51 RCC patients were characterized for VHL mutational status and NK function. Method(s): VHL mutational status was determined by direct DNA sequencing on tumor tissue. NK cytotoxicity was measured against specific target cells K562, VHL-wild type (CAKI-1) and VHL-mutated (A498) human renal cancer cells through externalization of CD107a and IFN-gamma production. Activating NK receptors, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, DNAM-1, NCAM-1 and FcgammaRIIIa were evaluated through quantitative RT-PCR. RCC tumoral Tregs were characterized as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> and Treg function was evaluated as inhibition of T-effector proliferation. Result(s): VHL mutations were detected in 26/55 (47%) RCC patients. IL-2 activated whole-blood samples (28 VHL-WT-RCC and 23 VHL-MUT-RCC) were evaluated for NK cytotoxicity toward human renal cancer cells A498, VHL-MUT and CAKI-1, VHL-WT. Efficient NK degranulation and increase in IFN-gamma production was detected when IL-2 activated whole-blood from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were tested toward A498 as compared to CAKI-1 cells (CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 7 +/- 2% vs 1 +/- 0.41%, p = 0.015; IFN-gamma<sup>+</sup>NK: 6.26 +/- 3.4% vs 1.78 +/- 0.9% respectively). In addition, IL-2 activated NKs induced higher CD107a exposure in the presence of RCC autologous tumor cells or A498 as compared to SN12C (average CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 4.7 and 2.7% vs 0.3% respectively at 10E:1 T ratio). VHL-MUT-RCC tumors were NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells infiltrated and expressed high NKp30 and NKp46 receptors as compared to VHL-WT-RCC tumors. A significant lower number of Tregs was detected in the tumor microenvironment of 13 VHL-MUT-RCC as compared to 13 VHL-WT-RCC tumors (1.84 +/- 0.36% vs 3.79 +/- 0.74% respectively, p = 0.04). Tregs isolated from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were less suppressive of patients T effector proliferation compared to Tregs from VHL-WT-RCC patients (Teff proliferation: 6.7 +/- 3.9% vs 2.8 +/- 1.1%). Conclusion(s): VHL tumoral mutations improve NKs effectiveness in RCC patients and need to be considered in the evaluation of immune response. Moreover therapeutic strategies designed to target NK cells could be beneficial in VHL-mutated-RCCs alone or in association with immune checkpoints inhibitors. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: We investigated the frequencies and characteristics of intragenic copy-number variants (CNVs) in a deep sampling of disease genes associated with monogenic disorders. Method(s): Subsets of 1507 genes were tested using next-generation sequencing to simultaneously detect sequence variants and CNVs in >143,000 individuals referred for genetic testing. We analyzed CNVs in gene panels for hereditary cancer syndromes and cardiovascular, neurological, or pediatric disorders. Result(s): Our analysis identified 2844 intragenic CNVs in 384 clinically tested genes. CNVs were observed in 1.9% of the entire cohort but in a disproportionately high fraction (9.8%) of individuals with a clinically significant result. CNVs accounted for 4.7-35% of pathogenic variants, depending on clinical specialty. Distinct patterns existed among CNVs in terms of copy number, location, exons affected, clinical classification, and genes affected. Separately, analysis of de-identified data for 599 genes unrelated to the clinical phenotype yielded 4054 CNVs. Most of these CNVs were novel rare events, present as duplications, and enriched in genes associated with recessive disorders or lacking loss-of-function mutational mechanisms. Conclusion(s): Universal intragenic CNV analysis adds substantial clinical sensitivity to genetic testing. Clinically relevant CNVs have distinct properties that distinguish them from CNVs contributing to normal variation in human disease genes. Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are tumors that arise from related neurally-derived cells of the autonomic nervous system. The World Health Organization classification of endocrine tumors arbitrarily reserves the name pheochromocytoma for tumors that arise from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Paragangliomas are similar tumors that occur throughout the distribution of sympathetic nerves and ganglia and along branches of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves in the head and neck. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas may be morphologically and functionally identical or may show functional differences associated with different anatomic sites. Recent molecular and genetic advances have led to greatly increased understanding of these tumors. It is now known that as many as 30% are hereditary. While some of the hereditary disorders, including von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), MEN2, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), have been well recognized for decades, recent discoveries have put a new focus on enzymes within the Krebs cycle, especially the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes. Pathogenic germline mutations in the genes encoding subunits of SDH, collectively known as SDHx genes, now account for the largest share of hereditary pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Moreover, SDH deficiencies have also been identified in gastrointestinal stromal tumor, renal cell carcinoma, and pituitary adenomaA - summarized in Table 2.1. Isocitrate dehydrogenase has also been implicated in a small number of cases. Germline mutations in at least 19 genes have now been identified, and many of these have also been reported to occur as somatic-only mutations in genuinely sporadic tumors. Given the newly recognized importance of heredity, prospective recognition, and accurate pathological diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and their syndromically associated tumors is now essential for patient care.

AB  - Background. Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) show the highest degree of heritability in human neoplasms. However, despite the wide number of alterations until now reported in PCCs, it is likely that other susceptibility genes remain still unknown, especially for those PCCs not clearly syndromic. Methods. Whole exome sequencing of tumor DNA was performed on a set of twelve PCCs clinically defined as sporadic. Results. About 50% of PCCs examined had somatic mutations on the known susceptibility VHL, NF1, and RET genes. In addition to these driver events, mutations on SYNE1, ABCC10, and RAD54B genes were also detected. Moreover, extremely rare germline variants were present in half of the sporadic PCC samples analyzed, in particular variants of MAX and SAMD9L were detected in the germline of cases wild-type for mutations in the known susceptibility genes. Conclusions. Additional somatic passenger mutations can be associated with known susceptibility VHL, NF1, and RET genes in PCCs, and a wide number of germline variants with still unknown clinical significance can be detected in these patients. Therefore, many efforts should be aimed to better define the pathogenetic role of all these germline variants for discovering novel potential therapeutic targets for this disease still orphan of effective treatments.

AB  - <b>Background:</b> Static single timeframe <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT is useful for the localization and functional characterization of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-uptake varies between PPGLs with different genotypes and highest standardized uptake values (SUVs) are observed in case of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations, possibly related to enhanced aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells. The exact determinants of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG accumulation in PPGL are unknown. We performed dynamic PET/CT scanning to assess in vivo <sup>18</sup>F-FDG pharmacokinetics to investigate whether it has added value over static PET to distinguish different genotypes. <b>Methods:</b> Dynamic <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT was performed in 13 sporadic PPGLs and 13 PPGLs from 11 patients with hereditary mutations in SDHA/B/D, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), RET and neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a two-tissue compartment tracer kinetic model. The derived transfer rate-constants for transmembranous glucose flux (K1 (in), k2 (out)) and intracellular phosphorylation (k3) along with the fractional blood volume (Vb) were analyzed using non-linear regression analysis. Glucose metabolic rate (MRglc) was calculated using Patlak linear regression analysis. Maximum SUVs (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of the lesions were determined on additional static PET/CT. <b>Results:</b> Both MRglc and SUV<sub>max</sub> for hereditary cluster 1 (SDHx, VHL) tumors were significantly higher than for hereditary cluster 2 (RET, NF1) (P<0.01) and sporadic tumors (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). Median k3 in cluster 1 was significantly higher than for sporadic tumors (P<0.01). Median Vb for cluster 1 was significantly higher than for cluster 2 tumors (P<0.01). No statistical significant differences in K1 and k2 were found between the groups. Cutoff values for k3 to distinguish between cluster 1 and other tumors were established at 0.015 min-1 (100% sensitivity, 15,8% specificity) and 0.636 min-1 (100% specificity, 85.7% sensitivity). MRglc significantly correlated with SUV<sub>max</sub> (P = 0.001) and k3 (P = 0.002). <b>Conclusion:</b> In vivo metabolic tumor profiling in patients with PPGL can be achieved by assessing <sup>18</sup>F-FDG pharmacokinetics using dynamic PET/CT scanning. Cluster 1 PPGLs can be reliably identified by a high <sup>18</sup>F-FDG phosphorylation rate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumours in many organ systems, including renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. It is not completely understood what underlies the development of renal pathology, and the use of murine Vhl models has been challenging due to limitations in disease conservation. We previously described a zebrafish model bearing inactivating mutations in the orthologue of the human VHL gene.
METHODS: We used histopathological and functional assays to investigate the pronephric and glomerular developmental defects in vhl mutant zebrafish, supported by human cell culture assays.
RESULTS: Here, we report that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity in zebrafish embryos. vhl mutant glomeruli are enlarged, cxcr4a+ capillary loops are dilated and the Bowman space is widened. While we did not observe pronephric cysts, the cells of the proximal convoluted and anterior proximal straight tubule are enlarged, periodic acid schiff (PAS) and Oil Red O positive, and display a clear cytoplasm after hematoxylin and eosine staining. Ultrastructural analysis showed the vhl-/- tubule to accumulate large numbers of vesicles of variable size and electron density. Microinjection of the endocytic fluorescent marker AM1-43 in zebrafish embryos revealed an accumulation of endocytic vesicles in the vhl mutant pronephric tubule, which we can recapitulate in human cells lacking VHL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity during zebrafish development, and suggests a role for VHL in endocytic vesicle trafficking.

AB  - The neural crest (NC) is a transient, multipotent and migratory cell population that generates an astonishingly diverse array of cell types during vertebrate development. These cells, which originate from the ectoderm in a region lateral to the neural plate in the neural fold, give rise to neurons, glia, melanocytes, chondrocytes, smooth muscle cells, odontoblasts and neuroendocrine cells, among others. Neurocristopathies (NCP) are a class of pathologies occurring in vertebrates, especially in humans that result from the abnormal specification, migration, differentiation or death of neural crest cells during embryonic development. Various pigment, skin, thyroid and hearing disorders, craniofacial and heart abnormalities, malfunctions of the digestive tract and tumors can also be considered as neurocristopathies. In this review we revisit the current classification and propose a new way to classify NCP based on the embryonic origin of the affected tissues, on recent findings regarding the molecular mechanisms that drive NC formation, and on the increased complexity of current molecular embryology techniques.

AB  - Clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and intracellular lipid accumulation by unknown pathomechanisms. The immunochemical analysis of 356 RCCs revealed high abundance of apoA-I and apoB, as well as scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) in the ccRCC subtype. Given the characteristic loss of VHL function in ccRCC, we used VHL-defective and VHL-proficient cells to study the potential influence of VHL on lipoprotein uptake. VHL-defective patient-derived ccRCC cells and cell lines (786O and RCC4) showed enhanced uptake as well as less resecretion and degradation of radio-iodinated HDL and LDL (<sup>125</sup>I-HDL and <sup>125</sup>I-LDL, respectively) compared with the VHL-proficient cells. The ccRCC cells showed enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and SR-BI expression compared with normal kidney epithelial cells. Uptake of <sup>125</sup>I-HDL and <sup>125</sup>I-LDL by patient-derived normal kidney epithelial cells as well as the VHL-reexpressing ccRCC cell lines, 786-O-VHL and RCC4-O-VHL cells, was strongly enhanced by VEGF treatment. The knockdown of the VEGF coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP1), as well as blocking of SR-BI significantly reduced the uptake of lipoproteins into ccRCC cells in vitro. LDL stimulated proliferation of 786-O cells more potently than 786-O-VHL cells in a NRP1- and SR-BI-dependent manner. In conclusion, enhanced lipoprotein uptake due to increased activities of VEGF/NRP1 and SR-BI promotes lipid accumulation and proliferation of VHL-defective ccRCC cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by loss of a functional Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. We investigated the potential of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VHL as biomarkers in metastatic ccRCC (m-ccRCC) patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 3 VHL SNPs in 199 m-ccRCC patients: rs1642742 T > C, rs1642743 A > G, and rs1678607 C > A. Primary end points were response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) after start of first-line TKI. RR was compared with Fisher's exact test, and PFS and OS with Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression. Secondary end points were association with VHL promotor hypermethylation, VHL mutation status, VHL loss of heterozygosity, >= 25% sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, and expression of genes implicated in angiogenesis and immunoresponse (Fisher's exact test and unpaired t tests).
RESULTS: The minor alleles of rs1642742 and rs1642743, known to be in close linkage disequilibrium, were associated with poor outcome, following a recessive pattern. For the rs1642742 CC versus TT/TC genotype, OS was 11 versus 26 months (hazard ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.6; P = .015). For the rs1642743 GG versus AA/AG genotype, OS was 15 versus 28 months (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.0; P = .004). After multivariable analysis, both remained linked with poor OS (P = .018 and P = .009, respectively). There was a trend toward shorter PFS and poorer RR. Both SNPs were associated with >= 25% sarcomatoid dedifferentiation (P = .037 and .006, respectively). No significant results were found for rs1678607.
CONCLUSION: rs1642742 and rs1642743 are candidate biomarkers for poor OS in m-ccRCC patients receiving first-line VEGFR-TKI. They are associated with higher levels of sarcomatoid dedifferentiation.

AB  - Chromaffin tumors, e.g. pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are caused by germline mutations of several susceptibility genes in 30-40% of the patients. The corresponding syndromes are multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2, RET gene), von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), paraganglioma syndrome types 1-5 (PGL1-5, SDHx gene) and familial pheochromocytoma due to mutations in the MAX and TMEM127 genes. Clinically, screening for such diseases should be carried out by clinical symptoms and mutation analyses. Important indications can be found in the history of patients and their families, young age of manifestation (<30 years), extra-adrenal localization and the presence of metastatic pheochromocytomas. Organ-preserving endoscopic adrenal operations are nowadays standard for hereditary pheochromocytomas. Previous studies have shown that the reoccurrence of tumors in residual tissue is rare and can occur many years later and that metastatic tumors arising from such recurrences are very rare. When a mutation is detected in a susceptibility gene, a multidisciplinary follow-up care tailored to each individual syndrome is essential.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterised by a poor survival. Although genotype-phenotype correlation has been described in many studies, the risk factors for VHL survival remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate the median survival of Chinese patients with VHL disease and explore whether VHL survival is influenced by genetic and clinical factors.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited 340 patients from 127 VHL families. Kaplan-Meier plot and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the median survival and assess how survival was influenced by birth year, birth order, sex, family history, mutation type, onset age and first presenting symptom.
RESULTS: The estimated median life expectancy for Chinese patients with VHL disease was 62 years. Patients with early-onset age, positive family history and truncating mutation types had poorer overall and VHL-related survival. Patients with haemangioblastoma as their first presenting symptom were related to a higher risk of death from central nervous system haemangioblastoma than those with abdominal lesions (HR 8.84, 95% CI 2.04 to 38.37, P=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: This largest VHL survival analysis indicates that onset age, family history, mutation type and first presenting symptom have an effect on the survival of patients with VHL disease, which is helpful to genetic counselling and clinical decision-making.

AB  - Inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene is a highly frequent genetic event in the carcinogenesis of central nervous system-(CNS) hemangioblastomas (HBs). The patterning of the similar embryonic vasculogenesis is an increasing concern in HB-neovascularization, and the classic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis driven by VHL loss-of-function from human endothelium have been questioned. With this regard, we identify a distinct, VHL silencing-driven mechanism in which human vascular endothelial cells by means of increasing cell proliferation and decreasing cell apoptosis, is concomitant with facilitating accumulation of Twist1 protein in vascular endothelial cells in vitro. Importantly, this molecular mechanism is also pinpointed in CNS-HBs, and associated with the process of HB-neovascularization. In contrast with recent studies of HB-neovascularization, these modified cells did not endow with the typical features of vasculogenesis, indicating that this is a common angiogenesis implementing the formation of the vascular network. Taken together, these findings suggest that vasculogenesis and angiogenesis may constitute complementary mechanisms for HB-neovascularization, and could provide a rational recognition of single anti-angiogenic intervention including targeting to the Twist1 signalling for HBs.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to systematically investigate the clinical features, diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome in order to improve understanding of this disease. A total of 3 cases of VHL syndrome treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College (Zunyi, China) between September 2014 and October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The associated literature was reviewed, and the diagnostic and therapeutic features were discussed. Case 1 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by a renal tumor on the right side, and radical tumor resection in the right kidney was performed. Postoperative pathological examination indicated clear cell carcinoma. Case 2 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma. The left-side adrenal tumor was removed, and postoperative pathological analysis was suggestive of adrenal pheochromocytoma. Case 3 visited the hospital due to the presence of masses on the left and right sides of the kidney, but did not undergo surgery for personal reasons. Follow-ups were scheduled subsequent to surgery at another hospital. The diagnosis in all 3 cases was confirmed by genetic testing, where VHL mutations were detected in all patients. Following surgery, pedigree and genetic analysis was performed in all 3 pedigrees and VHL mutations were identified in 7 family members. The diagnosis of VHL syndrome should be based on the clinical manifestation of the patients and the results of genetic tests. DNA analysis of mutations is the main method for diagnosis. An appropriate surgical plan should be formulated based on the site, size and number of tumors, and the condition of the patient. Since VHL syndrome is an inheritable genetic disorder and relapse following surgery is common, pedigree analysis of the patient and lifelong follow-ups are essential. Additionally, physicians should pay attention to VHL syndrome in order to avoid missing diagnosis or misdiagnosis.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder, characterised by hypervascularised tumour formation in multiple organ systems. Vision loss associated with retinal capillary hemangioblastomas remains one of the earliest complications of VHL disease. The mortality of Vhl<sup>-/-</sup> mice in utero restricted modelling of VHL disease in this mammalian model. Zebrafish harbouring a recessive germline mutation in the vhl gene represent a viable, alternative vertebrate model to investigate associated ocular loss-of-function phenotypes. Previous studies reported neovascularisation of the brain, eye and trunk together with oedema in the vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish eye. In this study, we demonstrate vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish almost entirely lack visual function. Furthermore, hyaloid vasculature networks in the vhl<sup>-/-</sup> eye are improperly formed and this phenotype is concomitant with development of an ectopic intraretinal vasculature. Sunitinib malate, a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, market authorised for cancer, reversed the ocular behavioural and morphological phenotypes observed in vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish. We conclude that the zebrafish vhl gene contributes to an endogenous molecular barrier that prevents development of intraretinal vasculature, and that pharmacological intervention with sunitinib can improve visual function and hyaloid vessel patterning while reducing abnormally formed ectopic intraretinal vessels in vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish.

AB  - Kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), is a disease of increasing incidence that commonly is seen in the general practice of nephrology. Despite this state of affairs, this fascinating and highly morbid disease frequently is under-represented, or even absent, from the curriculum of nephrologists in training and generally is underemphasized in national nephrology meetings, both scientific as well as clinical. Although classic concepts in cancer research in general had led to the concept that cancer is a disease resulting from mutations in the control of growth-regulating pathways, reinforced by the discovery of oncogenes, more contemporary research, particularly in kidney cancer, has uncovered changes in metabolic pathways mediated by those same genes that control tumor energetics and biosynthesis. This adaptation of classic biochemical pathways to the tumor's advantage has been labeled metabolic reprogramming. For example, in the case of kidney cancer there exists a near-universal presence of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) inactivation in the most common form, clear cell RCC (ccRCC), leading to activation of hypoxia-relevant and other metabolic pathways. Studies of this and other pathways in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) have been particularly revealing, leading to the concept that ccRCC can itself be considered a metabolic disease. For this reason, the relatively new method of metabolomics has become a useful technique in the study of ccRCC to tease out those pathways that have been reprogrammed by the tumor to its maximum survival advantage. Furthermore, identification of the nodes of such pathways can lead to novel areas for drug intervention in a disease for which such targets are seriously lacking. Further research and dissemination of these concepts, likely using omics techniques, will lead to clinical trials of therapeutics specifically targeted to tumor metabolism, rather than those generally toxic to all proliferating cells. Such novel agents are highly likely to be more effective than existing drugs and to have far fewer adverse effects. This review provides a general overview of the technique of metabolomics and then discusses how it and other omics techniques have been used to further our understanding of the basic biology of kidney cancer as well as to identify new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The regulation of oxygen (O<inf>2</inf>) levels is crucial in embryogenesis and adult life, as O<inf>2</inf> controls a multitude of key cellular functions. Low oxygen levels (hypoxia) are relevant for tissue physiology as they are integral to adequate metabolism regulation and cell fate. Hence, the hypoxia response is of utmost importance for cell, organ and organism function and is dependent on the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIF pathway activity is strictly regulated by the family of oxygen-sensitive HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins. Physiologic hypoxia is a hallmark of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche in the bone marrow. This niche facilitates HSC quiescence and survival. The present review focuses on current knowledge and the many open questions regarding the impact of PHDs/HIFs and other proteins of the hypoxia pathway on the HSC niche and on normal and malignant hematopoiesis.

AB  - Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) drive angiogenesis and cancer cell growth, contributing to an aggressive tumor phenotype. HIF-alpha protein levels and activity are controlled at the post-translational level by HIF hydroxylases. Hydroxylated HIF-alpha is recognized by the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor and targeted for degradation. The HIF hydroxylases are members of the iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, which require ascorbate as cofactor for activity. Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) harbor mutations in the VHL gene, whereas papillary RCC (pRCC) have a functional VHL. These natural occurring VHL variants in RCC enable the testing, in clinical samples, of the hypothesis that ascorbate modulates HIF-alpha levels through its role as a cofactor for the HIF hydroxylases. We measured ascorbate, HIF-1alpha, and HIF-2alpha protein and HIF downstream targets BNIP3, CA9, cyclin D1, GLUT1, and VEGF (combined to generate the HIF pathway score) in VHL-defective ccRCC (n = 73) and VHL-proficient pRCC human tumor tissue (n = 41). HIF and ascorbate levels were increased in ccRCC and pRCC tumors compared to matched renal cortex. HIF-1 and total HIF pathway activation scores were decreased with higher ascorbate in pRCC tumors (Spearman r = -0.38, p < 0.05 and r = -0.35, p < 0.05). This was not evident for ccRCC tumors. In mechanistic studies in vitro, ascorbate influenced HIF-1 activity in VHL-proficient, but not VHL-defective ccRCC cells. Our results indicate that ccRCC, which lacks a functional VHL, does not respond to ascorbate-mediated modulation of the HIF response. This contrasts with the demonstrated association between ascorbate content and the HIF pathway observed in pRCC and other tumors with a functional VHL. The results support a role for ascorbate as a modulator of HIF activity and tumor aggression in cancer types with a functional hypoxic response.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the germline variations of genes RET, VHL, SDHD and SDHB in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma and to evaluate variations of these genes in Chinese patients.
METHODS: Patients who were treated in Peking University First Hospital from September 2012 to March 2014 and diagnosed with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma by pathologists were included in this study. Twelve patients were included in total, of whom 11 had pheochromocytoma, and 1 had paraganglioma. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the leukocytes of peripheral blood of the patients. The exons 10, 11, 13-16 of the RET gene, and all exons of VHL, SDHB and SDHD genes and their nearby introns (+/-20 bp) were amplified with polymerase chain reactions, and the products were sent to a biotechnology company for sequencing. The sequencing results were compared with wildtype sequences of these genes to identify variations. One of the patients was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. A family analysis was performed in his kindred, and his family members received genetic tests for the related variations.
RESULTS: Three patients were found to have germline gene variations. A c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene was found in a patient with malignant pheochromocytoma. A c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation, as well as c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were found in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. After a family analysis, five family members of this patient were found to have the same variations. c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were also found in a clinical sporadic patient without evidence of malignancy. A patient with congenital single ventricle malformation and pheochromocytoma was included in this study, and no variation with clinical significance was found in the four genes of this patient.
CONCLUSION: 25% (3/12) patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma were found to have missense or nonsense germline gene variations in this study, including the c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene, the c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation of the RET gene, and c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene. The former two variations have already been confirmed to be pathogenic. The existence of these variations in Chinese patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma was validated in this study, which supports the conclusion that genetic testing is necessary to be generally performed in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the germline variations of genes RET, VHL, SDHD and SDHB in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma and to evaluate variations of these genes in Chinese patients. METHOD(S): Patients who were treated in Peking University First Hospital from September 2012 to March 2014 and diagnosed with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma by pathologists were included in this study. Twelve patients were included in total, of whom 11 had pheochromocytoma, and 1 had paraganglioma. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the leukocytes of peripheral blood of the patients. The exons 10, 11, 13-16 of the RET gene, and all exons of VHL, SDHB and SDHD genes and their nearby introns (+/-20 bp) were amplified with polymerase chain reactions, and the products were sent to a biotechnology company for sequencing. The sequencing results were compared with wildtype sequences of these genes to identify variations. One of the patients was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. A family analysis was performed in his kindred, and his family members received genetic tests for the related variations. RESULT(S): Three patients were found to have germline gene variations. A c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene was found in a patient with malignant pheochromocytoma. A c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation, as well as c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were found in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. After a family analysis, five family members of this patient were found to have the same variations. c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were also found in a clinical sporadic patient without evidence of malignancy. A patient with congenital single ventricle malformation and pheochromocytoma was included in this study, and no variation with clinical significance was found in the four genes of this patient. CONCLUSION(S): 25% (3/12) patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma were found to have missense or nonsense germline gene variations in this study, including the c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene, the c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation of the RET gene, and c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene. The former two variations have already been confirmed to be pathogenic. The existence of these variations in Chinese patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma was validated in this study, which supports the conclusion that genetic testing is necessary to be generally performed in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma.

AB  - Hypoxia is the most critical factor for maintaining stemness. During embryonic development, neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in hypoxic niches, and different levels of oxygen pressure and time of hypoxia exposure play important roles in the development of NSCs. Such hypoxic niches exist in adult brain tissue, where the neural precursors originate. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key transcription heterodimers consisting of regulatory alpha-subunits (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, HIF-3alpha) and a constitutive beta-subunit (HIF-beta). Regulation of downstream targets determines the fate of NSCs. In turn, the stability of HIFs-alpha is regulated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), whose activity is principally modulated by PHD substrates like oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), and the co-factors ascorbate (ASC) and ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>). It follows that the transcriptional activity of HIFs is actually determined by the contents of O<sub>2</sub>, alpha-KG, ASC, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>. In normoxia, HIFs-alpha are rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which PHDs, activated by O<sub>2</sub>, lead to hydroxylation of HIFs-alpha at residues 402 and 564, followed by recognition by the tumor suppressor protein von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) as an E3 ligase and ubiquitin labeling. Conversely, in hypoxia, the activity of PHDs is inhibited by low O<sub>2</sub> levels and HIFs-alpha can thus be stabilized. Hence, suppression of PHD activity in normoxic conditions, mimicking the effect of hypoxia, might be beneficial for preserving the stemness of NSCs, and it is clinically relevant as a therapeutic approach for enhancing the number of NSCs in vitro and for cerebral ischemia injury in vivo. This study will review the putative role of PHD inhibitors on the self-renewal of NSCs.

AB  - p-Cresyl sulfate (pCS), a uremic toxin, can cause renal damage and dysfunction. Studies suggest that renal dysfunction increases the prevalence of renal cancer. However, the effect of pCS on the proliferation and migration of renal cancer is unclear. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) expresses mutant von Hippel-Lindau gene and is difficult to treat. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and 2-alpha (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha) as well as microRNA-21 (miR-21) can regulate the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells. However, the association between HIF-alpha and miR-21 in ccRCC remains unclear. Therefore, the effects of pCS on ccRCC cells were investigated for HIF-alpha and miR-21 signals. Our results showed that pCS induced overexpression of HIF-1alpha and promoted the proliferation and regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins, including E-cadherin, fibronectin, twist and vimentin in ccRCC cells. pCS treatment increased miR-21 expression. Specifically, inhibition of miR-21 blocked pCS-induced proliferation and migration. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that pCS directly induced the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells through mechanisms involving miR-21/HIF-1alpha signaling pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited cancer syndrome, and VHL is identified as a tumor suppressor gene. The main objective of this study was to identify disease-causing mutations in a Chinese family affected with VHL disease.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood from a Chinese family with VHL. A predicted pathogenic variant was identified by targeted exome capture technology and next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: A novel heterozygous mutation (c.349 T > A, p.W117R) was detected in affected family members. No mutation was detected in unaffected family members or in the 150 normal controls. The mutation segregated with the disease phenotype throughout three generations. Histopathological examination revealed the characteristics of hemangioblastoma.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel W117R was detected in the VHL gene that caused retinal hemangioblastomas in affected members of a Chinese family.

AB  - Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bispecific molecules containing a target protein binder and an ubiquitin ligase binder connected by a linker. By recruiting an ubiquitin ligase to a target protein, PROTACs promote ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the target protein. The generation of effective PROTACs depends on the nature of the protein/ligase ligand pair, linkage site, linker length, and linker composition, all of which have been difficult to address in a systematic way. Herein, we describe a "click chemistry" approach for the synthesis of PROTACs. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with the bromodomain and extraterminal domain-4 (BRD4) ligand JQ-1 (3) and ligase binders targeting cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) proteins. An AlphaScreen proximity assay was used to determine the ability of PROTACs to form the ternary ligase-PROTAC-target protein complex and a MSD assay to measure cellular degradation of the target protein promoted by PROTACs.

AB  - <b>Rationale:</b> Aberrant bronchial epithelium-fibroblast communication is essential for the airway remodeling that contributes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exosomes have emerged as novel mediators of intercellular communication, but their role in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced COPD is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of exosomal miR-21 in the dysfunctional epithelium-fibroblast cross-talk caused by CS. <b>Methods:</b> Normal or CS extract (CSE)-treated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were co-cultured with bronchial fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells). Exosomes were obtained from culture media or serum by use of commercial kits. The size distribution and concentration of exosomes were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis using a ZetaView particle tracker from ParticleMetrix. Inhibition of miR-21 levels by tail vein injection of antagomir-21 into mice exposed to CS was used to demonstrate the role of miR-21 in airway remodeling leading to COPD in animals. <b>Results:</b> For MRC-5 cells, co-culture with CSE-treated HBE cells or with exosomes derived from CSE-treated HBE cells resulted in the myofibroblast differentiation phenotype. Exosomal miR-21 was responsible for myofibroblast differentiation through hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) signaling by targeting the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL); HIF-1alpha transcriptionally regulated the alpha-SMA gene. For mice, downregulation of miR-21 prevented CS-induced airway remodeling. The levels of exosomal miR-21 were high in sera of smokers and COPD patients and inversely correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC. <b>Conclusion:</b> We demonstrate that CS triggers the modification of exosome components and identify miR-21 derived from bronchial epithelial cells as a mediator of myofibroblast differentiation through the pVHL/HIF-1alpha signaling pathway, which has potential value for diagnosis and treatment of COPD.

AB  - Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are classified as grade I tumors with uncertain origin according to the World Health Organization's classification system. HBs are characterized by rich mesenchymal cells and abundant capillaries. It has been shown that tumorigenesis of HBs depends on mutational inactivation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, the majority of patients will undergo VHL single gene test, and sequencing scheme is rarely used in clinic. In this study, we described a girl and her father successively found to have HBs within half a year. The results of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing analysis showed that both of them carried heterozygous mutation of RNF139 p.Q650R. This mutation was interpreted as Pathogenic variation based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline. Sanger sequencing was performed with other family members. No mutation on rs118184842 locus of RNF139 gene was found in the samples from the girl's mother, uncle and aunt. This report supports that the novel mutation of RNF139 p.Q650R probably serve as a key role in HBs progression.

AB  - Cases with pituitary adenoma comprise 10-25% of intracranial neoplasm, being the third most common intracranial tumor, most of the adenomas are considered to be benign. About 35% of pituitary adenomas are invasive. This review summarized the known molecular basis of the invasiveness of pituitary adenomas. The study pointed out that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, pituitary tumor transforming gene, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, mainly MMP-2, and MMP-9) are core molecules responsible for the invasiveness of pituitary adenomas. The reason is that these molecules have the ability to directly or indirectly induce cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, degradation, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. HIF-1alpha induced by hypoxia or apoplexy inside the adenoma might be the initiating factor of invasive transformation, followed with angiogenesis for overexpressed VEGF, EMT for overexpressed PTTG, degradation of ECM for overexpressed MMPs, creating a suitable microenvironment within the tumor. Together, they form a complex interactive network. More investigations are required to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the invasiveness of pituitary adenomas.

AB  - LncRNA H19 encoded by the H19 imprinting gene plays an important regulatory role in the cell. Recently study has found that in hypoxic cells, the expression of H19 gene changes, and the transcription factors and protein involved in the expression change accordingly. Through the involvement of specific protein 1 (SP1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) binds directly to the H19 promoter and induces the up-regulation of H19 expression under hypoxic conditions. The tumor suppressor protein p53 may also mediate the expression of the H19 gene, in part by interfering with HIF-la activity under hypoxia stress. The miR675-5p encoded by exon 1 of H19 promotes hypoxia response by driving the nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha and reducing the expression of VHL gene, which is a physiological HIF-1alpha inhibitor. In addition, under the condition of hypoxia, the expression of transporter on cell membrane changes, and the transition of the intracellular glucose metabolism pathway from aerobic oxidation to anaerobic glycolysis is also involved in the involvement of H19. Therefore, H19 may be a key gene that maintains intracellular balance under hypoxic conditions and drives adaptive cell survival under conditions of hypoxia stress.

AB  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an important tumor suppressor that is lost in the majority of clear cell carcinoma of renal cancer (ccRCC). Its regulatory pathway involves the activity of E3 ligase, which targets hypoxia inducible factor alpha (including HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha) for proteasome degradation. In recent years, emerging literature suggests that VHL also possesses other HIF-independent functions. This review will focus on VHL-mediated signaling pathways involving the latest identified substrates/binding partners, including N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (NDRG3), AKT, and G9a, etc., and their physiological roles in hypoxia signaling and cancer. We will also discuss the crosstalk between VHL and NF-kappaB signaling. Lastly, we will review the latest findings on targeting VHL signaling in cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Making a specific diagnosis of pancreatic cysts preoperatively is difficult. The new disposable Moray micro forceps biopsy (MFB) device allows tissue sampling from the pancreatic cyst wall/septum and aims to improve diagnosis. This study compares the diagnostic performance of the MFB with the current conventional analysis of pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF).
METHODS: A total of 48 patients sampled with MFB were identified. Cysts were classified as mucinous on PCF based on extracellular mucin/mucinous epithelium, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels >=192 ng/mL, or KRAS/GNAS mutation. A diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm was supported by GNAS mutation; a diagnosis of serous cystadenoma was supported by Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mutation. A diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm required the presence of subepithelial ovarian-type stroma. A high-risk cyst was defined as a mucinous cyst with high-grade dysplasia or an adenocarcinoma. Comparisons in diagnostic performance between PCF and MFB were made.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 69.6 years (range, 27-90 years); 25 of 48 patients (52.1%) were female. Cysts were in the pancreatic head (13 patients), neck (2 patients), body (20 patients), and tail (13 patients), averaging 3.1 cm (range, 1.2-6.0 cm). There was concordance with mucinous versus nonmucinous classification (60.4% for PCF vs 58.3% for MFB; P = .949). Three high-risk cysts were detected by PCF and 2 were detected by MFB (P = .670). However, MFB diagnosed significantly more specific cysts compared with PCF (50.0% for MFB vs 18.8% for PCF; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: PCF analysis and MFB have comparable performance in distinguishing between mucinous and nonmucinous cysts and for detecting high-risk cysts. However, MFB was found to be superior for diagnosing specific cyst subtypes, thus adding significant value to preoperative patient management.

AB  - AIMS: Hypoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH), a potentially fatal disorder characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular hypertrophy. However, how they are linked in the context of PH is not completely understood. We, therefore, investigated the role of the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox in the response to hypoxia both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We found that hypoxia decreased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of p22phox dependent on prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein von Hippel Lindau (pVHL), which resulted in p22phox stabilization and accumulation. p22phox promoted vascular proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis under normoxia and hypoxia. Increased levels of p22phox were also detected in lungs and hearts from mice with hypoxia-induced PH. Mice harboring a point mutation (Y121H) in the p22phox gene, which resulted in decreased p22phox stability and subsequent loss of this protein, were protected against hypoxia-induced PH. Mechanistically, p22phox contributed to ROS generation under normoxia, hypoxia, and hypoxia/reoxygenation. p22phox increased the levels and activity of HIF1alpha, the major cellular regulator of hypoxia adaptation, under normoxia and hypoxia, possibly by decreasing the levels of the PHD cofactors ascorbate and iron(II), and it contributed to the downregulation of the tumor suppressor miR-140 by hypoxia.
INNOVATION: These data identify p22phox as an important regulator of the hypoxia response both in vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSION: p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidases contribute to the pathophysiology of PH induced by hypoxia.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the designation of the diverse and highly aggressive breast cancers that lack the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2. Due to the lack of recognized molecular targets for therapy, chemotherapy remains the primary established treatment for TNBC. In TNBC, numerous exogenous and intrinsic factors cause accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to disrupt cellular proteostasis in a condition termed ER stress. As an adaptation, cells activate a network of pathways, the unfolded protein response (UPR), to manage ER stress. Chronic stress, a risk factor in cancer initiation and progression, keeps the UPR engaged while its apoptotic function gets gradually attenuated. The UPR has been increasingly recognized to have crucial roles both in physiological contexts and tumor pathology. In this review, we summarize the factors that may contribute to the regulation of the UPR in TNBC and its impact on various aspects of tumor biology. In addition, we review recent progress on the pharmacological targeting of the UPR, which holds therapeutic potential for TNBC intervention. Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The abundant and reversible N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification and its modulators have important roles in regulating various gene expression and biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that fat mass and obesity associated (FTO), as an m6A demethylase, plays a critical anti-tumorigenic role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). FTO is suppressed in ccRCC tissue. The low expression of FTO in human ccRCC correlates with increased tumour severity and poor patient survival. The Von Hippel-Lindau-deficient cells expressing FTO restores mitochondrial activity, induces oxidative stress and ROS production and shows impaired tumour growth, through increasing expression of PGC-1alpha by reducing m6A levels in its mRNA transcripts. Our work demonstrates the functional importance of the m6A methylation and its modulator, and uncovers a critical FTO-PGC-1alpha axis for developing effective therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ccRCC.
