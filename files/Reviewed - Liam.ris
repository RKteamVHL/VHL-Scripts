N2  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is characterized by hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts, and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache, vomiting, gait disturbances, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL syndrome and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems, unless bilateral, in which case they may result in infertility. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of VHL is established in a proband who fulfills existing diagnostic clinical criteria. Identification of a heterozygous germline VHL pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis if clinical features are inconclusive. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Intervention for most CNS lesions (remove brain and spinal lesions completely when large and/or symptomatic); treat retinal (but not optic nerve) angiomas prospectively; early surgery (nephron-sparing or partial nephrectomy when possible) for renal cell carcinoma; renal transplantation following bilateral nephrectomy; remove pheochromocytomas (partial adrenalectomy when possible); monitor pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors and consider removal of neuroendocrine tumors; consider surgical removal of endolymphatic sac tumors (particularly small tumors in order to preserve hearing and vestibular function); cystadenomas of the epididymis or broad ligament need treatment when symptomatic or threatening fertility. Prevention of secondary complications: Early detection and removal of tumors to prevent/minimize secondary deficits such as hearing loss, vision loss, neurologic symptoms, and the need for renal replacement therapy. Surveillance: For individuals with VHL syndrome, those with a VHL pathogenic variant, and at-risk relatives of unknown genetic status: Starting at age one year: Annual evaluation for neurologic symptoms, vision problems, and hearing disturbance; annual blood pressure monitoring; annual ophthalmology evaluation. Starting at age five years: Annual blood or urinary fractionated metanephrines; audiology assessment every two to three years; thin-slice MRI with contrast of the internal auditory canal in those with repeated ear infections. Starting at age 16 years: Annual abdominal ultrasound; MRI scan of the abdomen and MRI of the brain and total spine every two years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Tobacco products should be avoided since they are considered a risk factor for kidney cancer; chemicals and industrial toxins known to affect VHL-involved organs should be avoided; contact sports should be avoided if adrenal or pancreatic lesions are present. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variant in a family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk family members to eliminate the need for surveillance of family members who have not inherited the pathogenic variant. Pregnancy management: Intensified surveillance for cerebellar hemangioblastoma and pheochromocytoma during preconception and pregnancy; MRI without contrast of the cerebellum at four months' gestation. GENETIC COUNSELING: VHL syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 80% of individuals with VHL syndrome have an affected parent and about 20% have VHL syndrome as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Parental mosaicism has been described; the incidence is not known. The offspring of an individual with VHL syndrome are at a 50% risk of inheriting the VHL pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in a family member.

N2  - The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is the major proteolytic quality control system in cells. In this review we discuss the impact of a deregulation of this pathway on neuronal function and its causal relationship to the intracellular deposition of ubiquitin protein conjugates in pathological inclusion bodies in all the major chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We describe the intricate nature of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and discuss the paradox of protein aggregation, i.e. its potential toxic/protective effect in neurodegeneration. The relations between some of the dysfunctional components of the pathway and neurodegeneration are presented. We highlight possible ubiquitin/proteasome pathway-targeting therapeutic approaches, such as activating the proteasome, enhancing ubiquitination and promoting SUMOylation that might be important to slow/treat the progression of neurodegeneration. Finally, a model time line is presented for neurodegeneration starting at the initial injurious events up to protein aggregation and cell death, with potential time points for therapeutic intervention.

N2  - The mortality in von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is due to the development of central nervous system or abdominal malignancies, particularly renal cell carcinomas. The abdominal manifestations of VHL discovered in the radiological screening of 22 members of an affected family are described. We discuss the problems of making the diagnosis and of detecting small renal and pancreatic tumours against a background of multiple cystic disease. A radiological screening and surveillance protocol using ultrasound and computed tomography is described. [References: 29]

N2  - Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour-suppressor protein (pVHL) is associated with the von Hippel-Lindau cancer syndrome and the majority of kidney cancers. New evidence suggests that pVHL has properties of an F-box protein that targets the alpha-subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 for oxygen-dependent ubiquitination.

N2  - Ten members of a large family who showed manifestations of either von Hippel-Lindau disease or von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis were examined. Three of 10 members were found to have retinal angiomas which had not been present on fundus examination 3 years previously. These angiomas were associated with ocular and systemic signs of neurofibromatosis. These cases show overlapping manifestations of different phakomatoses and provide support for the concept of a common aetiology for these diseases.

N2  - Current standard treatments for patients with metastatic (stage IV) renal cell carcinoma involve both surgical removal of tumors and treatment with biological agents such as interleukin 2 and/or IFN-alpha. Unfortunately, such approaches are inadequate for most patients with stage IV disease; the result is a median time to progression of 2 to 4 months and an overall survival of 6 to 17 months. Standard chemotherapy has been uniformly disappointing in this disorder. It is clear that new therapies are needed to approach these patients. Recently, a greater understanding of cancer genetics has led to the successful development of novel therapeutics directed against targets linked to specific types of cancer. During the past decade, researchers have identified the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene as an important tumor suppressor in clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. Elucidation of the VHL gene product (pVHL) and its regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor signaling have created a potential genetic basis for growth factor-targeted strategies in this disease. This review will focus on the potential growth factor targets in clear cell carcinoma, their relation to VHL and hypoxia-inducible factor, and the clinical challenges that face their development.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. In oxygenated and iron replete cells, HIF-alpha subunits are rapidly destroyed by a mechanism that involves ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. This process is suppressed by hypoxia and iron chelation, allowing transcriptional activation. Here we show that the interaction between human pVHL and a specific domain of the HIF-1alpha subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue (HIF-1alpha P564) by an enzyme we have termed HIF-alpha prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). An absolute requirement for dioxygen as a cosubstrate and iron as cofactor suggests that HIF-PH functions directly as a cellular oxygen sensor.

N2  - PURPOSE: To enhance prognostic information of protein biomarkers for clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs), we analyzed them within prognostic groups of ccRCC harboring different tumor characteristics of this clinically and molecularly heterogeneous tumor entity. METHODS: Tissue microarrays from 145 patients with primary ccRCC were immunohistochemically analyzed for VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor), Ki67 (marker of proliferation 1), p53 (tumor protein p53), p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A), survivin (baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5), and UEA-1 (Ulex europaeus agglutinin I) to assess microvessel-density. RESULTS: When analyzing all patients, nuclear staining of Ki67 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.12) and nuclear survivin (nS; HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08) were significantly associated with disease-specific survival (DSS). In the cohort of patients with advanced localized or metastasized ccRCC, high staining of Ki67, p53 and nS predicted shorter DSS (Ki67: HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.11; p53: HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09; nS: HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14). In organ-confined ccRCC, patients with high p21-staining had a longer DSS (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-0.99). In a multivariate model with stepwise backward elimination, tumor size and p21-staining showed a significant association with DSS in patients with "organ-confined" ccRCCs. The p21-staining increased the concordance index of tumor size from 0.75 to 0.78. In patients with "organ-confined" ccRCC, no disease-related deaths occurred in the group with p21-expression below the threshold of 32.5% p21-positive cells (log rank test: P=0.002). CONCLUSION: The prognostic information of the studied protein biomarkers depended on anatomic tumor stages, which displayed different acquired biological tumor characteristics. Analysis of prognostic factors within different clinical ccRCC groups could help to enhance their prognostic power. The p21-staining was an independent prognostic factor and increased prognostic accuracy in a predictive model in "organ-confined" ccRCC.

N2  - Acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) is the central biosynthetic precursor for fatty-acid synthesis and protein acetylation. In the conventional view of mammalian cell metabolism, AcCoA is primarily generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through the citrate shuttle and ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol. However, proliferating cells that exhibit aerobic glycolysis and those exposed to hypoxia convert glucose to lactate at near-stoichiometric levels, directing glucose carbon away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty-acid synthesis. Although glutamine is consumed at levels exceeding that required for nitrogen biosynthesis, the regulation and use of glutamine metabolism in hypoxic cells is not well understood. Here we show that human cells use reductive metabolism of alpha-ketoglutarate to synthesize AcCoA for lipid synthesis. This isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate for de novo lipogenesis. Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce AcCoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells.

N1  - Genetics and Neuroimaging.
N2  - The phakomatoses are a diverse set of disorders related principally by a similar tendency to produce patchy manifestations that affect the nervous system and various other tissues. All of the disorders involve the occurrence of benign neoplasms or hamartomatous growths, and all involve the action of a distinct gene that functions as a tumor suppressor. At present, none of the phakomatoses is amenable to effective medical treatment, so management is limited to surveillance and treatment of progressive lesions. The radiologist plays a key role in this management, participating in diagnosis and follow-up of affected patients. As clinical trials are implemented for these disorders, is expected to play an increasingly important role in providing quantifiable endpoints to determine the effectiveness of new therapies.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma may develop in up to 25% of patients with Lindau-von Hippel disease who survive the earlier manifestations of this disease, and this neoplasm may frequently be bilateral. With early detection of such lesions, operative cure of renal cell carcinoma is more likely in these patients. However, some patients may need to undergo bilateral nephrectomy for cure. Such a patient may benefit from cadaver renal transplant in spite of the increased risk of cancer in immunosuppressed patients. We present such a case in a patient with Lindau-von Hippel disease.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare in the pediatric population occurring in approximately 1 in 50,000 children. While some cases are sporadic, they have commonly been associated with syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau, multiple endocrine neoplasia types IIa and IIb, neurofibromatosis type 1, and hereditary pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndromes. In children less than 18 years of age approximately 60% of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are associated with a germline mutation. We present an 11-year-old child with an abdominal paraganglioma related to a succinate dehydrogenase subunit B gene mutation whose father had a previously resected abdominal paraganglioma and was found to carry the same mutation. In addition, we review the etiology, genetics, diagnostic approach, and challenges of preoperative management of secretory pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas in children.

N2  - Von Hippel Lindau disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome, characterized by retinal, spinal, and cerebellar haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, and phaeochromocytomas. Cysts of the kidney and pancreas may also occur. We describe a large three-generation Irish family with VHL disease who initially presented with features typical of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Eight clinically affected individuals were found. Visceral complications were particularly prominent within the family. There were no cases of retinal angiomata or phaeochromocytoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by genetic linkage analysis in this family, although the exact mutation has yet to be defined.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene inactivation is linked to the development of haemangioblastomas in the central nervous system and retina, often in association with other tumours, such as clear-cell carcinomas of the kidney and phaeochromocytomas. Here we show that the VHL protein (pVHL) is a microtubule-associated protein that can protect microtubules from depolymerization in vivo. Both the microtubule binding and stabilization functions of pVHL depend on amino acids 95-123 of pVHL, a mutational 'hot-spot' in VHL disease. From analysis of naturally occurring pVHL mutants, it seems that only point mutations such as pVHL<sup>Y98H</sup> and pVHL<sup>Y112H</sup> (that predispose to haemangioblastoma and phaeochromocytoma, but not to renal cell carcinoma) disrupt pVHL's microtubule-stabilizing function. Our data identify a role for pVHL in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and potentially provide a link between this function of pVHL and the pathogenesis of haemangioblastoma and phaeochromocytoma in the context of VHL disease.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a regulator of metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. It is now appreciated that HIF-1alpha accumulation is achieved under normoxic conditions by various factors, such as TNF-alpha. Here, it was our intention to gain insight into the signaling mechanisms used by TNF-alpha to stimulate HIF-1alpha. In tubular LLC-PK1 or human embryonic kidney cells, TNF-alpha induced accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein but not HIF-1alpha mRNA. Blocking nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB with sulfasalazine or expression of an IkappaB superrepressor attenuated HIF-1alpha accumulation, whereas transfection of active p50/p65-NF-kappaB subunits mimicked a TNF-alpha response. Experiments with actinomycin D and cycloheximide also pointed to a transcriptional and translational process in facilitating the TNF-alpha response. Interestingly, and in contrast to established hypoxic signaling concepts, TNF-alpha elicited HIF-1alpha accumulation in a ubiquitinated form that still bound the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) protein. These data indicate that HIF-1alpha accumulation by TNF-alpha demands the NF-kappaB pathway, preserves ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha, and allows the HIF-1alpha-pVHL interaction.

N2  - Mutations in von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) underlie the VHL hereditary cancer syndrome and also occur in most sporadic clear cell renal cell cancers (CCRCC). Currently, the mechanism(s) by which VHL loss of function promotes tumor development in the kidney are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that VHL inactivation in precancerous lesions in kidneys from patients with VHL disease correlates with marked down-regulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Moreover, in VHL-defective cell lines (RCC4 and RCC10) derived from sporadic CCRCC, reexpression of VHL was found to restore E-cadherin expression. The product of the VHL gene has multiple reported functions, the best characterized of which is its role as the recognition component of an ubiquitin E3 ligase complex responsible for mediating oxygen-dependent destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) subunits. We show that HIF activation is necessary and sufficient to suppress E-cadherin in renal cancer cells. Given the fundamental role of E-cadherin in controlling epithelial behavior, our findings give insight into how VHL inactivation/HIF activation may lead to kidney cancer and also indicate a mechanism by which reduced oxygenation could alter E-cadherin expression in other cancers and influence normal homeostasis in other epithelia.

N2  - HIV-1 integrase, the viral enzyme responsible for provirus integration into the host genome, can be actively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Here, we identify von Hippel-Lindau binding protein 1(VBP1), a subunit of the prefoldin chaperone, as an integrase cellular binding protein that bridges interaction between integrase and the cullin2 (Cul2)-based von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that VBP1 and Cul2/VHL are required for proper HIV-1 expression at a step between integrase-dependent proviral integration into the host genome and transcription of viral genes. Using both an siRNA approach and Cul2/VHL mutant cells, we show that VBP1 and the Cul2/VHL ligase cooperate in the efficient polyubiquitylation of integrase and its subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Results presented here support a role for integrase degradation by the prefoldin-VHL-proteasome pathway in the integration-transcription transition of the viral replication cycle.

N2  - There is evidence that loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene causes transcriptional activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene, which in turn may lead to increased proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that transfer of VHL gene, a tumor suppressor gene, into vascular endothelial cells could cause loss of viability and suppression of its proliferative ability. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were grown as monolayers and transfected with varying titers of adenovirus containing the VHL cDNA (AdVHL). The negative controls used were adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein (AdGFP), vector alone (AdNull), and infection medium without virus. Adenovirus encoding p53 (Adp53) was used as positive control. Cell viability and proliferation were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Our results showed that proliferative activity in HAEC can be blocked and viability of HAEC reduced by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of VHL gene. This is the first time that VHL gene has been effectively transferred to HAEC. VHL gene transfer into the vascular endothelium may have potential in limiting proliferative processes, including intimal hyperplasia.

N2  - In the United States, advanced kidney cancer accounts for over 12,000 deaths each year. Immunotherapy with either interferon or interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been the standard of care for over two decades. High-dose IL-2 can apparently cure 10% to 15% of patients treated, but due to the required inpatient care and the attendant toxicities, it is only administered to less than 1000 patients per year in the United States (Chiron, personal communication). Interferon is a less active agent than IL-2 but it has still been shown to be superior to therapy with either megesterol or vinblastine. Interferon typically resutts in very few long-term responses and is given to most patients with metastatic kidney cancer. Median survival after interferon therapy is dependent on risk group but is typically 12 to 15 months. Thus, new therapies are urgently needed in this refractory disease. Novel compounds currently being tested in clinical trials are showing promise in advanced kidney cancer. The molecular targets of these drugs include interfering with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors or the raf kinase pathway, angiogenesis inhibition, and antimicrotubule agents. A review of the preclinical and early clinical development of some of these novel compounds will be discussed. Copyright Â© 2005 by Current Science Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: Inactivation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) leads to increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and overexpression of HIF target genes, such as VEGF and others. VEGF-targeted agents are standard in advanced clear-cell RCC but biomarkers of activity are lacking. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed tumor tissue samples from metastatic clear-cell RCC patients who received pazopanib as part of clinical trial VEG102616. We evaluated several components of the VHL/HIF pathway: VHL gene inactivation (mutation and/or methylation), HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha immunohistochemistry staining, and HIF-1alpha transcriptional signature. We evaluated the association of these biomarkers with best overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) to pazopanib, a standard first-line VEGF-targeted agent. RESULTS: The VEG102616 trial enrolled 225 patients, from whom 78 samples were available for tumor DNA extraction. Of these, 70 patients had VHL mutation or methylation. VHL gene status did not correlate with ORR or PFS. Similarly, HIF-1alpha (65 samples) and HIF-2alpha (66 samples) protein levels (high vs. low) did not correlate with ORR or PFS to pazopanib. The HIF-1alpha transcriptional signature (46 samples) was enriched in tumors expressing high HIF-1alpha levels. However, the HIF-1alpha gene expression signature was not associated with clinical outcome to pazopanib. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced clear-cell RCC, several potential biomarkers along the VHL/HIF-1alpha/HIF-2alpha axis were not found to be predictive for pazopanib activity. Additional efforts must continue to identify biomarkers associated with clinical outcome to VEGF-targeted agents in metastatic RCC.

N2  - A substantial fraction of glaucoma has a genetic basis. About 5% of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is currently attributed to single-gene or Mendelian forms of glaucoma (ie glaucoma caused by mutations in myocilinor optineurin). Mutations in these genes have a high likelihood of leading to glaucoma and are rarely seen in normal subjects. Other cases of POAG have a more complex genetic basis and are caused by the combined effects of many genetic and environmental risk factors, each of which do not act alone to cause glaucoma. These factors are more frequently detected in patients with POAG, but are also commonly observed in normal subjects. Additional genes that may be important in glaucoma pathogenesis have been investigated using quantitative traits approaches. Such studies have begun to identify genes that control the magnitude of important quantitative features of glaucoma that may also be important risk factors for POAG, such as central corneal thickness. Each of these different approaches to study glaucoma genetics is providing new insights into the pathogenesis of POAG. Â© 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - Generally, patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are viewed as potential candidates for antiangiogenic targeted therapy. Tubulocystic RCC (TCRC) is a recently described entity which may behave aggressively, and the rationale for antiangiogenic therapy in this group of renal tumors has yet to be determined. Seven TCRCs and five non-tumor tissue samples from seven patients were subjected to relative expression analysis of mRNA levels of 16 genes involved in three angiogenic signal pathways: (1) VHL/HIF, (2) RTK/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and (3) PI3K/Akt/mTOR. Two of them, pathways (2) and (3), are often targeted by antiangiogenic agents. We also determined the mutation and methylation status of the VHL gene. Finally, the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha proteins, and phosphorylated mTOR protein were also determined. The comparison of tumor and control samples revealed no changes of mRNA levels of the following genes: VHL, HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, PTEN, Akt2, Akt3, mTOR, VEGFA, KDR, HRas, C-Jun, EGFR, and FGF2. Significantly elevated mRNA level of TP53 was found, while the mRNA levels of FLT1 and C-FOS were reduced in tumor samples. No mutations or methylation in the VHL gene were found. Changes in levels of studied proteins VEGFA, HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, and increased phosphorylation of mTOR protein were not found. Three studied angiogenic pathways (VHL/HIF, RTK/MAPK, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR) seem not to be upregulated in TCRC samples, so there appears to be no rationale for a general recommendation of antiangiogenic targeted therapeutic protocols for patients with these tumors.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by germ-line mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene and is the most common cause of inherited renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Mutations in the VHL gene also occur in a large majority of sporadic cases of clear-cell RCC, which have high intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Here we show that VHL-deficient RCC cells express lower levels of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BIM(EL) and are more resistant to etoposide and UV radiation-induced death compared to the same cells stably expressing the wild-type VHL protein (pVHL). Reintroducing pVHL into VHL-null cells increased the half-life of BIM(EL) protein without affecting its mRNA expression, and overexpressing pVHL inhibited BIM(EL) polyubiquitination. Suppressing pVHL expression with RNA interference resulted in a decrease in BIM(EL) protein and a corresponding decrease in the sensitivity of RCC cells to apoptotic stimuli. Directly inhibiting BIM(EL) expression in pVHL-expressing RCC cells caused a similar decrease in cell death. These results demonstrate that pVHL acts to promote BIM(EL) protein stability in RCC cells, and that destabilization of BIM(EL) in the absence of pVHL contributes to the increased resistance of VHL-null RCC cells to certain apoptotic stimuli.

N2  - CASE REPORT: We report a young girl who first presented with a unilateral total exudative retinal detachment diagnosed as Coats' disease. Eight years later, when she presented with classical retinal hemangioblastomas with reduced vision in the fellow eye, the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease was confirmed. COMMENTS: This case highlights the importance of considering the possibility of VHL in atypical cases of Coats' disease and unusual sporadic cases of unexplained unilateral exudative retinal detachment. The identification of VHL mutations and subsequent screening allows early diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic retinal or central nervous system hemangioblastomas, as well as other malignancies associated with this syndrome.

N2  - The "phakomatosis" concept was formulated early in the twentieth century by the ophthalmologist van der Hoeve. He included 3 disorders in the group-neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome--on the basis of the occurrence of patchy ophthalmologic manifestations in each disorder. Since the name was coined, much has been learned about the pathogenesis of these 3 disorders. It is clear that 2 of them--neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis--are collective terms for multiple disorders. Each of the conditions is caused by distinct genetic defects, with little commonality in terms of protein function. Yet, in some respects, the disorders share a pathogenetic mechanism, that of the tumor suppressor gene. This review will briefly describe these disorders in light of what has been learned about underlying molecular pathogenesis. In each case, genetic testing is beginning to be available; principles of the use of genetic tests will be described. [References: 85]

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of transforming growth factor-beta-induced (TGFBI) in metastasis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the associations between TGFBI expression and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) status. METHODS: In null type VHL cells stably transfected with the VHL vector, the expression of VHL in cells with wild type VHL was decreased by siRNA. We investigated the effects of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) on TGFBI in RCC cells by decreasing the expression levels of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha through siRNA. The secretion of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in RCC cells with different VHL status was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The role of TGFBI in metastasis and the effect of VHL activation on TGFBI-induced adhesion, migration, and invasion in RCC cells were examined using matrigel, chemotaxis, and the transwell system, respectively. RESULTS: Our results suggested that TGF-beta1 and TGFBI might be targets of VHL, and the suppression of TGFBI by VHL is not by way of the HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha pathway. The expression of TGFBI was significantly enhanced by TGF-beta1 in VHL-inactive RCC cells compared with VHL-active cells. In addition, these results indicate that TGFBI participated in the adhesion, migration, and invasion of RCC cells, which are dependent on the inactivation of VHL. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that TGFBI-promoted metastasis of RCC cells depends on inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor and that TGFBI could be a therapeutic target against RCC in the future.

N2  - The signalling components upstream and downstream of the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are frequently altered in a wide variety of human diseases. Upstream of mTOR key signalling molecules are the small GTPase Ras, the lipid kinase PI3K, the Akt kinase, and the GTPase Rheb, which are known to be deregulated in many human cancers. Mutations in the mTOR pathway component genes TSC1, TSC2, LKB1, PTEN, VHL, NF1 and PKD1 trigger the development of the syndromes tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Lhermitte-Duclos disease, Proteus syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, Neurofibromatosis type 1, and Polycystic kidney disease, respectively. In addition, the tuberous sclerosis proteins have been implicated in the development of several sporadic tumors and in the control of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, known to be of relevance for several cancers. Recently, it has been recognized that mTOR is regulated by TNF-alpha and Wnt, both of which have been shown to play critical roles in the development of many human neoplasias. In addition to all these human diseases, the role of mTOR in Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed. [References: 115]

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review will examine the recent advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular events that shape this cancer, and overview the emerging targeted therapies that have altered the landscape for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of RCC continues to rise, making it the 7th and 8th most common cancer among men and women in the US, respectively. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene loss is an important factor in the development of clear cell RCC, however: loss of VHL can result in tumors which express both HIF1 and HIF2, or HIF2 alone, correlating with distinct pathway activities. Invasive tumors demonstrating loss of VHL consistently demonstrate additional genetic changes, which appear to be essential for tumor progression. Targeted therapies have demonstrated improvements in overall survival. New ways to radiographically measure the tumor response to these treatments may provide additional information about a drug's activity in an individual patient. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are still being investigated in the adjuvant setting. SUMMARY: The field of RCC biology continues to rapidly change. As new targeted strategies to control this cancer evolve, so do both the clinical strategies, and the strategies to measure response and predict outcome. [References: 38]

N2  - Background: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of changes in the diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma in a pediatric population. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of all children who had resection of pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma at a major children's hospital since 1968. Results: Fifteen children underwent surgery at 11.9 +/- 4.2 years of age. Presenting symptoms included headache, hypertension, and sweating. Three children had a mutation of the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme, and 1 child had nonsyndromic, familial pheochromocytoma. The most sensitive diagnostic modalities included 24-hour urinary and plasma norepinephrine and 24-hour urinary total metanephrines, magnetic resonance imaging, and <sup>123</sup>I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy. Laparoscopic cortical-sparing adrenalectomy was performed in 3 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Compared with those with open procedures (n = 7), patients who had laparoscopic resection (n = 5) had a statistically shorter hospital length of stay, and time to eating ambulation. Conclusions: The addition of <sup>123</sup>I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine scanning, genetic testing, and laparoscopic surgery has changed the diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma in children. Laparoscopic cortical-sparing adrenalectomy can be accomplished safely and is the preferred treatment for children at risk for multifocal disease. Â© 2007 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein function results in an autosomal-dominant cancer syndrome known as VHL disease, which manifests as angiomas of the retina, hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, renal clear-cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas. VHL tumor suppressor is a specific substrate-recognition component of the E3 ubiquitin complex, which regulates proteasomal degradation of the alpha subunit of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF). Impaired VHL complex function leads to accumulation of HIF, overexpression of various HIF-induced gene products and formation of highly vascular neoplasia. However, the ubiquitylating role of the VHL complex extends beyond its function in regulating HIF, as it appears to regulate the stability of other proteins that might be involved in various steps of oncogenic processes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Acute mountain sickness (AMS) has become a significant environmental health issue as improvements in transportation, "environmental tourism," and resource development lure more people to the highlands. Whether there is a genetic contribution to AMS susceptibility is a central question in high-altitude medicine. This article provides a systematic review of the evidence supporting such an innate predisposition. METHODS: Scientific literature databases were screened using the terms "acute mountain sickness/AMS" and "altitude illness" combined with the terms "DNA," "gene," "genetic," or "polymorphism." RESULTS: Sixteen genes from a variety of pathways have been tested for association with AMS and variants in eight showed positive associations suggesting that AMS is an environmentally mediated polygenic disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that genotype contributes to capacity to rapidly and efficiently acclimatize to altitude; nevertheless, the mechanisms by which this occurs have yet to be elucidated.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) develop from the adrenal medulla and are often part of a hereditary syndrome such as von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. In VHL, only about 30 % of patients with a VHL missense mutation develop PCCs. Thus, additional genetic events leading to formation of such tumors in patients with VHL syndrome are sought. SDHAF2 (previously termed SDH5) and SDHD are both located on chromosome 11q and are required for the function of mitochondrial complex II. While SDHAF2 has been shown to be mutated in patients with paragangliomas (PGLs), SDHD mutations have been found both in patients with PCCs and in patients with PGLs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Because loss of 11q is a common event in VHL-associated PCCs, we aimed to investigate whether SDHAF2 and SDHD are targets. In the present study, 41 VHL-associated PCCs were screened for mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in SDHAF2 or SDHD. Promoter methylation, as well as mRNA expression of SDHAF2 and SDHD, was studied. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) of SDHB, known to be a universal marker for loss of any part the SDH complex, was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: LOH was found in more than 50 % of the VHL-associated PCCs, and was correlated with a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in both SDHAF2 and SDHD mRNA expression, which may be suggestive of a pathogenic role. However, while SDHB protein expression as determined by IHC in a small cohort of tumors was lower in PCCs than in the surrounding adrenal cortex, there was no obvious correlation with LOH or the level of SDHAF2/SDHD mRNA expression. In addition, the lack of mutations and promoter methylation in the investigated samples indicates that other events on chromosome 11 might be involved in the development of PCCs in association with VHL syndrome.

N2  - Solitary or multiple supratentorial haemangioblastomas are rare and may be associated with Von Hippel Lindau complex (VHLC), polycythaemia or a family history of VHLC. An extensive review of the literature (1902-1992) has revealed 112 cases. They account for 2-8% of all haemangioblastomas and are commonly intraparenchymatous (86.8%) and infrequently intraventricular (6.6%). However, a meningeal location 5.6%) is extremely rare. Only one case of a solitary leptomeningeal haemangioblastoma has previously been reported and this was associated with a family and personal history of VHLC, cerebellar haemangioblastoma and renal carcinoma. We report a solitary solid left parietal leptomeningeal haemangioblastoma mimicking a meningioma or a secondary deposit on computed tomography in a 72-year-old male. There were no manifestations of or a family history of VHLC or polycythaemia. [References: 21]

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) induction and associated transcription were investigated during high cell density, focusing on the negative regulator of HIF-1alpha expression, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. In 293T and HeLa cells, HIF-1alpha protein levels and associated transcription were induced as cells approached confluence. To determine whether these changes were due to a deficit in nuclear VHL-mediated ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha at confluence, cells were stably transfected with VHL. Overexpression of VHL in 293T cells had no demonstrable effect on the induction and nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha during high cell density or associated transcription. Moreover, RCC cells stably transfected with full-length VHL failed to exhibit the cell-density-dependent induction of HIF-1alpha noted in other cell lines. Investigation of both N-terminal and C-terminal (aa 727-826) oxygen-regulated proline and asparagine hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha revealed that both are inhibited during high cell density, as determined by impaired capture of HIF-1alpha by VHL and enhanced C-terminal transactivation. Finally, cell-density-mediated induction of HIF-1alpha and GLUT1 in RCC cells could be completely reconstituted by mutations in VHL binding affinity, suggesting that cell-density dependent induction of HIF-1alpha and transactivation may underpin some of the deregulated gene expression observed in VHL disease.

N2  - Zebrafish studies in the past two decades have made major contributions to our understanding of hematopoiesis and its associated disorders. The zebrafish has proven to be a powerful organism for studies in this area owing to its amenability to large-scale genetic and chemical screening. In addition, the externally fertilized and transparent embryos allow convenient genetic manipulation and in vivo imaging of normal and aberrant hematopoiesis. This review discusses available methods for studying hematopoiesis in zebrafish, summarizes key recent advances in this area, and highlights the current and potential contributions of zebrafish to the discovery and development of drugs to treat human blood disorders.

N2  - Appropriate use of multiple reliable molecular biomarkers in the right context will play a role in tailormade medicine of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients in the future. A total of 11,056 patients from 53 studies were included in this review. The article numbers of the each evidence levels, using the grading system defined by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine, in 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3b were 5 (9%), 18 (34%), 29 (55%), and 1 (2%), respectively. The main goal of using biomarkers is to refine predictions of tumor progression, pharmacotherapy responsiveness, and cancer-specific and/or overall survival. Currently, carbonic anhydrase (CA9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in peripheral blood and p53 in tumor tissues are measured to predict metastasis, while VEGF-related proteins in peripheral blood are used to assess pharmacotherapy responsiveness with sunitinib. Furthermore, interleukin 8, osteopontin, hepatocyte growth factor, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 in peripheral blood enable assessment of responsiveness to pazopanib treatment. Other reliable molecular biomarkers include von Hippel-Lindau gene alteration, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, CA9, and survivin in tumor tissues and VEGF in peripheral blood for predicting cancer-specific survival. In the future, studies should undergo external validation for developing tailored management of clear cell RCC with molecular biomarkers, since individual institutional studies lack the generalization and consistency required to maintain accuracy among different patient series.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau disease is caused by inactivating germline mutations of the VHL tumour suppressor gene and is associated with an increased risk of a variety of tumours in an allele-specific manner. The role of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in the pathogenesis of VHL-defective tumours has been more firmly established during the past 5 years. In addition, there is now a greater appreciation of HIF-independent VHL functions that are relevant to tumour development, including maintenance of the primary cilium, regulation of extracellular matrix formation and turnover, and modulation of cell death in certain cell types following growth factor withdrawal or in response to other forms of stress.

N2  - In this study, we focus on different modes of regulation of STRA13, a human ortholog of the mouse basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factor, previously identified by us as a new von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) target. The gene was overexpressed in VHL-deficient cell lines and tumors, specifically clear cell renal carcinomas and hemangioblastomas. Introduction of wild type VHL transgene into clear cell renal carcinoma restored low level expression of STRA13. Overexpression was also detected in many common malignancies with an intact VHL gene, suggesting the existence of another, VHL-independent pathway of STRA13 regulation. Similar to many other von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein (pVHL) targets, the expression of STRA13 on the mRNA level was hypoxia-sensitive, indicating oxygen-dependent regulation of the gene, presumably through the pVHL/hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway. The yeast two-hybrid screening revealed interaction of the STRA13 protein with the human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC9) protein, the specificity of which was confirmed in mammalian cells. By adding the proteasome inhibitor acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal, we demonstrated that the 26 S proteasome pathway regulates the stability of pSTRA13. Co-expression of STRA13 and UBC9 led to an increase of the pSTRA13 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. These data established that UBC9/STRA13 association in cells is of physiological importance, presenting direct proof of UBC9 involvement in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of pSTRA13. Hypoxia treatment of mammalian cells transiently expressing STRA13 protein showed that stability of pSTRA13 is not affected by hypoxia or VHL. Thus, STRA13, a new pVHL target, is regulated in cells on multiple levels. We propose that STRA13 may play a critical role in carcinogenesis, since it is a potent transcriptional regulator, abundant in a variety of common tumors.

N2  - Genetic aspects of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease were studied in familial and isolated cases. Complex segregation analysis with pointers was performed in 38 kindreds with two or more affected members. Dominant inheritance with almost complete penetrance in the highest age classes (0.96 at 51 to 60 and 0.99 at 61 to 70 years) was confirmed and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between families ascertained through complete and incomplete selection. The point prevalence of heterozygotes in East Anglia was 1.89/100,000 (1/53,000) persons with an estimated birth incidence of 2.73/100,000 (1/36,000) live births. Reproductive fitness was 0.83. Direct and indirect estimates of the mutation rate were 4.4 (95% CI 0.9 to 7.9) x 10(-6)/gene/generation and 2.32 x 10(-6)/gene/generation respectively. There was no significant association between parental age or birth order and new mutations for VHL disease.

N2  - Phaeochromocytoma is a rare, usually benign, tumour predominantly managed by endocrinologists. Over the last decade, major advances have been made in understanding the molecular genetic basis of adrenal and extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma (also referred to as adrenal phaeochromocytoma (aPCA) and extra-adrenal functional paraganglioma (eFPGL)). In contrast to the previously held belief that only 10% of cases had a genetic component, currently about one-third of all aPCA/eFPGL cases are thought to be attributable to germline mutations in at least nine genes (NF1, RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, TMEM127, MAX and VHL). Recognition of inherited cases of aPCA/eFPGL is critical for optimal patient management. Thus, the identification of a germline mutation can predict risks of malignancy, recurrent disease, associated non-chromaffin tumours and risks to other family members. Mutation carriers should be offered specific surveillance programmes (according to the relevant gene). In this review, we will describe the genetics of aPCA/eFPGL and strategies for genetic testing.

N2  - Purpose: The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is often inactivated (by mutation or promoter hypermethylation) in renal cell carcinoma but the relation to therapeutic outcome is unclear. Materials and Methods: Patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma with available baseline tumor samples who received vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy were included in analysis. Patient characteristics, VHL gene status and clinical outcome were documented. Our primary end point was to test for response rate in relation to VHL inactivation. Progression-free survival and overall survival in relation to VHL status were investigated as secondary end points. Results: A total of 123 patients were evaluable. Response rate, median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 37% (95% CI 28-46), 10.8 (95% CI 7.7-14.8) and 29.8 (CI not estimable) months, respectively. Patients with VHL inactivation had a response rate of 41% vs 31% for those with wild-type VHL (p = 0.34). Patients with loss of function mutations (frameshift, nonsense, splice and in-frame deletions/insertions) had a 52% response rate vs 31% with wild-type VHL (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis the presence of a loss of function mutation remained an independent prognostic factor associated with improved response. Progression-free survival and overall survival were not significantly different based on VHL status. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the largest analysis investigating the impact of VHL inactivation on the outcome of vascular endothelial growth factor targeted agents in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We did not find a statistically significant increase in response to vascular endothelial growth factor targeted agents in patients with VHL inactivation. Loss of function mutations identified a population of patients with a greater response. Investigation of downstream markers is under way. Â© 2008 American Urological Association.

N2  - Germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes, or less frequently oncogenes, have been identified in up to 19 familial cancer syndromes including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial paraganglioma, familial adenomatous polyposis coli and breast and ovarian cancers. Multiple genes have been associated with some syndromes as approximately 26 genes have been linked to the development of these familial cancers. With this increased knowledge of the molecular determinants of familial cancer comes an equal expectation for efficient genetic screening programs. We have trialled denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) as a tool for rapid germline mutation scanning of genes implicated in three familial cancer syndromes -- Cowden syndrome (PTEN mutation), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (RET mutation) and von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL mutation). Thirty-two mutations, including 21 in PTEN, 9 in RET plus a polymorphism, and 2 in VHL, were analyzed using the WAVE DNA fragment analysis system with 100% detection efficiency. In the case of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, mutations were scattered along most of the gene. However, mutations in the RET proto-oncogene associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 were limited to specific clusters or "hot spots." The use of GC-clamped primers to scan for mutations scattered along PTEN exons was shown to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detection of mutant hetero- and homoduplex peaks at a single denaturation temperature compared to fragments generated using non--GC-clamped primers. Thus, when scanning tumor suppressor genes for germline mutation using dHPLC, the incorporation of appropriate GC-clamped primers will likely increase the efficiency of mutation detection.

N2  - We have shown that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is a survival factor for human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and that its expression is negatively regulated by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene at the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, as observed for tumor growth factors (TGFs). Our goals were to analyze the alternative splicing of PTHrP mRNA in human RCC and from these results to identify VHL/hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) system-regulated mRNA-binding proteins involved in PTHrP mRNA stability. We used: (i) a panel of human RCC cells expressing or not VHL; (ii) VHL-deficient 786-0 cells transfected with active or inactive VHL and (iii) human RCC samples and corresponding normal tissues. By quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, the 141 PTHrP mRNA isoform was found to be predominant in all cells and tumors (80%). In cells transfected with VHL, the expressions of all isoforms were decreased by 50%. Eight proteins with molecular weights ranging from 20 to 75 kDa were found to bind to biotinylated transcripts spanning the 141 PTHrP mRNA AU-rich 3'-untranslated region whose abundancy was dependent on VHL expression. The protein having an apparent molecular weight of 30 kDa was identified by western blot as HuR, a RNA-binding protein with stabilizing functions on various mRNA coding for proteins important in malignant transformation including vascular endothelial growth factor and TGF-beta. PTHrP expression studies confirmed the involvement of HuR in PTHrP upregulation in this disease. Common mRNA-binding proteins regulated by the VHL/HIF system may constitute new therapeutic opportunities against human RCC that remains refractory to therapies.

N2  - In renal cell carcinomas (RCC), NF-kappaB blockade is required for maximal bortezomib-induced apoptosis, and expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein downregulates NF-kappaB. Thus, we hypothesized that expression of wild-type (wt) VHL sensitizes RCC cells to bortezomib by reducing constitutive NF-kappaB activity. Using isogenic paired cell lines with and without expression of wtVHL, we have confirmed that VHL expression reduces constitutive NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, VHL expression confers markedly heightened sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of bortezomib in vitro. The bortezomib IC50 values were greater than two logs lower in the VHL-expressing cell lines compared to the VHL-deficient counterparts. By manipulating the level of constitutive NF-kappaB activity in an isogenic pair of RCC cell lines independently of VHL expression, we were able to demonstrate that the VHL sensitization effect is due to downregulation of NF-kappaB activity. These findings offer the enticing possibility of using VHL status as a molecular marker to identify RCC patients who may be sensitive to bortezomib. In particular, RCC patients who have non-clear-cell histologies as well as approximately 25% of clear-cell RCCs manifest expression of wtVHL and represent a subpopulation of patients that is apt to respond to bortezomib.

N2  - Familial catecholamine secreting tumors have been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, Von Hippel-Lindau disease and neurofibromatosis type 1. In the last years, mutations of genes encoding subunits B, C and D of the succinate dehydrogenase have been discovered as other causes of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We diagnosed a malignant retroperitoneal paraganglioma in a 64-yr-old man with bone metastasis in 2001. Two years later a retroperitoneal benign paraganglioma was found and resected in his 32-yr-old daughter. Thus we diagnosed in this family a paraganglioma syndrome. We performed molecular genetic analyses of the genes SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. We detected in the SDHB gene the mutation SDHB c. 558-3 C> G affecting the splice site of exon 5. In a second daughter the mutation was also detected, thorough clinical investigation revealed normal results. We conclude that the SDHB mutation predisposes to abdominal extra-adrenal and potential malignant pheochromocytoma with incomplete penetrance.

N2  - The incidence of kidney cancer is gradually increasing, with a rate of 2-3% per decade. The kidney develops various kinds of neoplasms, some of which are associated with familial cancer syndromes. Such cases have provided clues to identify the cancer-responsible genes. In 2004, the World Health Organization published a new classification system of renal neoplasms, incorporating recent knowledge obtained in the cytogenetic and molecular biological fields, i.e. genes responsible for each histologic subtype (von Hippel-Lindau for clear cell renal cell carcinoma, c-met for papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1, etc.). Subsequently, the Japanese classification system in 'the General Rule for Clinicopathological Study of Renal Cell Carcinoma' has been revised as the 4th edition, according to the World Health Organization system. Several novel subtypes have been introduced, i.e. mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, and Xp11.2/TFE3 translocation-associated renal cell carcinoma. Even after the publication of the classification, other novel subtypes have emerged, i.e. acquired cystic disease-associated renal cell carcinoma and tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma. Additionally, some of the subtypes seem to form families based on morphological transition, immunohistochemical features and gene expression profile. In future, the classification of renal cell carcinoma should be reorganized on the basis of molecular biological characteristics to establish personalized therapeutic strategies.

N2  - This review describes the role that epigenetic changes play in the pathogenesis of cancer, concentrating on the plasma cell malignancy multiple myeloma, and highlights recent findings regarding the efficacy of epigenetic therapeutic agents in laboratory studies and clinical trials. DNA methylation is altered in a wide range of cancers with hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Genes found to be silenced by methylation in myeloma samples include VHL, TP53, CDKN2A, and TGFBR2. Myeloma is linked to the overexpression of a histone methylatransferase (MMSET) and inactivating mutations of a histone demethylase (UTX), suggesting that the regulation of histone methylation is a potential therapeutic target. Abnormal expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been widely described in solid tumours and haematological malignancies. In myeloma, histone deacetylase inhibitors show promising results both in laboratory-based cell culture studies and in clinical trials, where they demonstrate particularly good therapeutic outcome when administered in combination with other standard chemotherapeutic agents. The study of epigenetics shows great promise for understanding the alterations in gene expression that underlie malignancies and provides exciting novel drugable targets.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) is best known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). VHL mutations are the genetic defects underlying several human diseases including polycythemia, familial VHL tumor syndrome and sporadic renal cell carcinoma. VHL mutations can lead to cell-autonomous phenotypes in the tumor cells. However, non-tumor cell-autonomous functions of VHL have also been noted. VHL tumor-derived cytokines can promote inflammation and induce mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells. Up-regulation of HIF caused by VHL loss-of-function mutants, including heterozygotes, has been shown to increase the activities of hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial cells and myeloid cells. As such, systemic functions of VHL likely play important roles in the development of VHL disease. Â© 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - A better understanding of the molecular biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the emergence of molecular targeted drugs have revolutionized the treatment for patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC). Multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib and sunitinib) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus) have recently shown superiority over interferon-alpha or placebo. However, while the molecular targeted drugs have demonstrated encouraging results, these drugs have also sometimes induced unexpected adverse events. Control of adverse events is important to obtain the maximum effectiveness and sustain quality of life for patients. Because renal pelvic cancer has many similarities in pathogenesis with urinary bladder cancer, the same chemotherapeutic regimen is often proposed for patients with metastatic renal pelvic cancer. Combined chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin is now widely considered to be first-line chemotherapy against these metastatic diseases; however, there are still unresolved problems with this treatment, including the limited survival benefit. To select new therapeutic modalities, a more profound understanding of the molecular biology of renal pelvic cancer is crucial. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence supporting the role and activities of new chemotherapeutic agents and to reveal potential future directions in the management of mRCC and renal pelvic cancer.

N2  - We identified a germline missense mutation at nucleotide 505 (T to C) of the VHL tumor suppressor gene in 14, apparently unrelated, VHL type 2A families from the Black Forest region of Germany. This mutation was previously identified in two VHL 2A families living in Pennsylvania (USA). All affected individuals in the 16 families shared the same VHL haplotype indicating a founder effect. This missense mutation at codon 169 (Tyr to His) would probably cause an alteration in the structure of the putative VHL protein. The association of this distinct mutation with the pheochromocytoma phenotype in VHL may help to elucidate the genetic mechanism of carcinogenesis in this multi tumor cancer syndrome.

N2  - Until recently, patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) had very few therapeutic options. Cytokine therapy, consisting mainly of interferon-alpha and interleukin-2, was considered the mainstay of therapy. A better understanding of the biology of RCC has led to the development of novel therapeutic agents that target angiogenesis. Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour-suppressor gene VHL, which is present in the vast majority of clear-cell RCC tumours, leads to overexpression of the vascular endothelial growth factor, which in turn promotes angiogenesis. Recent observations from a number of positive studies with agents such as sunitinib malate, sorafenib, temsirolimus and bevacizumab have led to a rapid and exciting change in the standard of care for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. This article reviews these agents in the context of their use in clinical practice and provides suggestions about the appropriateness of various agents in specific clinical situations.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited multisystem familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p25. A wide variety of neoplastic processes are known to be associated with VHL disease. The consequences of the VHL mutations and the pathway for tumor development continue to be elucidated. This paper will detail the variety of tumors associated with VHL disease and discuss the genetic mechanisms that lead to the predisposition for neoplasia. [References: 69]

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that mediates the adaptive responses to hypoxia by effecting the transcription of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes. HIF is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors, and the transactivation of HIF targets in transformed cells provides a distinct survival advantage. Accordingly, the upregulation of HIF correlates with increased progression or aggressiveness of the cancer and poor prognosis. In addition to the induction of HIF by hypoxia, its expression is induced by the loss of tumor suppressors VHL, PTEN, TSC1/2, PML, and SDH, as well as by the increased activity of PI3K and/or MAPK signaling pathways, underscoring the significance of HIF in oncogenesis.

N2  - PURPOSE AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Previously, we observed that the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK1) is mediated through the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) as a result of the reactive oxygen species-mediated dissociation of glutaredoxin and thioredoxin from ASK1. In this study, we examined whether p38 MAPK and JNK1 are involved in the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) during ischemia. Human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cells were exposed to low glucose (0.1 mmol/L) with hypoxia (0.1% O(2)). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: During ischemia, p38 MAPK and JNK1 were activated in MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. The activated p38 MAPK, but not JNK1, phosphorylated HIF-1alpha. Data from in vivo binding assay of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein with HIF-1alpha suggests that the p38-mediated phosphorylation of HIF-1alpha contributed to the inhibition of HIF-1alpha and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein interaction during ischemia. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, inhibited HIF-1alpha accumulation during ischemia, probably resulting from the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1alpha.

N2  - Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant multisystem neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas distributed throughout the body, skin, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs. Two-thirds of patients represent sporadic mutations. The classic triad is seizures, mental retardation, and cutaneous angiofibromas. However, the full triad occurs in only 29% of patients; 6% of them lack all three of them. Two tumor suppressor genes responsible for TSC have been identified: TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 and TSC2 on chromosome 16. This article highlights the most recent significant advances in the diagnosis and genetics of TSC, along with a discussion on the limitations and the usefulness of the revised 1998 clinical criteria for the tuberous sclerosis complex. The "ash leaf" macule often comes in other shapes, such as round; most are polygonal, usually 0.5 cm to 2.0 cm in diameter, resembling a thumbprint. Since the death of its describer, Thomas Fitzpatrick, we call each a "Fitzpatrick patch." Special attention is paid in this work to TSC treatment options, including therapeutic trials with rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Learning objective: After completing this learning activity, participants should familiar with tuberous sclerosis complex, its cutaneous signs and systemic findings stratified by patient age, its genetics, and the potential for meaningful therapeutic intervention.

N2  - Mutations or loss of both alleles of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene has been documented in sporadic renal cell carcinomas and neoplasms that arise in individuals having the VHL syndrome. The well-vascularized phenotype of tumors that form in VHL disease let us consider vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a mediator of tumor growth in VHL disease. Human renal carcinoma cells that either lacked endogenous wild-type VHL or were transfected with an inactive mutant VHL showed deregulated expression of VEGF on the mRNA and protein level that was reverted by introduction of wild-type VHL. Stimulation of proliferation of endothelial cells by conditioned medium of cells expressing mutant VHL was almost abolished by neutralizing the VEGF. In contrast, expression of basic fibroblast growth factor and of c-myc proto-oncogene was not affected by VHL. Our data suggest VEGF as the key tumor angiogenesis factor in VHL disease.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and targets hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) for ubiquitylation and degradation under normoxic conditions. pVHL also directly inhibits HIF-1alpha transactivation by recruiting histone deacetylases. Here, we report a novel pVHL-interacting protein that functions as a negative regulator of HIF-1alpha transactivation. This protein, generated from the ZnF197 locus by alternative splicing, contains a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-A domain and a SCAN domain, but lacks the 22 C2H2-type zinc fingers present in ZnF197. Therefore, we named this protein pVHL-associated KRAB-A domain-containing protein (VHLaK). We demonstrate that the KRAB-A domain in VHLaK mediates pVHL binding and functions as a transcriptional repression module. The SCAN domain mediates VHLaK homo-oligomerization, which enhances VHLaK repressive activity. pVHL can recruit VHLaK to repress HIF-1alpha transcriptional activity and HIF-1alpha-induced VEGF expression. Finally, we demonstrate that pVHL, VHLaK and KAP1/TIF-1beta can be recruited into a single complex, indicating that KAP1/TIF-1beta may participate in pVHL-mediated transcriptional repression of HIF-1alpha. Our findings provide a novel mechanism for the modulation of HIF-1alpha transactivation by pVHL.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We report a unique, previously undescribed multigeneration kindred with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease in whom clinical or genetic screening led to the detection of surgically resectable neoplastic disease in several family members. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with VHL disease have a propensity to develop neoplasms of several different organ sites. Retinal angiomas, cerebellar and spinal hemangioblastomas, solid organ cysts, and renal carcinoma are common lesions; pheochromocytomas and pancreatic islet cell tumors occur less frequently but are important causes of morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A detailed pedigree was constructed based on clinical screening and family history that describes the development of pancreatic islet cell tumors in four of five female siblings. VHL mutation analysis was performed in an attempt to determine if genotype-phenotype correlations could be made in this interesting family. RESULTS: The age of onset of VHL-associated neoplasms for three affected siblings was in the third decade of life and in the fourth decade for the fourth sibling. The mother of the four siblings affected with pancreatic tumors developed bilateral pheochromocytomas in the seventh decade of life; she has no pancreatic or kidney tumors. We identified maternal transmission of a missense mutation in codon 238 in exon 3 of the VHL gene in the four affected siblings with pancreatic islet cell tumors. Mutation screening on unaffected family members showed no abnormalities in the VHL gene. Interestingly, one of the four affected siblings had no evidence of VHL on her initial clinical screening evaluation; however, she was followed closely because of her mutated VHL gene. Four years after initial screening, she developed two pancreatic islet cell tumors and a premalignant renal cyst. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and genetic screening for VHL in this family had a significant impact on surgical management by detecting early-stage islet cell tumors or pheochromocytomas. Furthermore, we conclude that the preponderance of pancreatic islet cell tumors in this family cannot be explained by a strict genotype-phenotype correlation. This suggests that additional genetic abnormalities, possibly on chromosome 3p where the VHL gene is located, may be responsible for the variety of VHL-associated neoplasms.

N2  - Patients with hereditary syndromes with renal tumors initially may present to the dermatologist. It is essential that dermatologists recognize these syndromes because the early diagnosis of renal cancer may prove to be lifesaving. The 4 hereditary syndromes with cutaneous manifestations are von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome, tuberous sclerosis (TS), and hereditary leiomyoma renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) syndrome. This article reviews these disorders, emphasizing their cutaneous features and renal manifestations. [References: 34]

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Cowden syndrome, and Proteus syndrome are cancer syndromes which affect multiple organs and lead to significant decline in quality of life in affected patients. These syndromes are rare and typically affect the adolescent and young adult population, resulting in greater cumulative years of life lost. Improved understanding of the underpinnings of the genetic pathways underlying these syndromes and the rapid evolution of targeted therapies in general have made it possible to develop therapeutic options for these patients and other genetic cancer syndromes. Targeted therapies especially antiangiogenics and inhibitors of the PIK3CA/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway have shown activity in selected group of patients affected by these syndromes or in patients harboring specific sporadic mutations which are otherwise characteristic of these syndromes. Unfortunately due to the rare nature, patients with these syndromes are not the focus of clinical trials and unique results seen in these patients can easily go unnoticed. Most of the data suggesting benefits of targeted therapies are either case reports or small case series. Thus, a literature review was indicated. In this review we explore the use of molecularly targeted therapy options in Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Cowden syndrome, and Proteus syndrome.

N2  - About 30% of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma patients harbour a germline mutation in one of the known susceptibility genes and in more than one-third of these patients there is no family history for these tumours. The genetic classification, risk assessment and specific management of the patients and at risk family members play an important role in preventive medicine. Distinct diagnostic or therapeutic approaches related to the genetic testing results are and will be even more relevant in the future for the detection of mutation carriers. In addition to a positive family history, other clinical features such as young age at time of manifestation, multifocal tumours and specific tumour location are highly associated with the presence of a germline mutation - genetic testing in these cases should be mandatory. Since several genes are involved in the genetics of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma, prioritizing which gene(s) to be tested first by using simple clinical information can reduce the efforts and costs of this analysis. The clinicians offering and performing the genetic testing should provide or make available adequate counselling as well as access to preventive and surveillance options to patients. Collaboration with referral centres and research groups in this field can help to coordinate the management of these patients. Â© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk of developing tumors in multiple organs, including eyes, cerebellum, spinal cord, kidneys, inner ear, adrenal glands and pancreas. METHODS: We performed a fundus examination and fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography in both eyes of a young woman affected by VHL with bilateral pheochromocytoma, retinal angioma, retinal microaneurysms and unusual alterations of the deep retinal layers. A molecular analysis of the VHL gene was carried out. RESULTS: Ophthalmoscopy disclosed in her right eye a small retinal hemangioma, some microaneurysms in both eyes at the posterior pole and multiple, small, whitish, dome-shaped lesions scattered in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the posterior retina. Fluorescein angiograms revealed in the early phase multiple hyperfluorescent spots that showed progressive discoloration in the late phase of angiography. Some of these spots were ophthalmoscopically undetectable. The late phase of ICG angiography showed some small hyperfluorescent points located at the level of the RPE, and some of them corresponded to the hyperfluorescent spots seen on fluorescein angiography. The molecular analysis revealed the presence of a "missense" mutation of the VHL gene at nucleotide 683. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in the RPE have never been observed in the VHL syndrome. We describe an unusual case of VHL with a capillary hemangioma associated to diffuse alterations with the RPE of the posterior retina. The possibility exists that these lesions form part of the eye modifications in VHL.

N2  - Here we describe methods developed based on systematic yeast two-hybrid screenings that allowed us to identify several binding partners of HIV-1 integrase. We have developed an efficient strategy to perform large comprehensive screenings with different highly complex cDNA libraries derived both random- and oligo-dT primed reactions. A very efficient mating procedure was used for screening in yeast, allowing genetic saturation of positive clones. This importantly leads with confidence to the determination of the regions within the participating proteins responsible for the interactions. Several additional tools were used that allowed us to assess the specificity of the interactions detected, including rebound screens with cellular co-factors as baits performed against a library of random fragments of HIV-1 proviral DNA. For some of the identified cell factors, we have generated and characterized loss of affinity mutants of integrase, which, when combined with viral functional assays, validated the involvement of human lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) in the integration step of the HIV-1 replication cycle. All tolled, our studies identified LEDGF/p75, Transportin-SR2 (TNPO3), von Hippel-Lindau binding protein 1 (VBP1), and sucrose non-fermenting 5 (SNF5) as cellular binding partners of HIV-1 integrase.

N2  - The Von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) is a tumor suppressor gene, which is widely expressed in kidney, lung, breast, ovary, and cervix. VHL gene mutations can induce VHL disease and tumorigenesis. However, whether this gene is expressed in the human fallopian tube has not been evaluated. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether the VHL gene is expressed in human fallopian tube, and to investigate its expression changes during the menstrual cycle. Twenty-seven patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy with adnexectomy for benign uterine disease were enrolled in the study. Human fallopian tubes were divided into proliferative stage (n=14) and secretory stage (n=13) according to the stage of the menstrual cycle they were isolated from. The expression of the VHL gene and protein was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The results revealed positive expression of the VHL protein in the cytoplasm of ciliated cells of the human fallopian tube. The mRNA and protein expression of VHL in the fallopian tubes was higher in the proliferative compared to the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, but this difference was not significant (P>0.05). Overall, this study presents data on the VHL mRNA and protein expression in the human fallopian tube, which may be relevant to the process of differentiation of ciliated and secretory cells.

N2  - The first congenital defect of hypoxia-sensing homozygosity for VHL 598C>T mutation was recently identified in Chuvash polycythemia. Subsequently, we found this mutation in 11 unrelated individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds. To address the question of whether the VHL 598C>T substitution occurred in a single founder or resulted from recurrent mutational events in human evolution, we performed haplotype analysis of 8 polymorphic markers covering 340 kb spanning the VHL gene on 101 subjects bearing the VHL 598C>T mutation, including 72 homozygotes (61 Chuvash and 11 non-Chuvash) and 29 heterozygotes (11 Chuvash and 18 non-Chuvash), and 447 healthy unrelated individuals from Chuvash and other ethnic groups. The differences in allele frequencies for each of the 8 markers between 447 healthy controls (598C) and 101 subjects bearing the 598T allele (P < 10(-7)) showed strong linkage disequilibrium. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. We conclude that the VHL 598C>T mutation, the most common defect of congenital polycythemia yet found, was spread from a single founder 1,000 to 62,000 years ago.

N2  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor (VPF), is a key mediator of angiogenesis for both physiological and pathological conditions. It is well established that the hypoxic induction of VPF/VEGF is in large part an increase in the stability of its mRNA. A Hu family ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR has recently been shown to be important for VPF/VEGF mRNA stabilization. In renal cancer cells, the inactivation of the tumor suppressor protein von Hippel Lindau (VHL) leads to an increase in VPF/VEGF expression. VHL not only inhibits the transcription of VPF/VEGF but also plays a significant role in decreasing its mRNA stability. Here we delineate a possible mechanism by which VHL can control the function of HuR in order to regulate the stability of VPF/VEGF mRNA. The experiments presented here suggest that the association of the elongin-binding domain of VHL with a specific RNA-binding domain of HuR (RRM1) is important for the destabilizing function of VHL on VPF/VEGF mRNA.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a highly vascularized tumor type, which is often associated with inactivated mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene that drives proangiogenic signaling pathways. As such, new therapies for the treatment of RCC have largely been focused on blocking angiogenesis. Sunitinib, an antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the most frequently used first-line drug for the treatment of RCC. Although treatment with sunitinib improves patient outcome considerably, acquired resistance will emerge in all cases. The molecular mechanisms of resistance to sunitinib are poorly understood, but in the past decade, several of these have been proposed. Lysosomal sequestration of sunitinib was reported as a potential resistance mechanism to sunitinib. In this review, the underlying molecular mechanisms of lysosomal sunitinib sequestration and the potential strategies to overcome this resistance are discussed to be able to further improve the treatment of RCC.

N1  - Renal Cell Carcinoma.
N2  - Renal epithelial neoplasms are morphologically diverse and are characterized by distinct genetic abnormalities. In addition, our understanding of these morphologic differences has allowed us to develop a classification scheme that is more in keeping with their clinical behavior. Clear cell carcinoma is the most common type of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and accounts for the majority of cases that develop metastatic disease. Papillary carcinoma does not constitute a single morphologic, clinical, or genetic entity with some variants being highly aggressive while others are quite indolent. Chromophobe RCC constitutes less than 10% of primary cases and appears to have a more indolent behavior than clear cell or papillary carcinoma. Oncocytomas are benign, but some cases may be difficult to distinguish from eosinophilic variants of chromophobe RCC. RCC, type unclassified, constitutes up to 7% of cases and represents a histologically and clinically heterogeneous category of tumors that does not fit neatly into any of the other well-defined categories. We have entered the era in which pathologists apply their expertise in microscopy and in evaluating antigenic expression in complex cellular systems to aid in the development and characterization of targeted therapy.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare hereditary disorder in which affected individuals are genetically predisposed to develop certain types of tumors and cysts in multiple organs. The most common manifestations are cerebellar, spinal and medullary hemangioblastomas, retinal angiomas, renal cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. A lifelong diagnosis that requires intense follow-up for multiple and recurrent tumors, this disease can greatly impact a family's sense of emotional and physical well-being. [References: 32]

N2  - There are many well-studied examples of human phenotypes resulting from nonsense or frameshift mutations that are modulated by Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD), a process that typically degrades transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) in order to prevent translation of unnecessary or aberrant transcripts. Different types of germline mutations in the VHL gene cause the von Hippel-Lindau disease, a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome with a marked phenotypic variability and age-dependent penetrance. By generating the Drosophila UAS:Upf1(D45B) line we showed the possible involvement of NMD mechanism in the modulation of the c.172delG frameshift mutation located in the exon 1 of Vhl gene. Further, by Quantitative Real-time PCR (QPCR) we demonstrated that the corresponding c.163delG human mutation is targeted by NMD in human HEK 293 cells. The UAS:Upf1(D45B) line represents a useful system to identify novel substrates of NMD pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Finally, we suggest the possible role of NMD on the regulation of VHL mutations. Copyright Â© 2009.

N2  - Objectives: Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most prevalent form of kidney cancer and is frequently associated with loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene function, resulting in the aberrant transcriptional activation of genes that contribute to tumor growth and metastasis, including transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. To determine the functional impact of EGFR activation on RCC, we suppressed critical components of this pathway: EGFR, Akt-1, and MEK-1. Methods: Stable transfection of RCC cells with plasmids bearing shRNA directed against each of these genes was used to individually suppress their expression. Transfectants were characterized for growth and invasiveness in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. Results: RCC cell transfectants displayed significantly reduced growth rate and matrix invasion in vitro and RCC tumor xenograft growth rate in vivo. Analysis of tumor cells that emerged after extended periods in each model showed that significant EGFR suppression was sustained, whereas Akt-1 and MEK-1 knock-down cells had escaped shRNA suppression. Conclusions: EGFR, Akt-1, and MEK-1 are individually critical for RCC cell invasiveness in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, and even partial suppression of each can have a significant impact on tumor progression. The emergence of transfectants that had escaped Akt-1 and MEK-1 suppression during tumorigenicity experiments suggests that these effectors may each be more critical than EGFR for RCC tumorigenesis, consistent with results from clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors for RCC, where durable clinical responses have not been seen.

N2  - Gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes and loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes (TSG) lead to cancer. In most human cancers, these mutations occur in somatic tissues. However, hereditary forms of cancer exist for which individuals are heterozygous for a germline mutation in a TSG locus at birth. The second allele is frequently inactivated by gene deletion, point mutation, or promoter methylation in classical TSGs that meet Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. Conversely, the second allele remains as wild-type, even in tumors in which the gene is haplo-insufficient for tumor suppression. This article highlights the importance of PTEN, APC, and other tumor suppressors for counteracting aberrant PI3K, beta-catenin, and other oncogenic signaling pathways. We discuss the use of gene-engineered mouse models (GEMM) of human cancer focusing on Pten and Apc knockout mice that recapitulate key genetic events involved in initiation and progression of human neoplasia. Finally, the therapeutic potential of targeting these tumor suppressor and oncogene signaling networks is discussed. Â© the author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.

N2  - The recent International Society Urological Pathology (ISUP) Vancouver classification of renal neoplasia distinguishes between clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) and multilocular cystic clear cell renal cell neoplasm of low malignant potential (mcCCRCNLMP). Current data supports the latter being a low aggressive neoplasm which does not recur or metastasize after definitive surgical treatment. Therefore, differentiating mcCCRCNLMP from low-grade CCRCC with cystic changes is important for patient management. The role of the pathologist is crucial in distinguishing between both entities. Since these tumors have overlapping molecular features, including 3p deletion and VHL mutations, it would be potentially clinically relevant to identify other molecular differences which might help to differentiate between these entities. We studied six different codons of KRAS and six codons of NRAS in mcCCRCNLMP and CCRCC of low grade and stage. All cases of CCRCC had a mutation in one of the studied KRAS codons. In contrast, no mutations were found in mcCCRCNLMP. We provide preliminary data to support that CCRCC and mcCCRCNLMP, in spite of their histologic similarity, show a different pattern of KRAS gene mutation, which is consistent with the observed differences in disease progression between these tumors.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a dominantly transmitted hereditary disorder associating multisystemic tumors affecting mainly the central nervous system, the kidneys, the pancreas, as well as pheochromocytomas. Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL on chromosome 3 are responsible for the disease. This article reports for the first time the study of two Lebanese VHL affected families, presenting particularly hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system. Two different mutations of the VHL gene, S65W and F76S, respectively identified in the two families, confirmed the clinical diagnosis of the patients. Molecular diagnosis was then performed for at risk members of these families. This article reveals the importance of molecular diagnosis for suspected patients and of presymptomatic diagnosis for at risk members, especially that a close follow-up of carriers allows an early detection of tumors and prevents the metastasis stage, the most common cause of death of these patients.

N2  - Inactivation of the HRPT2 gene encoding parafibromin was recently linked to the familial hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Patients with this syndrome carry an increased risk of parathyroid and renal tumors. To determine the relevance of HRPT2 for sporadic renal tumors, clear cell, papillary and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas as well as oncocytomas and Wilms tumors were analysed for HRPT2 gene alterations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of HRPT2 was found in seven of 56 (12.5%) clear cell, three of 14 (21%) papillary, six of 10 (60%) chromophobe renal cell carcinomas, three of eight (38%) oncocytomas and four of 10 (40%) Wilms tumors. In addition, two novel HRPT2 point mutations, causing K34Q and R292K changes in parafibromin, were detected in one clear cell carcinoma and one Wilms tumor, respectively. These tumors displayed LOH of the remaining wild-type allele, but interestingly no von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutation. Functional analysis revealed that the K34Q mutant species of parafibromin is, unlike wild-type protein, defective in suppressing cyclin D1 expression in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that renal cancer-associated mutations in parafibromin occur in the absence of VHL mutation, which in turn may contribute to constitutively elevated cyclin D1 expression and abnormal cell proliferation.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To define the surgical treatment and outcomes of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs), we analyzed consecutive VHL patients who underwent ELST resection. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective investigation of consecutive VHL patients who underwent resection of ELSTs at a clinical research center between 1999 and 2010. METHODS: Analysis of serial clinical examinations, audiograms, imaging studies, and operative findings were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one consecutive patients with ELSTs (15 males, 16 females) underwent resection of 33 tumors (mean follow-up, 49.9 +/- 48.0 months; range, 1.0-116 months). One patient had bilateral ELST resections and one patient underwent reoperation for recurrence. Mean age at surgery was 38.2 +/- 10.2 years (range, 12-67 years). Whereas 29 ears (88%) had direct radiographic evidence of an ELST, four ears (12%) did not. Mean tumor size was 1.3 +/- 1.1 cm (range, 0.2-5.2 cm). Whereas two patients (two ears, 6%) were asymptomatic, 29 patients (31 ears, 94% of ears) had associated audiovestibular symptoms, including sensorineural hearing loss (28 ears, 84%), tinnitus (24 ears,73%), and vertigo (21 patients, 68%). Postoperatively, hearing was stabilized (27) or improved (three) in 97% of 31 ears. Complete tumor resection was achieved in 30 ears (91% of 33 ears). Complications included cerebrospinal fluid leak in two ears (6%) and transient lower cranial nerve palsy in one ear (3%). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection of ELSTs can be performed with hearing preservation and a reduction in audiovestibular dysfunction. Early surgical resection can prevent or decrease disabling audiovestibular symptoms, enhance the opportunity for complete resection, and preserve hearing.

N2  - The VHL gene, isolated by positional cloning, encodes a protein of 284 aminoacids that has no homology with other proteins in the databases. The nucleotide sequence lacks domains that would suggest (a) a DNA binding protein, (b) nuclear localization, (c) enzymatic activity or (d) membrane localization. Studies are in progress on the size and cellular localization of the VHL protein and how it may function in growth regulation. How mutations in this small protein lead to a specific tumour spectrum presents an enormous research challenge. Germline mutations in the VHL gene are heterogeneous, and the resulting heterogeneity of mutations in the VHL protein that lead to disease suggests a protein whose function can be compromised by mutations over a large area. Study of the germline mutations and correlation with disease patterns provide the basis for a new clinical classification of von Hippel-Lindau disease. Somatic VHL mutations and hypermethylation of the VHL gene are found in some 75-80% of sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas. About 20% of clear cell renal carcinomas show neither VHL gene mutation or hypermethylation. Whether other chromosome 3 tumour suppressor genes have a pathogenetic role in clear cell renal carcinoma remains to be determined. Sorting out the contributions of different tumour suppressor genes to the pathogenesis of clear cell renal carcinomas will require assays demonstrating somatic mutation of candidate genes and functional assays to determine whether replacement of the mutant gene is associated with suppressed tumour growth.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell cancer (CC-RCC) is a highly chemoresistant tumor characterized by frequent inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. The prognosis is reportedly worse in patients whose tumors express immunoreactive type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R), a key mediator of tumor cell survival. We aimed to investigate how IGF1R expression is regulated, and found that IGF1R protein levels were unaffected by hypoxia, but were higher in CC-RCC cells harboring mutant inactive VHL than in isogenic cells expressing wild-type (WT) VHL. IGF1R mRNA and promoter activities were significantly lower in CC-RCC cells expressing WT VHL, consistent with a transcriptional effect. In Sp1-null Drosophila Schneider cells, IGF1R promoter activity was dependent on exogenous Sp1, and was suppressed by full-length VHL protein (pVHL) but only partially by truncated VHL lacking the Sp1-binding motif. pVHL also reduced the stability of IGF1R mRNA via sequestration of HuR protein. Finally, IGF1R mRNA levels were significantly higher in CC-RCC biopsies than benign kidney, confirming the clinical relevance of these findings. Thus, we have identified a new hypoxia-independent role for VHL in suppressing IGF1R transcription and mRNA stability. VHL inactivation leads to IGF1R upregulation, contributing to renal tumorigenesis and potentially also to chemoresistance.

N2  - Hemangioblastomas are histologically benign neoplasms that occur sporadically or as part of von Hippel-Lindau disease. Hemangioblastomas may occur anywhere along the neuraxis, but sacral hemangioblastomas are extremely rare. To identify features that will help guide the operative and clinical management of these lesions, the authors describe the management of a large von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated sacral hemangioblastoma and review the literature. The authors present the case of a 38-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau disease and a 10-year history of progressive back pain, as well as left lower-extremity pain and numbness. Neurological examination revealed decreased sensation in the left S-1 and S-2 dermatomes. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large enhancing lesion in the sacral region, with associated erosion of the sacrum. The patient underwent arteriography and embolization of the tumor and then resection. The histopathological diagnosis was consistent with hemangioblastoma and showed intrafascicular tumor infiltration of the S-2 nerve root. At 1-year follow-up examination, pain had resolved and numbness improved. Sacral nerve root hemangioblastomas may be safely removed in most patients, resulting in stabilization or improvement in symptomatology. Generally, hemangioblastomas of the sacral nerve roots should be removed when they cause symptoms. Because they originate from the nerve root, the nerve root from which the hemangioblastoma originates must be sacrificed to achieve complete resection. [References: 24]

N2  - The von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is commonly mutated in sporadic renal cell carcinoma, and while it plays a critical role in regulating the cellular response to hypoxia, little is known about the functional consequences of VHL mutations in the context of tissue susceptibility to chemical insult. VHL may be a target for environmental carcinogen trichloroethylene (TCE), which has been associated with a specific point mutation in the VHL gene. Mutations in VHL disrupt its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a) for degradation during normoxia. HIF-1a and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) are both conditionally regulated transcription factors that share a homology domain for dimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT). Consequently, we hypothesize that VHL mutation status may determine susceptibility to chemical insult by altering xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. To investigate this we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the VHL gene to generate a panel of mammalian expression constructs, which were transfected into the 786-O VHL null human renal cell carcinoma cell line. To induce AhR mediated gene transcription, the transfected cells were treated with 13uM benzo(a)pyrene for 18hrs in the presence and absence of hypoxia mimetic, cobalt chloride. We found that cell lacking VHL expression are unable induce CYP1A1 protein in response to BaP and fail to induce antioxidant responsive gene NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). VHL complementation restores CYP1A1 induction. This data suggests that VHL mutations may be disrupting AhR:ARNT transcriptional regulation of drug metabolizing genes and may modulate tissue susceptibility.

N1  - 10th International Luebeck Conference on the Pathophysiology and Pharmacology of Erythropoietin and other Hemopoietic Growth Factors. Germany
N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a highly vascularized and proliferative tumor and can be familiar or sporadic, often associated with genetic mutations - the most prominent being von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations. VHL protein is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). When a defective inactive VHL protein is produced, HIF is not degraded resulting in over-expression of hypoxia related genes including erythropoietin (EPO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), thus promoting angiogenesis, proliferation and tumorogenesis. Under normal oxygen tension, HIF transcription activation of hypoxia inducible genes is prevented through hydroxylation with prolyl hydroxylases (PHD). We analyzed tumor and surrounding healthy tissue from radical nephrectomy of 50 RCC patients. Direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the VHL gene in tumors and surrounding healthy tissues revealed somatic mutations in VHL gene 58% of all tumor samples. Sporadic disease was confirmed by analysis of DNA obtained from normal kidney tissue and blood leukocytes. We detected EPO expression in 23 of 50 tumor samples, mostly in clear renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and with VHL mutations in 65%. EPO receptor (EPOR) was detected in all examined samples, tumor and surrounding healthy tissues. The expression of VEGF was significantly higher in tumors, particularly in those with VHL mutations, but not its receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. HIF-1alpha expression was lower in tumors than in corresponding control tissues, but with no statistical significance. PHD1 protein was significantly reduced in tumors compared to control tissue, or undetectable, irrespective of the presence or absence of mutations in VHL, while PHD2 protein was increased in tumors with VHL gene mutations, suggesting inverse regulation of PHD1 and PHD2. MAPK pathway was induced in all tumors tissues, but there was no difference in JAK2-STAT5 and PI-3/AKT expression in comparison to control healthy tissue. Our data suggest alternation of two pathways in RCC tumors, increased MAPK activation and a change in hypoxia responsive pathways that are not necessarily associated with VHL gene mutations such as shift from PHD1 to PHD2 expression, increased expression of VEGF and EPO, and a reduction in HIF-1alpha.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant cancer syndrome. A phenomenon known as genetic anticipation has been documented in some hereditary cancer syndromes, where it was proved to relate to telomere shortening. Because studies of this phenomenon in VHL disease have been relatively scarce, we investigated anticipation in 18 Chinese VHL disease families. We recruited 34 parent-child patient pairs (57 patients) from 18 families with VHL disease. Onset age was defined as the age when any symptom or sign of VHL disease first appeared. Anticipation of onset age was analyzed by paired t test and the other two special tests (HV and RY2). Relative telomere length of peripheral leukocytes was measured in 29 patients and 325 healthy controls. Onset age was younger in child than in parent in 31 of the 34 parent-child pairs. Patients in the first generation had older onset age with longer age-adjusted relative telomere length, and those in the next generation had younger onset age with shorter age-adjusted relative telomere length (P < 0.001) in the 10 parent-child pairs from eight families with VHL disease. In addition, relative telomere length was shorter in the 29 patients with VHL disease than in the normal controls (P = 0.003). The anticipation may relate to the shortening of telomere length in patients with VHL in successive generations. These findings indicate that anticipation is present in families with VHL disease and may be helpful for genetic counseling for families with VHL disease families and for further understanding the pathogenesis of VHL disease.

N2  - EGLN1 and EGLN3 are members of the egg-laying-defective 9 (EglN) prolyl-hydroxylases which during normoxia catalyse hydroxylation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, thereby promoting its ubiquitination by a complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor. EGLN3 also has pro-apoptotic activity in some cell types. Analyses of a well-characterised series of cases of plasma cell dyscrasias, including multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia (WM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) surprisingly demonstrated that the CpG island of EGLN3, and not EGLN1, is frequently methylated in these disorders. Multiple myeloma patients with a methylated EGLN3 promoter showed trends towards an increased risk of death, bone lytic lesions, anaemia, advanced stage of disease and the presence of extramedullary disease. Those individuals with methylation in the EGLN3 CpG island also had significantly lower albumin levels. These data suggest that the prolyl-hydroxylases may be a novel class of potential tumour suppressors in plasma cell neoplasia that warrant further investigation with regard to their potential utility as biomarkers. Moreover, we observed that EGLN3 is also methylated at high frequency in B-cell lymphoma subtypes, implying that loss of EGLN3 is an important epigenetic event not only in plasma cell neoplasias but also in B-cell neoplasias.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for about 3% of all adult malignancies and its incidence is increasing. Smoking, obesity, and end-stage renal disease are important risk factors. Localized RCC may be cured with surgical excision. However, over one-third of patients eventually develop metastatic disease. While chemotherapy and radiation therapy are relatively ineffective for RCC, immunotherapy modestly extends survival and may lead to tumor regression and long-term survival in a small minority of patients. Recently, research into the pathology of genetic syndromes associated with RCC has led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of sporadic RCC. Rational therapeutic agents developed from this understanding have established new treatment paradigms for this disease. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Loss of function in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene occurs in familial and most sporadic renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). VHL has been linked to the regulation of cell cycle cessation (G(0)) and to control of expression of various mRNAs such as for vascular endothelial growth factor. RCC cells express the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, and Met mediates invasion and branching morphogenesis in many cell types in response to hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). We examined the HGF/SF responsiveness of RCC cells containing endogenous mutated (mut) forms of the VHL protein (VHL-negative RCC) with that of isogenic cells expressing exogenous wild-type (wt) VHL (VHL-positive RCC). We found that VHL-negative 786-0 and UOK-101 RCC cells were highly invasive through growth factor-reduced (GFR) Matrigel-coated filters and exhibited an extensive branching morphogenesis phenotype in response to HGF/SF in the three-dimensional (3D) GFR Matrigel cultures. In contrast, the phenotypes of A498 VHL-negative RCC cells were weaker, and isogenic RCC cells ectopically expressing wt VHL did not respond at all. We found that all VHL-negative RCC cells expressed reduced levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) relative to the wt VHL-positive cells, implicating VHL in the regulation of this molecule. However, consistent with the more invasive phenotype of the 786-0 and UOK-101 VHL-negative RCC cells, the levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were reduced and levels of the matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 were elevated compared to the noninvasive VHL-positive RCC cells. Moreover, recombinant TIMPs completely blocked HGF/SF-mediated branching morphogenesis, while neutralizing antibodies to the TIMPs stimulated HGF/SF-mediated invasion in vitro. Thus, the loss of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is central to changes that control tissue invasiveness, and a more invasive phenotype requires additional genetic changes seen in some but not all RCC lines. These studies also demonstrate a synergy between the loss of VHL function and Met signaling.

N2  - The peptide AM (adrenomedullin) is stimulated by hypoxia through HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1). The majority of human CC-RCCs (clear cell renal cell carcinomas) display mutations in the tumour suppressor protein von Hippel-Lindau, which leads to constitutively elevated HIF-1. We hypothesized that AM is increased in CC-RCC tumours and that AM is a plasma biomarker for CC-RCC. Tumours and non-malignant kidney tissue were obtained from patients that underwent unilateral nephrectomy. Blood samples were drawn at the day of surgery, 3-6 days after surgery and 4-5 weeks after surgery. AM mRNA and peptide expression in tissue and AM plasma concentration were determined. HIF-1alpha was localized in tissue by immunohistochemistry. AM mRNA was elevated in CC-RCC compared with adjacent renal cortex (6-fold, n=18; P<0.02). There was no difference in AM mRNA between cortex and non-CC-RCC tissue (n=7). AM peptide concentration was elevated in CC-RCC tissue compared with adjacent cortex (4-fold, n=6; P<0.02), whereas there was no difference between cortex and non-CC-RCC tissue (n=5). HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity was detected in the majority of cell nuclei in 76% of CC-RCC, consistent with constitutive stabilization. In non-CC-RCC, HIF-1alpha staining was focal. Before surgery there was no difference in plasma AM concentration between tumour types. Nephrectomy increased plasma AM significantly after 3-6 days and a similar pre-surgery level was observed after 4-5 weeks in both groups of tumour patients. We conclude that elevated tissue AM is a distinguishing feature of CC-RCC compared with other kidney tumours. Plasma AM is not suited as a tumour marker for this disease.

N2  - The Warburg effect describes how cancer cells down-regulate their aerobic respiration and preferentially use glycolysis to generate energy. To evaluate the link between hypoxia and Warburg effect, we studied mitochondrial electron transport, angiogenesis and glycolysis in pheochromocytomas induced by germ-line mutations in VHL, RET, NF1 and SDH genes. SDH and VHL gene mutations have been shown to lead to the activation of hypoxic response, even in normoxic conditions, a process now referred to as pseudohypoxia. We observed a decrease in electron transport protein expression and activity, associated with increased angiogenesis in SDH- and VHL-related, pseudohypoxic tumors, while stimulation of glycolysis was solely observed in VHL tumors. Moreover, microarray analyses revealed that expression of genes involved in these metabolic pathways is an efficient tool for classification of pheochromocytomas in accordance with the predisposition gene mutated. Our data suggest an unexpected association between pseudohypoxia and loss of p53, which leads to a distinct Warburg effect in VHL-related pheochromocytomas. Â© 2009 Favier et al.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a central regulator that controls the hypoxic response of mammalian cells through the induction of various target genes, and its expression contributes to the development and malignant progression of many tumors. We previously reported that some chemotherapeutic drugs and gamma-rays induce HIF-1alpha expression through increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. However, the mechanism by which intracellular ROS activate HIF-1alpha expression is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of ROS on HIF-1alpha signaling in OSCC cells by the transfection of manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD)-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). The levels of HIF-1alpha protein and mRNA were increased by siRNA under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in parallel with the increase in intracellular ROS levels. The accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein was enhanced through inhibition of the recruitment of von Hippel-Lindau protein and HIF-1alpha ubiquitination without a change in prolyl hydroxylase mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the transactivation of HIF-1alpha was enhanced via cap-dependent and internal ribosome entry site-mediated mechanisms. These results suggest that intracellular ROS produced by the knockdown of Mn-SOD enhance HIF-1alpha expression in OSCC cells through transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational regulation.

N2  - Purpose: RAF inhibitors are effective against melanomas with BRAF V600E mutations but may induce keratoacanthomas (KAs) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs). The potential of these agents to promote secondary malignancies is concerning. We analyzed cSCC and KA lesions for genetic mutations in an attempt to identify an underlying mechanism for their formation. Methods: Four international centers contributed 237 KA or cSCC tumor samples from patients receiving an RAF inhibitor (either vemurafenib or sorafenib; n = 19) or immunosuppression therapy (n = 53) or tumors that developed spontaneously (n = 165). Each sample was profiled for 396 known somatic mutations across 33 cancer-related genes by using a mass spectrometric-based genotyping platform. Results: Mutations were detected in 16% of tumors (38 of 237), with five tumors harboring two mutations. Mutations in TP53, CDKN2A, HRAS, KRAS, and PIK3CA were previously described in squamous cell tumors. Mutations in MYC, FGFR3, and VHL were identified for the first time. A higher frequency of activating RAS mutations was found in tumors from patients treated with an RAF inhibitor versus populations treated with a non-RAF inhibitor (21.1% v 3.2%; P < .01), although overall mutation rates between treatment groups were similar (RAF inhibitor, 21.1%; immunosuppression, 18.9%; and spontaneous, 17.6%; P = not significant). Tumor histology (KA v cSCC), tumor site (head and neck v other), patient age (<= 70 v > 70 years), and sex had no significant impact on mutation rate or type. Conclusion: Squamous cell tumors from patients treated with an RAF inhibitor have a distinct mutational profile that supports a mechanism of therapy-induced tumorigenesis in RAS-primed cells. Conceivably, cotargeting of MEK together with RAF may reduce or prevent formation of these tumors. Â© 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  - Phaeochromocytomas are neoplasias of neural crest origin arising from the adrenal medulla. Extra-adrenal phaeochromocytomas occur and may be referred to as paragangliomas, although this term is also used to describe vascular head and neck tumours, which most commonly develop at the carotid bifurcation. Historically, genetic factors have been implicated in up to 10% of phaeochromocytoma cases, but recent data suggest that germline mutations may be detected in approximately 25% of unselected cases. The most frequent causes of phaeochromocytoma susceptibility are von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), the newly delineated phaeochromocytoma-paraganglioma syndrome and, less commonly, neurofibromatosis type 1. Germline mutations in three of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, mitochondrial complex II) subunits (SDHD, SDHB and SDHC) cause susceptibility to head and neck paragangliomas, and may be found in approximately 20% of unselected patients. In addition, germline SDHD and SDHB mutations may cause phaeochromocytoma susceptibility with or without associated head and neck paragangliomas. Recent studies suggest that germline SDHD and SDHB mutations are an important cause of familial and isolated phaeochromocytoma. The mechanism by which SDH subunit mutations predispose to phaeochromocytomas has not been defined in detail, but dysregulation of hypoxia-responsive genes and impairment of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis have both been suggested.

N2  - A 67-year-old patient with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is described. At fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the peripheral blood, the lymphocytes were positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, CD29, CD45RA, CD57, and TCR alpha/beta and negative for CD7, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD19, CD22, and TCR gamma/delta. Bone marrow histology and immunohistochemistry did not reveal any lymphocyte infiltration. Cytogenetic examination of peripheral blood cultures showed a clone with the karyotype 46,XY,t(3;5)(p26;q13). Molecular analysis revealed rearrangement of the gamma-T-cell-receptor chain. The region 3p25-3p26 which harbors the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene and the RAF1 oncogene has been rearranged in a few cases of T-cell leukemia. The translocation in this case has not yet been described and may reflect an alternative mechanism in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: RNF139/TRC8 is a potential tumor suppressor gene with similarity to PTCH, a tumor suppressor implicated in basal cell carcinomas and glioblastomas. TRC8 has the potential to act in a novel regulatory relationship linking the cholesterol/lipid biosynthetic pathway with cellular growth control and has been identified in families with hereditary renal (RCC) and thyroid cancers. Haploinsufficiency of TRC8 may facilitate development of clear cell-RCC in association with VHL mutations, and may increase risk for other tumor types. We report a paternally inherited balanced translocation t(8;22) in a proposita with dysgerminoma. METHODS: The translocation was characterized by FISH and the breakpoints cloned, sequenced, and compared. DNA isolated from normal and tumor cells was checked for abnormalities by array-CGH. Expression of genes TRC8 and TSN was tested both on dysgerminoma and in the proposita and her father. RESULTS: The breakpoints of the translocation are located within the LCR-B low copy repeat on chromosome 22q11.21, containing the palindromic AT-rich repeat (PATRR) involved in recurrent and non-recurrent translocations, and in an AT-rich sequence inside intron 1 of the TRC8 tumor-suppressor gene at 8q24.13. TRC8 was strongly underexpressed in the dysgerminoma. Translin is underexpressed in the dysgerminoma compared to normal ovary.TRC8 is a target of Translin (TSN), a posttranscriptional regulator of genes transcribed by the transcription factor CREM-tau in postmeiotic male germ cells. CONCLUSION: A role for TRC8 in dysgerminoma may relate to its interaction with Translin. We propose a model in which one copy of TRC8 is disrupted by a palindrome-mediated translocation followed by complete loss of expression through suppression, possibly mediated by miRNA.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone; it maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and modulates unfolded protein response. The protein is overexpressed in various cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Increased Grp78 expression in patients with RCC is correlated with more aggressive tumors and poorer prognoses. This study investigated the role of Grp78 in regulating tumorigenesis and evaluated the potential of Grp78-targeted therapy for RCC. METHODS: The expression level of Grp78 was examined in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-intact or VHL-null RCC cell lines by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Specific Grp78 ribonucleic acid interference was applied as a molecularly Grp78-targeted therapeutic approach. This method enabled us to assess the effects of manipulating Grp78 expression to regulate RCC cell growth. RESULTS: The Grp78 messenger ribonucleic acid and protein were expressed in both VHL-intact and VHL-null RCC cell lines. The specific inhibition of Grp78 expression suppressed RCC cell growth and colony formation significantly, and induced G1 cell-cycle arrest. We also showed that inhibiting Grp78 expression increased the cells' resistance to the cytotoxicity of the S-phase-specific anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil. This effect was regulated by the unfolded protein response-induced suppression of G1/S transition-related cyclins (D1, E1, and E2) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4 and CDK6) protein expression. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings indicate the regulatory function of Grp78 in RCC cell proliferation, and provide a molecular-based mechanism of Grp78 positivity in the progression of RCC.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, predisposing to the development of various tumors (central nervous system and retinal hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinoma and/or renal cysts, pheochromocytomas, pancreatic cysts and/or tumors). Incidence of the disease is 1/36 000. Central nervous system hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma are the main causes of death. The VHL gene, located on chromosome 3p25-26, is a tumor-supressor gene encoding for a 213 amino acid protein which plays a major role in regulation of VEGF expression. Germline mutations of the VHL gene are identified in about 75-80 % of the patients. Somatic mutations of the VHL gene are found in both sporadic central nervous system hemangioblastomas and sporadic 'clear' renal cell carcinomas. For neurosurgeons search for VHL disease should be imperative in presence of a patient with apparently << sporadic >> central nervous system or endolymphatic sac tumor.

N2  - Context: The recent identification of germline mutations of the mitochondrial complex II genes in variants of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma syndrome has enlarged the number of known causative genes for hereditary pheochromocytoma. A question confronting clinicians is whether they should screen patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas for unsuspected germline mutations of some or all of the seven genes known to cause hereditary paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma (NF1, VHL, RET, MEN1, SDHD, SDHC, and SDHB). A positive answer was suggested by a report that placed the estimate of hereditary disease in apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma as high as 24%. Evidence Acquisition: We applied clinically useful criteria to a review of the literature, defining cases of apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma as those without a suspicious personal or family history, with a focal, unilateral pheochromocytoma, and presenting at age less than 50 yr. Evidence Synthesis: We reduced the overall estimate of unsuspected hereditary pheochromocytoma patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma to approximately 17%. Mutations in only three genes (VHL, SDHB, and SDHD) accounted for almost this entire minority, and unsuspected RET mutation was rare. Costs, coverage by insurance, the potential effect on insurability, and deficient information for populations outside of referral centers should be considered before recommending genetic testing in patients with apparently sporadic presentations of pheochromocytomas. Conclusion: We recommend genetic testing for patients with an apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma under the age of 20 yr with family history or features suggestive of hereditary pheochromocytoma or for patients with sympathetic paragangliomas. For individuals who do not meet these criteria, genetic testing is optional. Copyright Â© 2006 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in the VHL gene result in the constitutive stabilization of transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha and 2alpha, which bind to specific enhancer elements in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and stimulate angiogenesis. This increase in angiogenesis under normoxic conditions in key target organs such as the brain, kidney, and eye leads to high morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Drugs designed to block the VEGF signaling pathway may prevent the long-term complications of the disease. To test this hypothesis, a clinical study was initiated to evaluate the effect of the VEGF tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor SU5416 in patients with VHL syndrome. Preliminary data on SU5416 indicate that it is well tolerated when administered chronically in such patients. However, since little is known about the long-term use of such inhibitors, patients will need careful monitoring. Data obtained from monitoring these patients will provide valuable information for adjuvant treatment trials in cancer patients. [References: 45]

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) negatively regulates hypoxia-inducible mRNAs such as the mRNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This activity has been linked to its ability to form multimeric complexes that contain elongin C, elongin B, and Cul2. To understand this process in greater detail, we performed a series of in vitro binding assays using pVHL, elongin B, and elongin C variants as well as synthetic peptide competitors derived from pVHL or elongin C. A subdomain of elongin C (residues 17-50) was necessary and sufficient for detectable binding to elongin B. In contrast, elongin B residues required for binding to elongin C were not confined to a discrete colinear domain. We found that the pVHL (residues 157-171) is necessary and sufficient for binding to elongin C in vitro and is frequently mutated in families with VHL disease. These mutations preferentially involve residues that directly bind to elongin C and/or alter the conformation of pVHL such that binding to elongin C is at least partially diminished. These results are consistent with the view that diminished binding of pVHL to the elongins plays a causal role in VHL disease.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a major heritable renal cell cancer (RCC) syndrome. 24-45% of VHL patients have a cumulative risk to develop RCC. The management of VHL has changed significantly as clinicians have learned how to best balance the risk of cancer dissemination while minimizing renal morbidity. Despite the improving management of this disease, there are no evidence-based guidelines of the treatment of localized and advanced RCC in VHL. Here, we describe a 39-year-old patient with VHL disease who developed metastatic RCC and received sunitinib with complete remission.

N2  - OBJECT: Central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas are benign vascular tumors arising either sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a hereditary cancer syndrome. The authors studied a series of patients with CNS hemangioblastomas and their families to identify germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene and to establish a predictive testing and screening protocol. METHODS: Patients admitted between 2002 and 2004 to the Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia for hemangioblastoma were prospectively enrolled, together with their at-risk family members. The authors performed the molecular analysis of the VHL gene by using polymerase chain reaction and direct genetic sequencing. All asymptomatic mutation carriers underwent genetic counseling and tumor surveillance. Ninety-eight individuals were tested for VHL mutations--23 symptomatic and 75 asymptomatic individuals belonging to 16 families. Seven of the families had definite clinical criteria of VHL disease, five had sporadic hemangioblastoma, and four had CNS hemangioblastoma combined with minor visceral signs. Molecular genetic testing identified five germline mutations in six of the definite VHL families (sensitivity 85%), but none in the possible VHL and sporadic hemangioblastoma cases; four of these mutations had been previously described and one is a novel mutation present in two unrelated families. After patients carrying the mutation were identified, they underwent clinical screening and asymptomatic VHL-related lesions were identified in 43%. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing for mutations in the VHL gene is crucial in patients with CNS hemangioblastoma. The prompt identification of patients carrying the genetic mutation allows for a multidisciplinary screening protocol to decrease morbidity and mortality rates in these patients, while avoiding costly and invasive procedures for noncarriers.

N2  - Hemangioblastomas consist of 10-20% neoplastic "stromal" cells within a vascular tumor cell mass of reactive pericytes, endothelium and lymphocytes. Familial cases of central nervous system hemangioblastoma uniformly result from mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. In contrast, inactivation of VHL has been previously observed in only a minority of sporadic hemangioblastomas, suggesting an alternative genetic etiology. We performed deep-coverage DNA sequencing on 32 sporadic hemangioblastomas (whole exome discovery cohort n = 10, validation n = 22), followed by analysis of clonality, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation. We identified somatic mutation, loss of heterozygosity and/or deletion of VHL in 8 of 10 discovery cohort tumors. VHL inactivating events were ultimately detected in 78% (25/32) of cases. No other gene was significantly mutated. Overall, deep-coverage sequence analysis techniques uncovered VHL alterations within the neoplastic fraction of these tumors at higher frequencies than previously reported. Our findings support the central role of VHL inactivation in the molecular pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic hemangioblastomas.

N2  - PURPOSE: We defined the prognostic role of tumor necrosis and its extent in nonmetastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Also, we further investigated its pathogenesis by correlating this tumor feature with other pathological characteristics and molecular markers related to the von Hippel Lindau-hypoxia inducible factor pathway and to tumor proliferation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 213 patients with nonmetastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma were evaluated. Mean followup was 66 months. The presence and extent of histological necrosis were correlated with clinicopathological factors, Ki-67 antigen expression calculated by the MIB-1 (Ki-67 antibody) index, pVHL, HIF-1alpha, the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte subset and cancer specific survival. RESULTS: Histological necrosis was present in 63.8% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cases. Necrosis was significantly associated with grade and the degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, while its extent correlated significantly with grade, the degree of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and stage. Tumor necrosis was a significant prognostic factor, which was confirmed even when limiting analysis to patients with intracapsular renal cell carcinoma. On multivariate analysis histological necrosis was not an independent predictor of cancer specific survival. The extent of tumor necrosis was not a significant prognostic factor. The presence and extent of histological necrosis was not associated with high Ki-67 expression and it did not correlate with pVHL expression or with nuclear and cytoplasmic HIF-1alpha expression. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results we cannot support histological necrosis and its extent as prognostic factors for clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Efforts should be made to develop nomograms that use routinely available and objective predictor variables. The precise mechanism that causes tumor necrosis remains unknown but the host immune response might significantly contribute to its development.

N2  - Genome- and exome-sequencing costs are continuing to fall, and many individuals are undergoing these assessments as research participants and patients. The issue of secondary (so-called incidental) findings in exome analysis is controversial, and data are needed on methods of detection and their frequency. We piloted secondary variant detection by analyzing exomes for mutations in cancer-susceptibility syndromes in subjects ascertained for atherosclerosis phenotypes. We performed exome sequencing on 572 ClinSeq participants, and in 37 genes, we interpreted variants that cause high-penetrance cancer syndromes by using an algorithm that filtered results on the basis of mutation type, quality, and frequency and that filtered mutation-database entries on the basis of defined categories of causation. We identified 454 sequence variants that differed from the human reference. Exclusions were made on the basis of sequence quality (26 variants) and high frequency in the cohort (77 variants) or dbSNP (17 variants), leaving 334 variants of potential clinical importance. These were further filtered on the basis of curation of literature reports. Seven participants, four of whom were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and three of whom did not meet family-history-based referral criteria, had deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. One participant had a deleterious SDHC mutation, which causes paragangliomas. Exome sequencing, coupled with multidisciplinary interpretation, detected clinically important mutations in cancer-susceptibility genes; four of such mutations were in individuals without a significant family history of disease. We conclude that secondary variants of high clinical importance will be detected at an appreciable frequency in exomes, and we suggest that priority be given to the development of more efficient modes of interpretation with trials in larger patient groups.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma (PCC) and abdominal paraganglioma (PGL) are neuroendocrine tumors that present with clinical symptoms related to increased catecholamine levels. About a third of the cases are associated with constitutional mutations in pre-disposing genes, of which some may also be somatically mutated in sporadic cases. However, little is known about inactivating epigenetic events through promoter methylation in these very genes. Using bisulphite pyrosequencing we assessed the methylation density of 11 PCC/PGL disease genes in 96 tumors (83 PCCs and 13 PGLs) and 34 normal adrenal references. Gene expression levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Both tumors and normal adrenal samples exhibited low methylation index (MetI) in the EGLN1 (PDH2), MAX, MEN1, NF1, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2 (SDH5), and TMEM127 promoters, not exceeding 10% in any of the samples investigated. Aberrant RET promoter methylation was observed in two cases only. For the VHL gene we found increased MetI in tumors as compared with normal adrenals (57% vs. 27%; P<0.001), in malignant vs. benign tumors (63% vs. 55%; P<0.05), and in PGL vs. PCC (66% vs. 55%; P<0.0005). Decreased expression of the VHL gene was observed in all tumors compared with normal adrenals (P<0.001). VHL MetI and gene expressions were inversely correlated (R = -0.359, P<0.0001). Our results show that the VHL gene promoter has increased methylation compared with normal adrenals (MetI>50%) in approximately 75% of PCCs and PGLs investigated, highlighting the role of VHL in the development of these tumors.

N2  - Germline inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is associated with an increased risk of clear cell carcinoma of the kidney in the context of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Somatic VHL mutations are also common in nonhereditary (sporadic) clear cell carcinomas. The VHL protein (pVHL) has multiple functions that might be linked to tumor suppression, including targeting the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. HIF, especially HIF2alpha, appears to play a causal role in clear cell renal carcinogenesis based on genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease, laboratory experiments with human VHL-/- renal carcinoma cell lines, and genetically engineered mouse models. Deregulation of HIF almost certainly accounts for the high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) observed in kidney cancer and relates to their sensitivity to VEGF inhibitors. In addition, the beneficial effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are likely due to, at least partly, their ability to down-regulate HIF. pVHL, in a HIF-independent manner, also regulates a specialized structure called the primary cilium and regulates apoptosis via factors such as NFkappaB. Loss of the primary cilium probably facilitates the development of preneoplastic renal cysts, whereas increased NFkappaB might contribute to the resistance of kidney cancers to conventional cytotoxic agents.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with renal cell carcinomas (RCC) have few treatment options, underscoring the importance of developing new approaches such as immunotherapy. However, few tumor associated antigens (TAA), which can be targeted by immunotherapy, have been identified for this type of cancer. von Hippel-Lindau clear cell RCC (VHL(-/-)RCC) are characterized by mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Loss of VHL function causes the overexpression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, leading us to hypothesize that TGF-alpha could be a potential TAA for immunotherapy of kidney cancer, which was evaluated in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We first confirmed the absent or weak expression of TGF-alpha in important normal tissues as well as its overexpression in 61% of renal tumors in comparison to autologous normal kidney tissues. In addition, we demonstrated the immunogenicity of TGF-alpha, by expanding many T cell lines specific for certain TGF-alpha peptides or the mature TGF-alpha protein, when presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Interestingly, some of these TGF-alpha-specific T cells were polyfunctionals and secreted IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2. CONCLUSION: We have shown that TGF-alpha is a valid candidate TAA, which should allow the development of a targeted immunotherapy.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma remains a challenge to clinical medicine, with curative therapy experienced by a minority of patients. Mounting evidence suggests that the biological response modifiers, which consistently produce durable responses in some patients, may not need to be given in the high doses that have been associated with considerable, even fatal, toxicity; low-dose regimens in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents are yielding comparable, and possibly superior, results. Molecular biologic techniques have now advanced to the point where better classification schemes and prognostic variables are being elucidated, which may allow better optimization of specific treatment programs by allowing better patient discrimination. Further, with a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of renal carcinogenesis, new agents and approaches to the problem of advanced renal cell carcinoma can be developed. [References: 53]

N2  - Objective: To explore a technology for diagnosing VHL mutations from a single cell and provide experimental evidences for the feasibility of applying technology in detecting genetic mutations from a single cell. Methods: After whole-genome amplification (WGA) based on multiple displacement amplication (MDA) for a single cell, we did regular PCR following sequencing and detected the genotypes using the real time PCR based on TaqMan probes. We detected VHL mutations by the different terminal fluorescent changing. Results: The rate of amplification for single cell based on MDA was 90.91%. The rate of contamination was 0. After sequencing, the allele drop out (ADO) rate of heterozygotes was 26.67% (8/30); combined with the different terminal fluorescent changing, the rate of ADO of heterozygotes was 16.67%. Conclusion: WGA based on MDA for a single cell followed by regular PCR with sequencing and real time PCR can specially and accurately detect the VHL genotypes of single cells.

N2  - Inheritance of a mutant allele of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene predisposes affected individuals to develop renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Von Hippel-Lindau gene inactivation in single renal tubular cells has indirectly been showed by immunohistochemical staining for the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha target gene product carbonic anhydrase IX. In this study we were able to show von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion in carbonic anhydrase IX positive nonneoplastic renal tubular cells, in epithelial cells lining renal cysts and in a clear cell renal cell carcinoma of a von Hippel-Lindau patient. This was carried out by means of laser confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization. Carbonic anhydrase IX negative normal renal tubular cells carried no von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that the von Hippel-Lindau gene product is necessary for the maintenance of primary cilia stability in renal epithelial cells and that disruption of the cilia structure by von Hippel-Lindau gene inactivation induces renal cyst formation. In our study, we show a significant shortening of primary cilia in epithelial cells lining renal cysts, whereas, single tubular cells with a von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion display to a far lesser extent signs of cilia shortening. Our in vivo results support a model in which renal cysts represent precursor lesions for clear cell renal cell carcinoma and arise from single renal tubular epithelial cells owing to von Hippel-Lindau gene deletion.

N2  - The VHL tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets HIF for destruction. pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells exhibit increased NF-kappaB activity but the mechanism is unclear. NF-kappaB affects tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance in some settings. We found that pVHL associates with the NF-kappaB agonist Card9 but does not target Card9 for destruction. Instead, pVHL serves as an adaptor that promotes the phosphorylation of the Card9 C terminus by CK2. Elimination of these sites markedly enhanced Card9's ability to activate NF-kappaB in VHL<sup>+/+</sup> cells, and Card9 siRNA normalized NF-kappaB activity in VHL<sup>-/-</sup> cells and restored their sensitivity to cytokine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, downregulation of Card9 in VHL<sup>-/-</sup> cancer cells reduced their tumorigenic potential. Therefore pVHL can serve as an adaptor for both a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and a kinase. The latter activity, which promotes Card9 phosphorylation, links pVHL to control of NF-kappaB activity and tumorigenesis. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is a hereditary multisystem cancer syndrome requiring lifelong prophylactic surveillance. Current surveillance recommendations rely on best medical judgement and no evidence of effect exists. We aimed to evaluate the capability of surveillance in manifestation detection, before these turn symptomatic, in order to prevent disabling or even fatal outcomes. We focus on surveillance of central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, retinal hemangiomas and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as these have the most severe consequences. On the basis of full medical records from 54 living . vHL-mutation carriers, risks of intercurrent manifestations in-between surveillance examinations were determined and clinical consequences of surveillance findings evaluated. Current recommendations of annual ophthalmic and abdominal examinations corresponded to acceptably low intercurrent manifestation risks (1.7% and 1.2%, respectively), whereas recommendations of biennial CNS imaging corresponded to a risk of 7.2%. Annual CNS examinations, however, significantly reduces this risk to 2.7%. Furthermore, most CNS manifestations found due to surveillance (71%, 106 of 150) had clinical consequence for the patient. Also, pre-symptomatic surveillance increased cumulative incidence of clinical vHL diagnosis from 46% to 72% and from 89% to 94% by age 30 and 50 years, respectively. The present results promote optimization of surveillance, expectantly improving clinical vHL outcomes. Â© 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - Five years after the identification of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, physicians, scientists and concerned VHL family members met to review the current state of knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of VHL and to summarize the latest information on the biochemistry of the VHL protein (pVHL). The NIH and University of Pennsylvania groups reported the detection of germ-line mutations in 100% (93 of 93) of VHL families studied. Several studies determined the frequency of VHL germ-line mutations in individuals with a single manifestation of VHL without a family history of VHL. National groups to improve the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with VHL disease have been established in Great Britain, Denmark, France, Holland, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United States. Evidence for the existence of genes that modify the expression of VHL was presented. The VHL protein appears to have several distinct functions: (a) down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs; (b) proper assembly of the extracellular fibronectin matrix; (c) regulation of exit from the cell cycle; and (d) regulation of expression of carbonic anhydrases 9 and 12.

N2  - The induction of protein degradation by chimeric small molecules represented by proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) is an emerging approach for novel drug development. We have developed a series of chimeric molecules termed specific and non-genetic inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP)-dependent protein erasers (SNIPERs) that recruit IAP ubiquitin ligases to effect targeted degradation. Unlike the chimeric molecules that recruit von Hippel-Lindau and cereblon ubiquitin ligases, SNIPERs induce simultaneous degradation of IAPs such as cIAP1 and XIAP along with the target proteins. Because cancer cells often overexpress IAPs-a mechanism involved in the resistance to cancer therapy-SNIPERs could be used to kill cancer cells efficiently. Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.

N2  - Context: Hereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PC/PGL) accounts for up to 60% of previously considered sporadic tumors. Guidelines suggest that phenotype should guide genetic testing. Next-generation sequencing technology can simultaneously sequence 9 of the 18 known susceptibility genes in a timely, cost-efficient manner. Objective: Our aim was to confirm that universal screening is superior to targeted testing in patients with histologically confirmed PC and PGL. Methods: In two tertiary referral hospitals in Ireland, NGS was carried out on all histologically confirmed cases of PC/PGL diagnosed between 2004 and 2013. The following susceptibility genes were sequenced: VHL, RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, TMEM127, and MAX. A multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis was performed in VHL, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, and SDHAF2 genes to detect deletions and duplications. Results: A total of 31 patients were tested, 31% (n = 10) of whom were found to have a genetic mutation. Of those patients with a positive genotype, phenotype predicted genotype in only 50% (n = 5). Significant genetic mutations that would have been missed in our cohort by phenotypic evaluation alone include a mutation in TMEM127, two mutations in SDHAF2, and two mutations in RET. Target testing would have identified three of the latter mutations based on age criteria. However, 20% of patients (n = 2) would not have satisfied any criteria for targeted testing including one patient with a novel presentation of an SDHAF2 mutation. Conclusion: This study supports the value of universal genetic screening for all patients with PC/PGL. Copyright Â© 2014 by the Endocrine Society.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a hereditary tumor susceptibility syndrome, characterized by an increased risk of developing multiple benign and malignant tumors at various sites and ages with limited preventive options. This study evaluates the prevalence of distress among VHL family members and factors associated significantly with such distress.Forty-eight families with a VHL mutation were identified via the nine family cancer clinics in the Netherlands. In total, 171 family members (carriers, 50% at-risk, non-carriers) were approached, of whom 123 (72%) completed a self-report questionnaire. Approximately 40% of the VHL family members reported clinically relevant levels of distress, approaching 50% among the carriers and, possibly even more striking, 36% among the non-carriers. Having lost a first degree relative due to VHL during adolescence (OR 11.2; 95% CI 1.4-86.9) was related significantly to heightened levels of distress. Approximately, only one-third of those who reported heightened levels of distress had received professional psychosocial support. A substantial percentage of family members experience clinically relevant levels of distress. We would recommend the introduction of a procedure for screening for distress in this vulnerable population. Special attention should be paid to those individuals who have lost a close relative due to VHL during adolescence. Â© 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is expressed in neurons of the central nervous system and plays an important role during the neuronal differentiation of central nervous system progenitor cells. To elucidate the neuronal differentiating potential of VHL protein in neuroblastoma cells, we overexpressed or inhibited VHL protein in human neuroblastoma cells (SY-SH5Y), and examined the morphological change, expressions of neuronal markers, and electrophysiological functions. Here we show that with VHL gene transduction SY-SH5Y cells stably expressing the VHL protein had neurite-like processes with varicosities, showed the distinct expression of the neuronal markers neuropeptide Y and neurofilament 200, acquired regulated neurosecretion competence in response to depolarizing and cholinergic stimuli, and had large voltage-gated fast sodium currents and delayed rectifier potassium (Kv) currents compatible with those of functional neurons. In addition, they displayed inactivated ether-a-go-go potassium channels related to the promotion of the cell cycle and to the termination of differentiation. Also, by treatment with retinoic acid, they rapidly underwent cell death related to apoptosis. These findings suggest that the induction of neuronal function by VHL protein is associated with down-regulation of the cell cycle. In contrast, the inhibition of endogenous expression of VHL protein with antisense-orientated VHL gene transduction reduced such neuronal properties inherent to these cells, including the capacity for activation of ether-a-go-go channels. In conclusion, VHL protein has a neuronal differentiating potential to transform neuroblastoma cells into functional neuron-like cells. Our finding of the neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells under the control of the VHL gene may contribute to the development of clinical techniques for neuronal regeneration in the case of intractable neuronal diseases and for differentiation therapy against neuroblastomas.

N2  - The oncogene HDM2 has been implicated in the regulation of the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). We show in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective renal carcinoma cells that express constitutively high levels of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha that down-regulation of HDM2 by siRNA leads to decreased levels of both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels. However, we show a differential regulation of HDM2 on the HIF angiogenic targets, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and endothelin-1 (ET-1): siRNA to HDM2 leads to increased expression of VEGF and PAI-1 proteins but decreased levels of ET-1. We show that HDM2-mediated regulation of these proteins is independent of VHL and p53 but dependent on a novel action of HDM2. Ablation of HDM2 leads to phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in renal carcinoma cells. We show that regulation of these angiogenic factors is dependent on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which can be reversed by addition of the MAP/ERK1/2 kinase inhibitors PD98059 and PD184352. This study identifies a novel role for the HDM2 oncoprotein in the regulation of angiogenic factors in renal cell carcinoma. Â©2008 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is an inherited syndrome caused by mutations of the VHL gene. It predisposes to the development of retinal and CNS hemangiomas, renal or pancreatic cysts/tumors, endolymphatic sac tumors and pheochromocytomas (pheo).We evaluated both the clinical presentation and the outcome of a total of 49 patients,including 19 index cases (aged 4-21y),with VHL confirmed by molecular studies and their affected relatives detected by genetic screening (n=30).To caracterize VHL gene mutations,a PCR-based SSCP strategy followed by direct sequencing was performed.All patients presented missense/nonssense mutations in the VHL gene.Patients were divided into 2 groups according to age: group 1,under 21y (n=31, 20males,11females) and group 2,aged 24-75y (n=18,11males,7 females).The initial manifestation of VHL in group 1 was pheo in 25/31 patients (81%).During follow-up 20/25 pheo patients remained free of disease (median 6.5y, range:2-34y)while the other 5 patients presented hemangioblastoma of CNS(4), retina(2) and/or pancreatic tumor(1), with a disease-free interval of 4-23y (median19y).Retinal hemangioblastoma (1),endolimphatic sac tumor(1) and CNS hemangioblastoma(4) were the initial presentation in the remaining 6 patients in this group.In 3/6 the tumor relapsed or another organ was involved within1-2 years.In one case, pheo appeared after 16y of disease onset. Only one patient died. In group 2 the most common initial manifestation was CNS hemangioblastoma, observed in 8/18 patients(45%),followed by pheo in 6/18 patients(33%).The other clinical initial events were:retinal hemangioma in 2/18,clear cell renal carcinoma in1/18 and neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas in 1/18.Nine patients remained free of disease (follow up:1-30y, median: 5y).Four patients died due to VHL, one of them post surgery and the others at 2, 5 and11y of follow up.The mutations found in the index cases were:Arg167Thr(4), Arg161Term(3),Pro193Leu(2), Arg161Gln(1),Arg167Gln(1),Arg9His(1),Gly144Term(1),Leu163Arg(1),Pro138Arg(1),Pro86Ser(1), Thr124Ile(1), Val 84Leu(1), Arg200Pro(1).All detected mutations were associated with pheo, except Arg161Term. Our results confirmed that pheo is the predominant inicial event in VHL in the pediatric group. They also show that these patients present a much better outcome than those with other tumors at disease onset. Since comorbid pathology can appear after a long disease-free period, lifelong surveillance is mandatory in both groups.

N2  - We present an adult man who, while being evaluated for gross hematuria, was found to have polycystic kidneys and multiple bilateral renal cell carcinomas. Further evaluation and the presence of a significant family history of cancer suggested the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease. Through the aid of genetic testing, this unusual diagnosis was confirmed and led to the identification of other family members with the von Hippel-Lindau gene. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have an increased incidence of malignant carcinomas and the syndrome can mimic the presentation of other cystic diseases of the kidney. Early diagnosis and genetic screening of family members is essential to improve the prognosis and survival of those affected.

N2  - In this study, we attempted to elucidate the E3 ubiquitin ligase for topo IIalpha. When cullins and VHL were ectopically expressed in HT1080 and HEK293T cells, topo IIalpha was degraded most prominently in cullin 2- and VHL-expressing cells. Cullin 2 and the beta domain (aa 114-123) of VHL, a subunit of the ECV (Elongin B/C-cullin 2-VHL protein) complex, specifically interact with the ATPase domain of topo IIalpha. We identified that topo IIalpha associated with endogenous Elongin C. In HT1080 cells co-transfected with deletion mutants of topo IIalpha GRDD (glucose-regulated destruction domain) and VHL, topo IIalpha was degraded by VHL expression. These results demonstrate that ECV acts as E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting GRDD-independent topo IIalpha to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by the development of multiple vascular tumours. The syndrome is caused by inactivation of the VHL protein (pVHL) and increased production of VEGF, PDGF, and TGF-alpha. The course of VHL syndrome is associated with the development of multiple vascular tumours. Most frequently, these include retinal and central nervous system haemangioblastomas, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, phaeochromocytomas, pancreatic islet tumours, endolymphatic sac tumours, and additionally, renal and pancreatic cystadenomas and epididymal cystadenomas in men. VHL syndrome is a highly complex disease; hence, the diagnosis is often difficult. The diagnosis of any of the characteristic tumours, particularly in children, is an implicit indication for the necessity of diagnosis and genetic tests in the patient and family members and for intensive supervision of carriers of the mutated gene, thereby improving early diagnosis and successful treatment of the malignancies.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene. VHL disease is characterised by marked phenotypic variability and the most common tumours are haemangioblastomas of the retina and central nervous system and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However, endocrine tumours, most commonly phaeochromocytoma and non-secretory pancreatic islet cell cancers, demonstrate marked interfamilial variations in frequency and are significant causes of morbidity and, sometimes, mortality. Genotype-phenotype correlations have revealed that certain missense mutations are associated with a high risk of phaeochromocytoma but total loss of function mutations are associated with a low risk. Furthermore, rare mutations may predispose to a phaeochromocytoma-only phenotype. Germline VHL mutations may be detected in 5-11% of all phaeochromocytoma cases and mutation analysis of VHL and other phaeochromocytoma susceptibility genes (SDHB, SDHD and RET) should be performed in all cases of familial, multiple or early onset phaeochromocytomas, and considered in other cases. The VHL gene product has a key role in regulating the stability of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2) such that inactivation of VHL leads to up-regulation of HIF-1 and HIF-2 protein expression and activation of hypoxic gene response pathways. Germline SDHB and SDHD mutations also lead to increased expression of HIF target genes, but it appears that phaeochromocytoma susceptibility in VHL disease cannot be attributed to HIF activation alone. Recently, it has been suggested that an HIF-independent failure of developmental apoptosis is a common feature of all inherited phaeochromocytoma susceptibility syndromes. [References: 85]

N2  - Urinary bladder paraganglioma (paraganglioma) is a rare tumor of chromaffin cells of the sympathetic system of the urinary bladder wall. We studied 14 cases of this entity and investigated the usefulness of SDHB protein staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a diagnostic tool to identify patients with bladder paragangliomas that could be associated with SDHB gene mutations, as these patients have a more aggressive disease. Eleven tumors from these patients were stained by IHC. Six of 11 tumors were negative for SDHB staining by IHC with no cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells when compared with normal tissues. Five of these 6 negative cases were confirmed to be positive for germline SDHB mutations. One case showed negative staining and no germline SDHB mutation; however, further investigation of the tumor revealed a somatic SDHB gene deletion. The remaining 5 cases showed strong cytoplasmic staining, but they were negative for the presence of SDHB mutation. They were found to be either sporadic tumors or part of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Staining for SDHA was positive in all cases. Our study confirms that there is very good correlation between the presence of an SDHB mutation, whether germline or sporadic, and negative SDHB IHC staining in urinary bladder paragangliomas, and this is the first study to demonstrate that somatic mutations can be recognized by IHC staining.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau is an autosomal dominant familial tumor syndrome with a risk of developing central nervous system and retinal hemangioblastomas, kidney cysts and clear cell carcinoma, cyst adenomas of other organs and pheochromocytoma. Despite continued elaboration of the neurobiologic role of the von Hippel-Lindau protein, the mainstay of management remains the definitive clinical diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (as distinct from sporadic cases of single von Hippel-Lindau-associated tumors), clinical monitoring and preemptive intervention by surgical or ablative therapy. Specific pharmacologic treatment awaits further biologic understanding of critical pathogenic components. Increasingly sensitive imaging and surgical techniques allow for optimum clinical management and intervention. This article will review von Hippel-Lindau molecular genetics, genotype-phenotype correlations and clinical classification, current understanding of the biology of the von Hippel-Lindau protein, its role in the pathophysiology of this disorder and the consequent implications for future therapeutic/interventional strategies. Central nervous system manifestations will be highlighted. [References: 138]

N2  - Background: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains the leading cause of mortality in patients with clear cell RCC arising from mutations in the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. Successful RCC tumor suppression by VHL requires the negative regulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF alpha) protein and its downstream targets. Thus, identification of HIF target genes responsible for RCC tumor progression will aid in the development of therapies for this disease. We previously identified membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) as a transcriptional target of HIF-2alpha in RCC cells null for VHL and showed that MT1-MMP is overexpressed in these cells. MT1-MMP is a key regulator of tumor progression through its functions as a matrix-degrading enzyme, as well as its ability to cleave factors, such as adhesion molecules and other MMPs. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of MT1-MMP to the invasive potential of RCC cells using in vitro type I collagen degradation and invasion assays. Results: We evaluated RCC cells wild-type (WT8) and null (pRc-9) for VHL for invasive characteristics and showed that the pRc-9 cells demonstrated a greater propensity for both invasion and degradation of a type I collagen matrix. Furthermore, overexpression of either HIF-2alpha or MT1-MMP in the poorly invasive cell line, WT8, promoted collagen degradation and invasion of these cells. Finally, using RNAi, we show that inhibition of MT1-MMP suppresses tumor cell invasion of RCC cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that MT1-MMP is a major mediator of tumor cell invasiveness and type I collagen degradation by VHL RCC cells that express either MT1-MMP or HIF-2alpha. As such, MT1-MMP may represent a novel target for anti-invasion therapy for this disease. Â© 2006 Petrella and Brinckerhoff; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is an important subtype of kidney cancer with a problematic pathological classification and highly variable clinical behaviour. Here we sequence the genomes or exomes of 31 pRCCs, and in four tumours, multi-region sequencing is undertaken. We identify BAP1, SETD2, ARID2 and Nrf2 pathway genes (KEAP1, NHE2L2 and CUL3) as probable drivers, together with at least eight other possible drivers. However, only ~10% of tumours harbour detectable pathogenic changes in any one driver gene, and where present, the mutations are often predicted to be present within cancer sub-clones. We specifically detect parallel evolution of multiple SETD2 mutations within different sub-regions of the same tumour. By contrast, large copy number gains of chromosomes 7, 12, 16 and 17 are usually early, monoclonal changes in pRCC evolution. The predominance of large copy number variants as the major drivers for pRCC highlights an unusual mode of tumorigenesis that may challenge precision medicine approaches.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome associated with mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene (3p25-26). Its estimated incidence ranges from 1 in 36,000 to 1 in 53,000 with a penetrance of up to 95% by age 60. Genotype-phenotype correlation divides VHL into two broad clinical subtypes. Type 1 VHL is predominantly associated with large deletion or truncation mutations which result in an encoded protein with very little or no activity. It is associated with retinal and CNS hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma but not pheochromocytoma. Type 2 is usually associated with missense mutations encoding a protein with limited activity and includes pheochromocytoma. It is further classified into three other subtypes (2A, 2B, 2C) based on the presence of hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma. Visceral cysts in the kidney, pancreas and epididymis, nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors which often show distinctive clear cell cytology, endolymphatic sac tumors and head and neck paragangliomas are well recognized but less common presenting features. Surveillance of carriers can reduce the burden of disease and is best performed in specialist referral centers with due consideration given to both the complex molecular pathogenesis and psychosocial aspects of the disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy worldwide. Changes in DNA methylation can cause silencing of normally active genes, especially tumour suppressor genes (TSG) or activation of normally silent genes. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree of promoter methylation for a panel of markers for thyroid neoplasms and to establish their relationship with thyroid oncogenesis. METHOD(S): To generate a comprehensive DNA methylation signature of TSGs involved in thyroid neoplasia, we use Human TSG EpiTect Methyl II Signature PCR Array-Qiagen for 24 samples (follicular adenomas and papillary thyroid carcinomas) compared with normal thyroid tissue. We extended the evaluation for three TSGs (TP73, WIF1, PDLIM4) using qMS-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism. RESULT(S): We noted four important genes NEUROG1, ESR1, RUNX3, MLH1, which presented methylated promoter in tumour samples compared to normal. We found new characteristic of thyroid tumours: methylation of TP73, WIF1 and PDLIM4 TSGs, which can contribute to thyroid neoplasia. A significant correlation between BRAF V600E mutation and RET/PTC rearrangements with TIMP3 and CDH13, RARB methylation, respectively was observed. CONCLUSION(S): TSGs promoter hypermethylation is a hallmark of cancer and a test that uses methylation quantification method is suitable for diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer.Copyright Â© 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

N2  - Introduction: Advanced imaging has led to an increase in the incidental diagnosis of pancreatic cysts. Serous cystadenomas (SCAs) account for nearly 30% of cases. These are typically considered benign lesions but up to 16% of cases are resected for aggressive behavior and symptoms. Presentation of case: A 64 year old female presented with a large incidental cyst in the pancreatic body. Pre-operative imaging conferred a diagnosis of SCA. After 2 years the cyst grew resulting in abdominal pain. Enlargement was associated with splenic vein occlusion and varices of the short gastric vessels. This change in behavior was concerning for malignant transformation. The cyst was resected by distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient recovered with minimal morbidity. Final pathology revealed a 15.5 x 10.3 x 8.5 cm SCA with negative margins. Discussion(s): In this case a patient presents with aggressive radiographic features and new symptoms suggesting malignant transformation of a previously diagnosed SCA on imaging. Although malignant variants can be diagnosed by findings of metastatic deposits at the time of surgery or as recurrence years later, histologic findings cannot discriminate benign from malignant potential. Preoperative imaging is challenging with erroneous characterization in nearly 60% of cases. Conclusion(s): Based on the low risk of malignancy, selective surgical resection for SCA appears warranted. Accepted indications for surgery include development of symptoms or concern for correct diagnosis in a medically fit individual. Routine resection for cysts >4 cm has been suggested however, prospective studies are needed to determine benefit over risk rationale.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors

N2  - MENX is a recessive multiple endocrine neoplasia-like syndrome in the rat. The tumor spectrum in MENX overlaps those of human multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 1 and 2. We mapped the MenX locus to the distal part of rat chromosome 4, excluding the homologs of the genes responsible for the MEN syndromes (RET and MEN1) and syndromes with an endocrine tumor component (VHL and NF1). We report the fine mapping of the disease locus and the identification of a homozygous frameshift mutation in Cdkn1b. encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. As a consequence of the mutation, MENX-affected rats show dramatic reduction in p27Kip1 protein. We have identified a germ-line non-sense mutation in the human CDKN1B gene in a MEN1 mutation-negative patient presenting with pituitary and parathyroid tumors. Expanded pedigree analysis shows that the mutation is associated with the development of an MEN1-like phenotype in multiple generations. Our findings demonstrate that germ-line mutations in p27kip1 can predispose to the development of multiple endocrine tumors in both rats and humans.

N2  - Long-term responders are defined by at least 18 months of response to sunitinib in metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Well-described by clinical studies, the phenotype of these tumors has never been explored. Primary tumors of long-term responders demonstrated a different phenotype with programmed death-ligand 1 low expression, suggesting a potentially lower impact of targeted immunotherapy in these patients., Background: Long-term responders (LTRs) are defined by at least 18 months of response to sunitinib in metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Well-described by clinical studies, the phenotype of these tumors has never been explored. Patients and Methods: In a retrospective and multicenter study, 90 ccRCCs of patients with metastatic disease were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (carbonic anhydrase IX, vascular endothelial growth factor, c-MET, programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1], and PD-1) and VHL status were performed. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated from sunitinib introduction and from progression. LTRs and their corresponding tumors were compared with others using univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): Twenty-eight patients were LTRs. They had a median progression-free survival of 28 months versus 4 months for other patients (P <.001). Similarly, LTRs had a median overall survival of 49 months versus 14 months (P <.001), even from progression (median, 21 vs. 7 months; P =.029). They were associated with a favorable or intermediate risk (International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium model) (P =.007) and less liver metastasis (P =.036). They experienced more frequent complete or partial responses at the first radiologic evaluation (P =.035). The corresponding ccRCCs were associated with less nucleolar International Society for Urological Pathology grade 4 (P =.037) and hilar fat infiltration (P =.006). They were also associated with low PD-L1 expression (P =.02). Only the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium model and PD-L1 expression remained significant after multivariate analysis (P =.014 and P =.029, respectively). Conclusion(s): Primary tumor characteristics of LTRs were studied for the first time and demonstrated a different phenotype. Interestingly, they were characterized by low expression of PD-L1, suggesting a potentially lower impact of targeted immunotherapy in these patients.Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objectives: Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor associated with several hereditary syndromes including VHL, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and neurofibromatosis. We report a patient with bilateral pheochromocytoma and the necessity for further screening. Method(s): The patient is a 9-year-old previously healthy male presented with hypertension, increasing BMI despite decreased height and weight, last three years. He had headaches, blurry vision, night sweats, and pubic hair. His studies showed normal BMP and TSH. An abdominal ultrasound showed bilateral suprarenal masses. An abdominal MRI confirmed the finding of bilateral adrenal masses measuring 3 x 2.7 x 2.5 cm in the right and 3.6 x 3.5 x 2.7 cm in the left. Both his plasma and 24 hour urine showed markedly elevated norepinephrine and metanephrines. His blood pressure was controlled with Amlodipine. Upon completing Texas Children's Hospital protocol for alpha and beta blockade, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed due to no clear plane between the tumor and the adrenal gland. He was discharged home 10.9 mg/msq of hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone. Result(s): The pathology resulted as bilateral pheochromocytoma. Based on the scoring system of Kimura, et al. the tumor was scored 4 and is considered moderately differentiated. Genetics testing showed p.V166F, a likely pathogenic variant in the VHL gene. The parents and siblings were negative for the gene mutation thus indicating that our patient has a De novo mutation. Conclusion(s): VHL syndrome is characterized by the development of tumors throughout the body including hemangioblastomas, renal clear cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma. VHL is caused by mutations in the VHL gene, a tumor suppressor gene. VHL is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. About 20% of patients have a De novo mutation. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of pheochromocytomas and genetic work-up for additional malignancies associated with VHL.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited multisystem familial cancer syndrome characterized, most commonly, by susceptibility to retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and renal and pancreatic cysts. Germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene can cause VHL disease, inherited pheochromocytoma, and autosomal recessively inherited polycythemia. Somatic mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene occur in most clear cell renal cell carcinoma and the VHL protein has a critical role in oxygen sensing and regulation of the hypoxic gene response.

N2  - Purpose: Protein levels and activity of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 are controlled by hydroxylation of the regulatory alpha chains. Proline hydroxylases (PHDs) target the protein for degradation via the von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-ubiquitin-ligase complex, and asparagine hydroxylation by Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH) leads to transcriptional inactivation. In cell-free systems, these enzymes require ascorbate as a cofactor, and this is also inferred to be an intracellular requirement for effective hydroxylation. However, how intracellular concentrations of ascorbate affect hydroxylase activity is unknown. In this study, we investigated the modulation of the regulatory hydroxylases in cancer cells by intracellular ascorbate. Materials and methods: To facilitate this investigation, we used clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines that were VHL-proficient (Caki-1), with a normal hypoxic response, or VHL-defective (Caki-2 and 786-0), with uncontrolled accumulation of HIF-alpha chains. We monitored the effect of intracellular ascorbate on the hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and the expression of downstream HIF targets BNIP3, cyclin D1 and GLUT1. Changes in hydroxylation of the HIF-1alpha protein in response to ascorbate were also investigated in 786-0 cells gene-modified to express full-length HIF-1alpha (786-HIF1). Results: In VHL-proficient cells, hypoxia induced accumulation of HIF-1alpha and BNIP3 which was dampened in mild hypoxia by elevated intracellular ascorbate. Increased HIF-2alpha accumulation occurred only under severe hypoxia and this was not modified by ascorbate availability. In VHL-defective cells, ascorbate supplementation induced additional accumulation of HIF under hypoxic conditions and HIF pathway proteins were unchanged by oxygen supply. In 786-HIF1 cells, levels of hydroxylated HIF-1alpha were elevated in response to increasing intracellular ascorbate levels. Conclusion: Our data provide evidence that the hypoxic pathway can be modulated by increasing HIF hydroxylase activity via intracellular ascorbate availability. In VHL-defective cells, accumulation of HIF-alpha proteins is independent of hydroxylation and is unaffected by intracellular ascorbate levels.

N2  - The introduction of molecular targeted agents has fundamentally changed the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A first wave of development was based on the improved understanding of tumor biology since the discovery of the importance of the von Hippel-Lindau gene as the key driver of the disease and paved the way for antiangiogenic agents. Of relevance is the overexpression of proangiogenic and proliferation-promoting factors (VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor) as well as an overactivation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway: the target structure is the "mammalian target of rapamycin" (mTOR) molecule, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferative processes. VEGF-, PDGF-, and mTOR-signals and signaling pathways are central targets of current targeted substances. A second wave is certainly to be seen in the development of therapeutic approaches with the targeted activation and modulation of the immune system, which has brought "immunotherapy" back into the focus of interest. Central development is the application of immune-checkpoint inhibitors, with the help of which (re-)activation of the cellular defense, especially of T cells, takes place, which per se holds the potential of a cytoreductive therapy by killing the tumor cells. Even though the prognosis has improved significantly due to the rapid development of recent years, treatment remains challenging as most patients experience progress, and long-term survival is only achieved in about 20% of cases because some patients are primarily refractory or do not respond. The more intensive interlocking of molecular biology, pathology, clinical research, and interdisciplinary uro-oncology, as is the claim of molecular tumor boards, can contribute to the individual selection of a suitable therapy strategy and, thus, establish the latest findings and developments for the benefit of patients in the clinic.

N2  - Background: von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a multisystem cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the VHL gene. Retinal hemangioblastoma is one of the most common tumours, and when it appears near the optic nerve, its treatment is challenging and risky. To date, no treatment has proven effective in changing the course of the disease. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of propranolol in controlling these tumours., Methods: Seven patients were included. All patients took a daily dose of 120 mg of propranolol for 1 year. Clinical variables were assessed at baseline, and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary endpoint of the study was the number and size of retinal hemangioblastomas. On every visit, retinal outcomes and blood biomarkers (such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and miR210) were analysed., Results: Number and size of retinal hemangioblastomas remained stable in all patients. All of them had initially increased levels of VEGF and miR210. There was a gradual reabsorption of retinal exudation in two patients, correlating with a progressive decrease of both biomarkers. The only adverse effect reported was hypotension in one patient., Conclusions: Propranolol could be used to treat retinal hemangioblastomas in VHL patients, although more studies are needed to determine the ideal dose and long-term effect. VEGF and miR210 should be explored as biomarkers of disease activity. As far as we know, these are the first biomarkers proposed to monitor the VHL disease activity., Trial registration number: 2014-003671-30.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The growth rate and natural history of untreated hemangioblastomas remain unclear. This study investigated the natural history of untreated intracranial hemangioblastomas and predictors of tumor growth using volumetric assessment., METHOD: This study retrospectively enrolled 31 patients with untreated hemangioblastomas between 2004 and 2017 who were followed up for at least 12 months. The 31 patients had a total of 52 hemangioblastomas., RESULTS: The 31 patients included 11 (35.5%) men and 20 (64.5%) women, of mean age 42.5 years. Seventeen (54.8%) patients were genetically diagnosed with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Of the 52 lesions, 33 (63.5%) grew during the follow-up period, whereas 19 (36.5%) remained stable. Overall mean actual growth rate (AGR) was 1.94 cm3/year, 2.38 cm3/year in the VHL and 1.79 cm3/year in the non-VHL group (p = 0.31). Overall mean relative growth rate (RGR) was 21%/year, 26%/year in the VHL and 19%/year in the non-VHL group. Time to 50% treatment probability was 34 months. The 1, 3, 5, and 7-year treatment probabilities were 11.5%, 50.1%, 52.7%, and 73%, respectively. The presence of only symptomatic lesions was significantly predictive of the growth of intracranial hemangioblastoma (odds ratio: 5.0, p = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: The overall growth rate of intracranial hemangioblastoma was faster than that of other benign intracranial tumors, with symptomatic lesions being the only meaningful predictor of tumor growth. Because of their rapid growth rate and high probability of treatment, a wait and scan management strategy should be carefully applied to intracranial hemangioblastomas.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nephron progenitors, the cell population that give rise to the functional unit of the kidney, are metabolically active and self-renew under glycolytic conditions. A switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration drives these cells toward differentiation, but the mechanisms that control this switch are poorly defined. Studies have demonstrated that kidney formation is highly dependent on oxygen concentration, which is largely regulated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL; a protein component of a ubiquitin ligase complex) and hypoxia-inducible factors (a family of transcription factors activated by hypoxia)., METHODS: To explore VHL as a regulator defining nephron progenitor self-renewal versus differentiation, we bred Six2-TGCtg mice with VHLlox/lox mice to generate mice with a conditional deletion of VHL from Six2+ nephron progenitors. We used histologic, immunofluorescence, RNA sequencing, and metabolic assays to characterize kidneys from these mice and controls during development and up to postnatal day 21., RESULTS: By embryonic day 15.5, kidneys of nephron progenitor cell-specific VHL knockout mice begin to exhibit reduced maturation of nephron progenitors. Compared with controls, VHL knockout kidneys are smaller and developmentally delayed by postnatal day 1, and have about half the number of glomeruli at postnatal day 21. VHL knockout nephron progenitors also exhibit persistent Six2 and Wt1 expression, as well as decreased mitochondrial respiration and prolonged reliance on glycolysis., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify a novel role for VHL in mediating nephron progenitor differentiation through metabolic regulation, and suggest that VHL is required for normal kidney development.

N2  - Reduced oxygenation of the outer retina in the aging eye may activate a chronic hypoxic response in RPE and photoreceptor cells and is considered as a risk factor for the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In mice, a chronically active hypoxic response in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or photoreceptors leads to age-dependent retinal degeneration. To identify proteins that may serve as accessible markers for a chronic hypoxic insult to photoreceptors, we used proteomics to determine the protein composition of the vitreous humor in genetically engineered mice that lack the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (Vhl) specifically in rods (rodDELTAVhl) or cones (all-coneDELTAVhl). Absence of VHL leads to constitutively active hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) and thus to a molecular response to hypoxia even in normal room air. To discriminate between the consequences of a local response in photoreceptors and systemic hypoxic effects, we also evaluated the vitreous proteome of wild type mice after exposure to acute hypoxia. 1'043 of the identified proteins were common to all three hypoxia models. 257, 258 and 356 proteins were significantly regulated after systemic hypoxia, in rodDELTAVhl and in all-coneDELTAVhl mice, respectively, at least at one of the analyzed time points. Only few of the regulated proteins were shared by the models indicating that the vitreous proteome is differentially affected by systemic hypoxia and the rod or cone-specific hypoxic response. Similarly, the distinct protein compositions in the individual genetic models at early and late time points suggest regulated, cell-specific and time-dependent processes. Among the proteins commonly regulated in the genetic models, guanylate binding protein 2 (GBP2) showed elevated levels in the vitreous that were accompanied by increased mRNA expression in the retina of both rodDELTAVhl and all-coneDELTAVhl mice. We hypothesize that some of the differentially regulated proteins at early time points may potentially be used as markers for the detection of a chronic hypoxic response of photoreceptors.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), a tumor suppressor gene, is frequently inactivated in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). It drives tumorigenesis by activating downstream hypoxia responsive genes and proangiogenic factors like VEGFR, and is responsible for the activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in RCC. Resistance to VEGFR therapy eventually occurs, in part due to activation of alternative signaling pathways like AXL and MET. Cabozantinib is a potent inhibitor of VEGF, AXL and MET receptors providing rationale for its use in RCC. Cabozantinib has been approved for use in the first- and second-line setting in patients with advanced RCC. This manuscript reviews the preclinical data, pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of the use of cabozantinib in RCC.

N2  - Protein ubiquitination is an important means of post-translational modification which plays an essential role in the regulation of various aspects of leukocyte development and function. The specificity of ubiquitin tagging to a protein substrate is determined by E3 ubiquitin ligases via defined E3-substrate interactions. In this review, we will focus on two E3 ligases, VHL and Itch, to discuss the latest progress in understanding their roles in the differentiation and function of CD4+ T helper cell subsets, the stability of regulatory T cells, effector function of CD8+ T cells, as well as the development and maturation of innate lymphoid cells. The biological implications of these E3 ubiquitin ligases will be highlighted in the context of normal and dysregulated immune responses including the control of homeostasis, inflammation, auto-immune responses and anti-tumor immunity. Further elucidation of the ubiquitin system in immune cells will help in the design of new therapeutic interventions for human immunological diseases and cancer.Copyright Â© 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Von Hippel-Landau (VHL) disease is characterized by malignant and benign tumors in multiple organs. Sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been clinically available for treating sporadic patients with recurrent or unresectable and metastatic clear renal cell carcinomas (cRCCs) and metastatic lesions of the lung, but its effect on VHL disease-associated tumors remains poorly understood. This retrospective case series examined the effect of sunitinib on RCC, hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in patients with confirmed VHL. Of note, three patients with VHL disease who were treated with sunitinib were identified from a review of their medical records. The efficacy of sunitinib was evaluated by comparing computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans conducted before and after treatment. Adverse side effects associated with sunitinib were assessed and recorded. All three patients with VHL disease exhibited clinical improvement after treatment with sunitinib. Patient 1 exhibited a decrease in the size of both their pheochromocytoma and RCC after 19 months of sunitinib treatment. RCCs in Patients 2 and 3 exhibited stable response to sunitinib for approximately 1 and 6 years, respectively. All the patients reported tolerable side effects. Therefore sunitinib treatment was associated with either partial response or stable control of VHL-related RCCs, pheochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with acceptable side effects. Further evaluation of sunitinib in patients with VHL disease in larger prospective studies is warranted.Copyright Â© 2018, Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Background: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) correlates with a worse prognosis, but whether it also predicts responsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy remains unclear. Most studies of PD-L1 are limited by evaluation in primary rather than metastatic sites, and in biopsy samples, which may not be representative. These limitations may be overcome with immuno-positron emission tomography (iPET), an emerging tool allowing the detection of cell surface proteins with radiolabeled antibodies. Here, we report iPET studies of PD-L1 in a preclinical tumorgraft model of clear cell RCC (ccRCC) from a patient who had a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Case presentation: A 49-year-old man underwent a cytoreductive nephrectomy in 2017 of a right kidney tumor invading into the adrenal gland that was metastatic to the lungs and a rib. Histological analyses revealed a ccRCC of ISUP grade 4 with extensive sarcomatoid features. IMDC risk group was poor. Within two hours of surgery, a tumor sample was implanted orthotopically into NOD/SCID mice. Consistent with an aggressive tumor, a renal mass was detected 18 days post-implantation. Histologically, the tumorgraft showed sarcomatoid differentiation and high levels of PD-L1, similar to the patient's tumor. PD-L1 was evaluated in subsequently transplanted mice using iPET and the results were compared to control mice implanted with a PD-L1-negative tumor. We labeled atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody with a mutant Fc, with zirconium-89. iPET revealed significantly higher 89Zr-atezolizumab uptake in index than control tumorgrafts. The patient was treated with high-dose IL2 initially, and subsequently with pazopanib, with rapidly progressive disease, but had a durable response with nivolumab. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-invasive detection of PD-L1 in renal cancer using molecular imaging. This study supports clinical evaluation of iPET to identify RCC patients with tumors deploying the PD-L1 checkpoint pathway who may be most likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 disrupting drugs.Copyright Â© 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: To provide an update summarizing the biologic pathways governing von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease pathogenesis and to provide an overview of systemic manifestations as well as screening recommendations. METHOD(S): A PubMed search of the English language literature was reviewed using the following search terms: von Hippel-Lindau, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and VHL. Of 6,696 publications, the most current and pertinent information related to the pathogenesis and systemic aspects of VHL disease were included in this review. RESULT(S): von Hippel-Lindau disease is one of the most frequently occurring multisystem familial cancer syndromes. The disease results from germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. Mutation in the VHL gene affects multiple cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix formation, apoptosis, and, in particular, the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia. As a result, there is widespread development of vascular tumors affecting the retina, brain, and spine, as well as a spectrum of benign and malignant tumors and/or cysts in visceral organs. CONCLUSION(S): The ophthalmologist plays a key role in VHL disease diagnosis, as retinal hemangioblastoma is frequently the first disease manifestation. Screening guidelines for individuals with known VHL disease, and those at risk of VHL disease, help to ensure early detection of potentially vision-threatening and life-threatening disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the germline variations of genes RET, VHL, SDHD and SDHB in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma and to evaluate variations of these genes in Chinese patients. METHODS: Patients who were treated in Peking University First Hospital from September 2012 to March 2014 and diagnosed with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma by pathologists were included in this study. Twelve patients were included in total, of whom 11 had pheochromocytoma, and 1 had paraganglioma. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the leukocytes of peripheral blood of the patients. The exons 10, 11, 13-16 of the RET gene, and all exons of VHL, SDHB and SDHD genes and their nearby introns (+/-20 bp) were amplified with polymerase chain reactions, and the products were sent to a biotechnology company for sequencing. The sequencing results were compared with wildtype sequences of these genes to identify variations. One of the patients was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. A family analysis was performed in his kindred, and his family members received genetic tests for the related variations. RESULTS: Three patients were found to have germline gene variations. A c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene was found in a patient with malignant pheochromocytoma. A c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation, as well as c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were found in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. After a family analysis, five family members of this patient were found to have the same variations. c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were also found in a clinical sporadic patient without evidence of malignancy. A patient with congenital single ventricle malformation and pheochromocytoma was included in this study, and no variation with clinical significance was found in the four genes of this patient. CONCLUSION: 25% (3/12) patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma were found to have missense or nonsense germline gene variations in this study, including the c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene, the c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation of the RET gene, and c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene. The former two variations have already been confirmed to be pathogenic. The existence of these variations in Chinese patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma was validated in this study, which supports the conclusion that genetic testing is necessary to be generally performed in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma.

N2  - PURPOSE: This is the first single-institution study of its size to characterize the treatment impact and to address the question of whether hemangioblastoma treatment with Gamma Knife Stereotactic Radiosurgery (GKRS) in both sporadic and VHL patients changes the characteristic saltatory hemangioblastoma growth pattern. METHODS: The authors reviewed a single-institution tumor registry to identify patients who had received GKRS for hemangioblastomas between January 1st, 1999, and December 31st, 2017. RESULTS: 15 patients with 101 lesions met search criteria with a median age of first GKRS of 39.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] of 25.7-57.4 years), including 96 VHL and 5 sporadic lesions. The median time from GKRS to last follow-up was 5.4 years (IQR 2.3-11.5 years). 4 lesions (4%) and 3 patients (20%) experienced a local failure. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year freedom from new hemangioblastoma formation rates were 97%, 80%, and 46% respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed a reduction in tumor volume after GKRS. Several variables associated with a greater percent reduction in volume from GKRS to last follow-up: non-cystic status (p = .01), no prior craniotomy (p = .04), and follow-up time from GKRS (p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a successful long-term treatment option for hemangioblastomas changing the clinical course from saltatory growth to reduction in tumor volume. Non-cystic tumors and those without prior craniotomy were associated with a greater percent reduction in volume from GKRS at last follow-up.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder that confers a lifelong risk for developing both benign and malignant tumours in multiple organs. Recent evidence suggests that vHL may exhibit genetic anticipation (GA). The aim of this study was to determine if GA occurs in vHL, and if telomere shortening may be a factor in GA. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of vHL families seen at The Hospital for Sick Children between 1984 and 2016 was performed. Age of onset (AOO, defined as the age of first physician-diagnosed vHL-related manifestation) was confirmed for 96 patients from 20 unrelated families (80 clinically affected and 16 unaffected carriers). Flow-FISH(flow cytometry sorting of cells whose telomeres are labeled by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) was used to measure mean telomere length of six white blood cell subtypes from 14 known VHL pathogenic variant carriers. RESULTS: The median AOO for generations I, II and III were 32.5, 22.5 and 12.0 years, respectively. The differences in the AOO between generations were highly significant using a Cox proportional hazards model (P=6.00x10<sup>-12</sup>). Telomere lengths were significantly different for granulocytes and natural killer lymphocytes of patients with vHL compared with age-matched controls. For six vHL parent-child pairs, median white blood cell telomere lengths between parent and child were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vHL telomere abnormalities may be primarily somatic in origin rather than a cause of GA. As tumour development exhibits GA in our cohort, vHL surveillance guidelines may need to account for a patient's generational position within a vHL pedigree.

N2  - It is definitively established that mutations in transcription factor HIF-2alpha are causative of both neuroendocrine tumors (class 1 disease) and polycythemia (class 2 disease). However, the molecular mechanism that underlies this emergent genotype-phenotype relationship has remained unclear. Here, we report the structure of HIF-2alpha peptide bound to pVHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) heterotrimeric complex, which shows topographical demarcation of class 1 and 2 mutations affecting residues predicted, and demonstrated via biophysical analyses, to differentially impact HIF-2alpha-pVHL interaction interface stability. Concordantly, biochemical experiments showed that class 1 mutations disrupt pVHL affinity to HIF-2alpha more adversely than class 2 mutations directly or indirectly via impeding PHD2-mediated hydroxylation. These findings suggest that neuroendocrine tumor pathogenesis requires a higher HIF-2alpha dose than polycythemia, which requires only a mild increase in HIF-2alpha activity. These biophysical data reveal a structural basis that underlies, and can be used to predict de novo, broad genotype-phenotype correlations in HIF-2alpha-driven disease.

N2  - Introduction: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and particularly its clear cell histological subtype, is commonly characterized by genetic alterations in the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, leading to a typically exasperated angiogenesis. However, other biological and genetic peculiarities contribute to differentiate this malignancy from other solid tumors, including its immunogenicity. Areas covered: This review focuses on the present and future role of antiangiogenic drugs, administered either alone (as it has been in the past few years), or in combination with other agents (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors), in the treatment of metastatic RCC. Expert commentary: Due to its peculiar pathogenesis, it is unrealistic to expect to be able to get rid of antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of this disease; however, we do expect that combinations of VEGF/VEGFRs-targeting agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors will gradually replace antiangiogenic monotherapies as the standard of care, at least in the first line setting of metastatic RCC patients. Biomarkers discovery remains the highest priority in order to further improve the percentage of patients benefitting of our treatment.

N2  - Renal cell cancer (RCC) has become a prototype example of the extensive intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution of human cancers. However, there is little direct evidence on how the genetic heterogeneity impacts on drug response profiles of the cancer cells. Our goal was to determine how genomic clonal evolution impacts drug responses. Finding from our study could help to define the challenge that clonal evolution poses on cancer therapy. We established multiple patient-derived cells (PDCs) from different tumor regions of four RCC patients, verified their clonal relationship to each other and to the uncultured tumor tissue by genome sequencing. Furthermore, comprehensive drug-sensitivity testing with 460 oncological drugs was performed on all PDC clones. The PDCs retained many cancer-specific copy number alterations and mutations in driver genes such as VHL, PBRM1, PIK3C2A, KMD5C and TSC2 genes. The drug testing highlighted vulnerability in the PDCs toward approved RCC drugs, such as the mTOR-inhibitor temsirolimus, but also novel sensitivities were uncovered. The individual PDC clones from different tumor regions in a patient showed distinct drug-response profiles, suggesting that genomic heterogeneity contributes to the variability in drug responses. Studies of multiple PDCs from a patient with cancer are informative for elucidating cancer heterogeneity and for the determination on how the genomic evolution is manifested in cancer drug responsiveness. This approach could facilitate tailoring of drugs and drug combinations to individual patients. Copyright Â© 2018 UICC

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NFPanNETs) may be sporadic or inherited because of germline mutations associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). The clinical behavior of NFPanNETs is difficult to predict, even in tumors of the same stage and grade. The authors analyzed genotype-specific patterns of transcriptional messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of NFPanNETs to understand the molecular features that determine PanNET phenotype. METHODS: Thirty-two samples were included for genome-wide mRNA gene expression analysis (9 VHL-associated, 10 MEN1-associated, and 9 sporadic NFPanNETs and 4 purified normal islet cell [NIC] samples). Validation of genes was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by tumor genotype, and pathway analysis was curated. RESULTS: Consensus clustering of mRNA expression revealed separate clustering of NICs, VHL-associated NFPanNETs, and MEN1-associated NFPanNETs; whereas some sporadic tumors clustered with MEN1. Four of 5 MEN1-like sporadic PanNET subtypes had loss of heterozygosity at the MEN1 gene locus. Pathway analysis demonstrated subtype-specific pathway activation, comprising angiogenesis and immune response in VHL; neuronal development in MEN1; protein ubiquitination in the new MEN1/sporadic subtype; and cytokinesis and cilium/microtubule development in sporadic NFPanNETs. Among many genes, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (Lef-1), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and CDK6 were upregulated in VHL or MEN1 NFPanNETs, providing potential subtype-specific treatment targets. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct mRNA expression patterns were identified in sporadic-associated, VHL-associated, and MEN1-associated NFPanNETs. The current results uncover new pathways involved in NFPanNETs that are subtype-specific and provide potential new diagnostic or therapeutic targets based on tumor subtype. Cancer 2018;124:636-47.

N2  - Trichloroethylene (TCE) and inorganic arsenic (iAs) are environmental contaminants that can target the kidney. Chronic exposure to TCE is associated with increased incidence of renal cell carcinoma, while co-exposure to TCE and iAs likely occurs in exposed human populations, such as those near Superfund sites. In order to better understand the kidney health consequences of TCE and/or iAs exposure, a genetically heterogeneous mouse population derived from FVB/NJ and CAST/EiJ mouse strains and deficient for multidrug resistance genes (Abcb1a<sup>tm1Bor</sup>, Abcb1b<sup>tm1Bor</sup> ) was chronically exposed for 52-weeks to varying concentrations of TCE and iAs. Although no exposure group resulted in primary renal cell tumors, kidneys from exposed mice did have significant increases in histologic and biochemical evidence of renal tubular disease with each toxicant alone and with combined exposure, with males having significantly higher levels of damage. Although no added increase in tubular disease was observed with combination exposure compared to single toxicants, molecular changes in kidneys from mice that had the combined exposure were similar to those previous observed in an embryonic stem cell assay for the P81S TCE-induced renal cell carcinoma mutation in the Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) gene.While this model more accurately reflects human exposure conditions, development of primary renal tumors observed in humans following chronic TCE exposure was not reproduced even after inclusion of genetic heterogeneity and co-carcinogenic iAs.

N2  - Exposure to hypoxia elicits a myriad of adaptive responses that are mediated by hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). An essential physiologic response to hypoxia is increase of production of erythrocytes necessary to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues; it has also been reported that the survival of erythrocyte may increase. Congenital defects of upregulation of the hypoxia-sensing pathway result in inappropriately elevated erythrocyte concentration. Evolutionarily, after many generations of living at high altitude, high altitude dwellers such as Tibetans, Andeans, and Ethiopians have selected genomic signatures, some in HIF pathway, enabling them to prosper in high altitude hypoxic environment. However, the entire diverse complex of molecular mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation is still largely unknown. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, resulting in formation of multiple systemic tumors. Juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma (JRCH) is one of the major manifestations in VHL disease; however, treatments are challenging, especially in children. The present study reports the case of a 6-year-old girl with suspected VHL disease presenting with JRCH. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated marked dye leakage from the tumor. Retinal hemorrhage occurred around the tumor 7 months later. Laser photocoagulation of the tumor tissue was safely and successfully conducted without general anesthesia. The hemorrhage diminished after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated mild resolution of an elevated lesion in JRCH with contraction of the vitreoretinal interface over the tumor. Laser photocoagulation may be considered the first-line treatment for young patients with JRCH, although the primary physicians must have the necessary skills and be able to establish good doctor-patient relationships, even with children.

N2  - Familiar cancers represent a privileged point of view for studying the complex cellular events inducing tumor transformation. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a familiar predisposition to develop cancer is a clear example. Here, we present our efforts to decipher the role of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) in cancer insurgence. We collected high quality information about both pVHL mutations and interactors to investigate the association between patient phenotypes, mutated protein surface and impaired interactions. Our data suggest that different phenotypes correlate with localized perturbations of the pVHL structure, with specific cell functions associated to different protein surfaces. We propose five different pVHL interfaces to be selectively involved in modulating proteins regulating gene expression, protein homeostasis as well as to address extracellular matrix (ECM) and ciliogenesis associated functions. These data were used to drive molecular docking of pVHL with its interactors and guide Petri net simulations of the most promising alterations. We predict that disruption of pVHL association with certain interactors can trigger tumor transformation, inducing metabolism imbalance and ECM remodeling. Collectively taken, our findings provide novel insights into VHL-associated tumorigenesis. This highly integrated in silico approach may help elucidate novel treatment paradigms for VHL disease.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that originate from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, and paragangliomas (PGLs) are extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. These can be mainly found in clinical syndromes including multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, neurofibromatosis-1 (NF-1) and familial paraganglioma (FPGL). PCCs and PGLs are thought to have the highest degree of heritability among human tumors, and it has been estimated that 60% of the patients have genetic abnormalities. This review provides an overview of the clinical syndrome and the genetic screening strategies of PCCs and PGLs. Comprehensive screening principles and strategies, along with specific screening based on clinical symptoms, biochemical tests and immunohistochemistry, are discussed.

N2  - Targeting the "undruggable" proteome remains one of the big challenges in drug discovery. Recent innovations in the field of targeted protein degradation and manipulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system open up new therapeutic approaches for disorders that cannot be targeted with conventional inhibitor paradigms. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bivalent ligands in which a compound that binds to the protein target of interest is connected to a second molecule that binds an E3 ligase via a linker. The E3 protein is usually either Cereblon or Von Hippel-Lindau. Several examples of selective PROTAC molecules with potent effect in cells and in vivo models have been reported. The degradation of specific proteins via these bivalent molecules is already allowing for the study of biochemical pathways and cell biology with more specificity than was possible with inhibitor compounds. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the field of small molecule mediated protein degradation, including transcription factors, kinases and nuclear receptors. We discuss the potential benefits of protein degradation over inhibition as well as the challenges that need to be overcome.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: To develop a radiomics model with all-relevant imaging features from multiphasic computed tomography (CT)for differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)from non-ccRCC, and to investigate the underlying molecular basis of the all-relevant imaging features by assessing their possible radiogenomics link with a key ccRCC driver gene - the VHL gene mutation. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective two-center study, 255 patients comprising 188 ccRCC and 67 non-ccRCC were included. 156 radiomics features were extracted from standardized triphasic CT. For differentiating ccRCC from non-ccRCC, two radiomics models were built using random forest from a training cohort (170 patients), where one model was built with all-relevant features selected by Boruta algorithm and the other with features selected by minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance ensemble (mRMRe)algorithm. A lassification model combing all-relevant features and clinical factors (sex and age)was also built using random forest. The potential radiogenomics association that linked the selected imaging features with the VHL mutation were investigated. All models were tested on an independent validation cohort (85 patients). Result(s): The radiomics model with eight all-relevant Boruta features (all from corticomedullary phase)achieved an AUC of 94.9% and an accuracy of 92.9% in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed the model with eight mRMRe features (seven from nephrographic phase and one from corticomedullary phase)with an AUC of 85.1% and an accuracy of 81.2% (p=0.023). Combining age and sex with all-relevant features did not benefit the classification performance. Seven out of eight selected all-relevant imaging features were significantly associated with VHL mutation, while all eight mRMRe imaging features were significantly associated with VHL mutation. The all-relevant radiomics model also succeeded in differentiating ccRCC from pRCC (AUC 99.1% and accuracy 95.9%)and from chRCC (AUC 90.7% and accuracy 93.2%), respectively. Conclusion(s): All-relevant radiomics features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC with high accuracy. These subtypediscriminative imaging features were found to be significantly associated with the VHL gene mutation. Copyright Â© 2019 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a monogenic disorder characterized by the development of tumors affecting the central nervous system, kidney, pancreas, or adrenal glands, and due to germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. About 5% of patients with a typical VHL phenotype have no mutation detected by conventional techniques, so a postzygotic VHL mosaicism can be suspected. The aim of this study was therefore to implement a next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategy for VHL mosaic mutation detection, including an optimization of the original Personal Genome Machine design by enrichment with oligonucleotides corresponding to amplicons with insufficient depth of coverage. Two complementary strategies were developed for the confirmation of mosaic mutations identified by NGS, SNaPshot for variants present at an allelic ratio greater than 5%, and droplet digital PCR for allelic ratio above 1%. VHL mutant plasmids were generated to assess VHL mosaic mutation detection in different exons and to set up an internal quality control that could be included in each run or regularly to validate the assay. This strategy was applied to 47 patients with a suggestive or clinical VHL disease, and mosaic mutations were identified in 8.5% of patients. In conclusion, NGS technologies combined with SNaPshot or droplet digital PCR allow the detection and confirmation of mosaic mutations in a clinical laboratory setting.

N2  - AIMS: Kinesin family member 11 (Kif11) is a member of the kinesin family motor proteins, which is associated with spindle formation and tumour genesis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kif11 expression and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) development. METHODS: The relationship between Kif11 expression and CCRCC development was analysed by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR analyses, and tissue immunohistochemistry. The prognostic significance of Kif11 expression was explored by univariable and multivariable survival analyses of 143 included patients. Furthermore, SB743921 was used as a specific Kif11 inhibitor to treat 786-O cells with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process analysed by qRT-PCR, and cell survival rates analysed with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining followed by flow cytometric analyses. Disease-free survival curves of Kif11 with different cancers and the relationships between Kif11 and the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor gene (VHL), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in kidney cancer were further analysed using the GEPIA database. RESULTS: The levels of Kif11 mRNA were significantly higher in CCRCC tissues compared with corresponding non-cancerous tissues. The results of immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the expression of Kif11 protein was significantly associated with clinicopathologial parameters, including nuclear grade and TNM stage. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated that high Kif11 expression, nuclear grade and TNM stage were independent factors to predict poor prognosis in patients with CCRCC. In addition, inhibition of Kif11 expression by SB743921 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and the EMT process with increased apoptosis rate. CONCLUSIONS: These results combined with bioinformation analyses suggest that high Kif11 expression was associated with unfavourable prognosis in CCRCC and could be used as a potential prognostic marker in the clinical diagnosis of CCRCC.

N2  - Tibetans have been living at altitudes over 3500 m for ~20,000 years and have developed unique beneficial evolutionary genetic adaptions (PMID:28448578). Our previous study identified selected genetic haplotypes in two genes, EPAS1 (encoding hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha [HIF2-a], a transcription factor that mediates the hypoxic response), and EGLN1 (encoding prolyl hydroxylase 2 [PHD2], a principal negative regulator of HIF stability (PMID:251 291 47). The presence of these two haplotypes correlates with lower hemoglobin levels in Tibetans compared to other highlanders. However, the entire diverse complex of molecular mechanisms of high altitude adaptation is still largely unknown and our study showed that neither EPAS1 nor EGLN1 variants fully explain the mechanism of protection from polycythemia in Tibetans in high altitude (PMID:28233034). We found an enriched haplotype in the PKLR gene (encoding pyruvate kinase [PK] expressed only in liver and red blood cells). The PK enzyme is in the terminal portion of the glycolytic pathway, and its decreased activity leads to accumulation of proximal glycolytic intermediates, including 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) which shifts the hemoglobin dissociation curve to right (high p50) and increases oxygen release to tissues from a unit of hemoglobin. We hypothesized that Tibetan enriched PKLR variants might improve oxygen delivery to tissues and help explain the protection from polycythemia at high altitude. Genomic analyses revealed that this PKLR haplotype is enriched in Tibetans but is not unique to Tibetans. It has the highest frequency in Tibetans (89%), with a lower prevalence in Chinese and Mongolians (~77%), Kyrgyz (~60 %), Aymara (~44 %), and Colombians (~30 %) and a much lower frequency in Caucasians (11%), perhaps explaining the heterogeneity of responses to hypoxia within and among these populations. Our study of reticulocyte RNA showed that transcript levels of PKLR progressively decrease with increasing altitude in controls and even more in Tibetans with the Tibetan evolutionary selected PKLR haplotype. Tibetans with the PKLR haplotype (heterozygotes and homozygotes) have lower PKLR transcript levels than wild type Tibetans. Because of the paucity of wildtype PKLR haplotype in Tibetans and the challenges of acquiring Tibetan samples in high altitude in China, we collected samples from 1 25 m (Cheboksary, Chuvashia); 800 m (Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan) and 2640 m (Bogota, Colombia). PK activity, PKLR transcript levels, and ATP decreased at 2640 m compared to 800 m, while p50 increased at 2640 m. PKLR transcript levels correlated with PK activity and ATP and inversely correlated with p50. PK activities also correlated with PKLR transcript levels and ATP and inversely correlated with p50. At 2640 m, PK activity was lower and p50 levels were higher in those with the enriched PKLR haplotype. These results demonstrate that increasing altitude decreases PK activity, resulting in increasing p50 providing a molecular basis for the previously reported improvement of oxygen delivery at high altitude (PMID:1 739441 5). To study the roles of HIFs in the regulation of PKLR gene expression, we also collected samples from Chuvash polycythemia (CP) homozygotes and Chuvash controls. CP homozygotes have a mutation in the VHL gene, a negative regulator of HIFs, that results in augmented HIF levels. CP homozygotes had lower PKLR mRNA in reticulocytes, PK activity, and PKR protein levels in red blood cells compared to controls, while their 2,3 DPG levels were higher. These data confirm that PKLR expression levels are negatively regulated by HIFs. Our findings demonstrate that individuals in high altitudes have lower PKLR transcript levels and PK activity, resulting in high 2,3DPG and p shifts the hemoglobin dissociation curve to right. This decreases affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, which improves tissue oxygen delivery and as such is another mechanism in Tibetans that protects from high altitude polycythemia. We also demonstrate that HIFs negatively regulate PKLR expression, leading to b tter oxygen release from hemoglobin at high altitude.

N2  - The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome has been rarely associated with renal oncocytomas, and tumors usually show HIF1alpha chronic stabilization. By contrast, oncocytomas mainly associated with respiratory chain (RC) defects due to severe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are incapable of stabilizing HIF1alpha, since oxygen consumption by the RC is dramatically diminished and prolylhydroxylase activity is increased by alpha-ketoglutarate accumulation following Krebs cycle slowdown. Here, we investigate the cooccurrence of a pseudohypoxic condition with oncocytic transformation in a case of VHL-associated renal oncocytoma. While HIF1alpha was abundant in nuclei concordantly with defects in VHL, negative staining of its targets carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and glucose transporter GLUT1, usually overexpressed in VHL-associated neoplasms, suggested HIF1alpha to be present in its inactive (hydroxylated) form. MtDNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry analyses revealed a MT-CO1 stop-gain mutation and cytochrome c oxidase loss. We suggest that a mitochondrial respiration impairment may lead to hyperhydroxylation of the transcription factor, which we confirmed by specific staining of hydroxylated HIF1alpha. Such inactive form hence accumulated in the VHL-deficient tumor, where it may contribute to the benign nature of the neoplasm. We propose that the protumorigenic role of HIF1alpha in VHL cancers may be blunted through drugs inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory complexes, such as metformin.

N2  - The data in genotype-phenotype correlation in Indian von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) patients is limited. We have retrospectively studied 31 genetically proven VHL patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PCC/PGL) from families and have reviewed the World literature on PCC/PGL in patients with large VHL deletions. Three patients had large deletions and 28 patients had other mutations [missense mutations in 25, 3 bp deletion in 2 and single bp duplication in one]. Unilateral PCC were significantly more common in patients with large VHL deletions whereas multiple PCC (bilateral PCC or PCC + sympathetic PGL) were significantly more common in those with other mutations. World literature review confirmed the rarity of PCC/PGL in patients with large deletions and we report the first definitive case of PCC associated with complete VHL deletion. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours were more common, often metastatic and the most common cause of death in our cohort. Our study had eight parent off-spring pairs from five families. The off-springs were significantly younger at presentation and had significantly higher number of PCC/PGL. In conclusion, PCC/PGL are rare in patients with large VHL deletions and if occur are most likely to be solitary. Patients with bilateral PCC or multifocal PCC/PGL are least likely to have large VHL deletions. Our study also provides additional evidence for existence of the phenomenon of anticipation in VHL syndrome.

N2  - Cancer cells preferentially metabolize glucose via the aerobic glycolysis pathway, which is also named as Warburg effect. Increasing evidence has suggested that suppression of glycolysis inhibits the progression of cancers. In this study, we found that the long non-coding RNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 (GHET1) was overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Up-regulation of GHET1 was positively correlated with the tumor size and metastasis of the ovarian cancer patients. Overexpression of GEHT1 significantly promoted the proliferation and colony formation of ovarian cancer cells. Mechanistically, the candidate binding partners of GHET1 were explored by pull down and mass spectrum. Of note, GHET1 was found to interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which consequently blocked VHL-mediated degradation of HIF1alpha and enhanced the protein level of HIF1alpha in ovarian cancer cells. The up-regulated HIF1alpha promoted the glucose uptake and lactate generation of ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggested the oncogenic function of GHET1 via up-regulating the glycolysis in ovarian cancer and can be considered as a promising anti-cancer target.

N2  - The regulation of oxygen (O<inf>2</inf>) levels is crucial in embryogenesis and adult life, as O<inf>2</inf> controls a multitude of key cellular functions. Low oxygen levels (hypoxia) are relevant for tissue physiology as they are integral to adequate metabolism regulation and cell fate. Hence, the hypoxia response is of utmost importance for cell, organ and organism function and is dependent on the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIF pathway activity is strictly regulated by the family of oxygen-sensitive HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins. Physiologic hypoxia is a hallmark of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche in the bone marrow. This niche facilitates HSC quiescence and survival. The present review focuses on current knowledge and the many open questions regarding the impact of PHDs/HIFs and other proteins of the hypoxia pathway on the HSC niche and on normal and malignant hematopoiesis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in several malignancies. However, the expression level and clinical significance of PD-L1 in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-associated hereditary clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surgical specimens were recruited from 129 patients with sporadic ccRCC and 26 patients with VHL-associated hereditary ccRCC. The PD-L1 expression level was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Correlations between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed. RESULTS: In sporadic ccRCC, the positive expression rate of PD-L1 was 47.3% (61/129). Positive PD-L1 expression was correlated with advanced tumor T stage (P = .011), higher Fuhrman nuclear grade (P = .022), poor disease-free survival (P = .037), and sex (P = .025). In the VHL-associated hereditary ccRCC, positive PD-L1 expression rate was 34.6% (9/26), lower than that in sporadic ccRCC. Positive PD-L1 was correlated with higher Fuhrman nuclear grade (P = .008), but not with sex, age, tumor stage, or the onset age of VHL-associated tumors. CONCLUSION: Positive PD-L1 expression was correlated with the aggressive clinicopathological features in sporadic and VHL-associated hereditary ccRCC. Whether PD-L1 expression level in ccRCC is related to the effectiveness of programmed death-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy needs to be further investigated.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the germline variations of genes RET, VHL, SDHD and SDHB in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma and to evaluate variations of these genes in Chinese patients. METHOD(S): Patients who were treated in Peking University First Hospital from September 2012 to March 2014 and diagnosed with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma by pathologists were included in this study. Twelve patients were included in total, of whom 11 had pheochromocytoma, and 1 had paraganglioma. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the leukocytes of peripheral blood of the patients. The exons 10, 11, 13-16 of the RET gene, and all exons of VHL, SDHB and SDHD genes and their nearby introns (+/-20 bp) were amplified with polymerase chain reactions, and the products were sent to a biotechnology company for sequencing. The sequencing results were compared with wildtype sequences of these genes to identify variations. One of the patients was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. A family analysis was performed in his kindred, and his family members received genetic tests for the related variations. RESULT(S): Three patients were found to have germline gene variations. A c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene was found in a patient with malignant pheochromocytoma. A c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation, as well as c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were found in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A. After a family analysis, five family members of this patient were found to have the same variations. c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene were also found in a clinical sporadic patient without evidence of malignancy. A patient with congenital single ventricle malformation and pheochromocytoma was included in this study, and no variation with clinical significance was found in the four genes of this patient. CONCLUSION(S): 25% (3/12) patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma were found to have missense or nonsense germline gene variations in this study, including the c.136C>T (p.R46X) variation of the SDHB gene, the c.1901G>A (C634Y) variation of the RET gene, and c.2071G>A (p.G691S) and c.2712C>G (p.S904S) variations of the RET gene. The former two variations have already been confirmed to be pathogenic. The existence of these variations in Chinese patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma was validated in this study, which supports the conclusion that genetic testing is necessary to be generally performed in patients with pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are tumors that arise from related neurally-derived cells of the autonomic nervous system. The World Health Organization classification of endocrine tumors arbitrarily reserves the name pheochromocytoma for tumors that arise from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Paragangliomas are similar tumors that occur throughout the distribution of sympathetic nerves and ganglia and along branches of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves in the head and neck. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas may be morphologically and functionally identical or may show functional differences associated with different anatomic sites. Recent molecular and genetic advances have led to greatly increased understanding of these tumors. It is now known that as many as 30% are hereditary. While some of the hereditary disorders, including von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), MEN2, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), have been well recognized for decades, recent discoveries have put a new focus on enzymes within the Krebs cycle, especially the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes. Pathogenic germline mutations in the genes encoding subunits of SDH, collectively known as SDHx genes, now account for the largest share of hereditary pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Moreover, SDH deficiencies have also been identified in gastrointestinal stromal tumor, renal cell carcinoma, and pituitary adenomaA - summarized in Table 2.1. Isocitrate dehydrogenase has also been implicated in a small number of cases. Germline mutations in at least 19 genes have now been identified, and many of these have also been reported to occur as somatic-only mutations in genuinely sporadic tumors. Given the newly recognized importance of heredity, prospective recognition, and accurate pathological diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and their syndromically associated tumors is now essential for patient care.

N2  - The neural crest (NC) is a transient, multipotent and migratory cell population that generates an astonishingly diverse array of cell types during vertebrate development. These cells, which originate from the ectoderm in a region lateral to the neural plate in the neural fold, give rise to neurons, glia, melanocytes, chondrocytes, smooth muscle cells, odontoblasts and neuroendocrine cells, among others. Neurocristopathies (NCP) are a class of pathologies occurring in vertebrates, especially in humans that result from the abnormal specification, migration, differentiation or death of neural crest cells during embryonic development. Various pigment, skin, thyroid and hearing disorders, craniofacial and heart abnormalities, malfunctions of the digestive tract and tumors can also be considered as neurocristopathies. In this review we revisit the current classification and propose a new way to classify NCP based on the embryonic origin of the affected tissues, on recent findings regarding the molecular mechanisms that drive NC formation, and on the increased complexity of current molecular embryology techniques.

N2  - Introduction Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a complex disorder, in which increased oxygen demand of tissues results in a complex setting of neoplastic disorders: i.e. clear cell renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hemangiomas, Lindau tumor, etc., usually appearing well before the age of forty, and usually without polyglobulia. The background of this disease are a series of mutation in VHL gene.This is positioned on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26). There are over 1500 germline mutations and somatic mutations found or identified in VHL disease. Some rare cases of mutated VHL gene might induce isolated polycythemia, interestingly these cases the other tumors are missing: so it is recommended to check VHL gene in polycythemia if aetiology otherwise not explained. Much less is known about non classical VHL mutations, but just simple VHL polymorphism issues (usually considered innocent, no clinical significance). Wen-Chu Wang et al. BMC Res Notes, 7:628, 2014, VHL polymorphism: Not at all are innocents, at least two single nucleotide polymorphisms of them are not insignificant on clinical grounds. For example Rs779805 polymorphism associates clear renal cell cancer in Taiwan and Mainland China more frequently, but, much less in caucasian population. Somewhat more prostatic and large bowel cancer have been found in this polymorphism, as well. VHL polymorphism Rs1642742: similar disorder association and geographic distribution. However, no blood count abnormalities mentioned in these Chinese reports. Patients and Methods We referred some patient samples gained from eastern Hungary (roughly 2 Million population) with polycythemia like syndrome without Jak2 V617F or exon 12 mutations, no mpl W515 mutation, with low or normal erythropoietin and O2 saturation values (during the past 4 years). We eagerly screened VHL gene in the patients especially if they were young (under 30) or there was evidence of familiar polyglobulia pattern or more cancer. VHL sequenations were performed: VHL gene coding regions: We performed the PCR amplification of intron (IVS1-195-nt) before 1st exon sequences PCR amplification, followed by direct fluorescent sequenation. This work had been performed by Zsuzsanna Bereczky, University Laboratory Medicine institute, her work is kindly acknowledged and highly appreciated Results 1. We have found, even to our surprise,13 patients or probands with the same VHL homo or heterozygous VHL polymorphism, namely the intron (IVS1-195-nt) before the 1st exon: i.e. rs779805 G>A, similar to what had been described in chinese population without blood count abnormalities (but associations with solid tumours) 2. None of the samples so far sequenced revealed true, classical VHL gene mutation. 3. We have found additional cancers in five families: clear renal cell cancer (1), large bowel cancer (2), melanoma (1) in the same family. more sporadic large bowel cancers, a single Hodgkin lymphoma, bony tumour, gynecological cancers (might or might not be coincidental). There were some patients (during family exploration) who had hemoglobin level over 190 g/L under the age of twenty. 4. Clinical features: Most patients were unusually young. High hemoglobin/red cell count was isolated in most instances, normal white blood cell or platelet counts. Aquagenic pruritus was usually absent, two cases had very mild, atypical itching. Spleen sizes were normal in all cases. In respect of transformation the two-four years observational period is irrelevantly short. Bone marrow examinations were performed in some cases, with normal description and analysis results. We used cautious phlebotomies, targeting 0,52 hematocrit levels. All of them were advised smoking cessation. We performed ultrasound and simple cancer screening on a yearly basis, which we do recommend further on. 5. by chance we identified one young polycythemia patients with same polymorphism and in addition Jak2 V617F mutated status. Conclusion(s): we do recommend VHL gene sequenation in young patients with otherwise unxplained polyglobulia, especially if there is any sign of familiarity, or unusual precipitation of cancer in the family. We are extending our family screening more deeply, and try to gain data on this polymorphism in 100 young healthy volunteers, analysing their bloofd counts and complex family history. We plan careful hematologic and oncologic followup of our patients and first degree relatives.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by various endocrine, nonendocrine, benign, and malignant tumors in various organs. VHL tumor suppressor gene, located on short arm of chromosome 3 is responsible for this. Pheochromocytoma (PCC) is one of the important endocrine manifestations that needs to be ruled out in case of VHL suspicion. In this review, we summarize the endocrine manifestations of VHL disease and their management while giving case history of five such cases.

N2  - Inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene is a highly frequent genetic event in the carcinogenesis of central nervous system-(CNS) hemangioblastomas (HBs). The patterning of the similar embryonic vasculogenesis is an increasing concern in HB-neovascularization, and the classic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis driven by VHL loss-of-function from human endothelium have been questioned. With this regard, we identify a distinct, VHL silencing-driven mechanism in which human vascular endothelial cells by means of increasing cell proliferation and decreasing cell apoptosis, is concomitant with facilitating accumulation of Twist1 protein in vascular endothelial cells in vitro. Importantly, this molecular mechanism is also pinpointed in CNS-HBs, and associated with the process of HB-neovascularization. In contrast with recent studies of HB-neovascularization, these modified cells did not endow with the typical features of vasculogenesis, indicating that this is a common angiogenesis implementing the formation of the vascular network. Taken together, these findings suggest that vasculogenesis and angiogenesis may constitute complementary mechanisms for HB-neovascularization, and could provide a rational recognition of single anti-angiogenic intervention including targeting to the Twist1 signalling for HBs.
