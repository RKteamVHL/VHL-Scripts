N2  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the pathogenicity of a gene variant of unknown significance (VUS) is crucial for molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling, but can be challenging. This is especially so in phenotypically variable diseases, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL). vHL is caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene, which predispose to the development of multiple tumors such as central nervous system hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).OBJECTIVE: We propose a method for the evaluation of VUS pathogenicity through our experience with the VHL missense mutation c.241C>T (p.P81S).METHOD: 1) Clinical evaluation of known variant carriers: We evaluated a family of five VHL p.P81S carriers, as well as the clinical characteristics of all the p.P81S carriers reported in the literature; 2) Evaluation of tumor tissue via genetic analysis, histology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC); 3) Assessment of the variant's impact on protein structure and function, using multiple databases, in silico algorithms, and reports of functional studies.RESULTS: Only one family member had clinical signs of vHL with early-onset RCC. IHC analysis showed no VHL protein expressed in the tumor, consistent with biallelic VHL inactivation. The majority of in silico algorithms reported p.P81S as possibly pathogenic in relation to vHL or RCC, but there were discrepancies. Functional studies suggest that p.P81S impairs the VHL protein's function.CONCLUSION: The VHL p.P81S mutation is most likely a low-penetrant pathogenic variant predisposing to RCC development. We suggest the above-mentioned method for VUS evaluation with use of different methods, especially a variety of in silico methods and tumor tissue analysis.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) features a Von Hippel-Lindau mutation, associated with a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) imbalance. Copper transporter 1 (CTR1) may also promote tumor progression through the modulation of the HIF pathway by copper. Therefore, the present study explored the prognostic effect of tumor CTR1 expression in patients with ccRCC. A total of 293 patients with ccRCC that underwent nephrectomy were retrospectively enrolled. CTR1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and its association with clinicopathological features and prognosis were evaluated. The present data indicated that high tumor CTR1 expression was independently associated with poor overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio, 2.291; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.389-3.777; P<0.001] and disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio, 2.210; 95% CI, 1.299-3.759; P=0.003) rates in patients with ccRCC. Furthermore, CTR1 expression was significantly higher for Mayo Clinic stage, size, grade and necrosis score risk groups, and could be incorporated into several existing prognostic models to improve performance. Nomograms incorporating tumor CTR1 expression with other parameters performed well in the 5- and 8-year OS and DFS rate predictions of patients (concordance index 0.805 and 0.787, respectively). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CTR1 expression is a potential independent biomarker for poor prognosis for the recurrence and survival prediction of patients with ccRCC following nephrectomy.

N2  - Small DNA tumor viruses typically encode proteins that either inactivate or degrade p53. Human adenoviruses encode products, including E4orf6 and E1B55K, that do both. Each independently binds to p53 and inhibits its ability to activate gene expression; however, in combination they induce p53 degradation by the ubiquitin pathway. We have shown previously that p53 degradation relies on interactions of E4orf6 with the cellular proteins Cul5, Rbx1, and elongins B and C to form an E3 ligase similar to the SCF and VBC complexes. Here we show that, like other elongin BC-interacting proteins, including elongin A, von Hippel-Lindau protein, and Muf1, the interaction of E4orf6 is mediated by the BC-box motif; however, E4orf6 uniquely utilizes two BC-box motifs for degradation of p53 and another target, Mre11. In addition, our data suggest that the interaction of E1B55K with E4orf6 depends on the ability of E4orf6 to form the E3 ligase complex and that such complex formation may be required for all E4orf6-E1B55K functions.

N2  - Over the past decade cancer-causing genes have been identified for the most common histologic types of renal cancer, specifically clear cell, papillary type 1 and papillary type 2. Genes predisposing to the more rare chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma were unknown until the recent discovery of a novel gene, BHD, on chromosome 17p that was found to be mutated in the germline of affected family members with the Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome. These patients develop the hallmark BHD skin lesions (fibrofolliculomas), lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax. Importantly, BHD patients have an increased risk for developing a variety of renal neoplasia, most commonly chromophobe and oncocytic hybrid tumors. This review will describe the phenotypic manifestations of BHD including the histologic features of BHD-associated renal tumors, the identification of this novel renal cancer-predisposing gene, the BHD mutation spectrum found in BHD patients, and will discuss the potential role of BHD as a tumor suppressor gene. © 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - We describe a primary clear cell microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity in a patient with Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL). The 39 year old patient had a molecularly-confirmed diagnosis of VHL-disease and had previous clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with resection/ablation over the past 10 years. He presented with epistaxis and was found to have an expansile mass in the ethmoid sinus and initial biopsy was reported as metastatic clear cell RCC. Full clinical staging showed no other metastatic disease. Tumour morphology demonstrated a tubulocystic pattern with abundant mucoid material and PAS-positive secretions within the cystic spaces. Sinonasal tumour cells had low grade nuclei, glycogenrich cytoplasm and a common brush border. Immunohistochemistry revealed tumour CD10 and RCC negativity and positive staining for CK7, CK20 and epithelial marker AE1/3. Comparison with the previous clear cell RCC showed dissimilar phenotypes and consensus was reached that the tumour was a primary low grade clear cell microcystic adenoma. There has been one previous case of a primary low grade clear cell microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity reported in a patient with VHL, with molecular analysis confirming tumour VHL-association. In the case we describe here, analysis of DNA extracted from tumour tissue showed no loss of the wild type allele at the VHL locus and did not support tumour association with VHL disease. It was not possible to look for a loss-of-function tumour mutation using dosage analysis, but gene sequencing showed that complete loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was unlikely due to heterozygosity for an intronic polymorphism. The association of primary low grade clear cell microcystic adenoma of the nasal cavity with VHL disease remains speculative. These lesions are benign but are likely to require regular surveillance and may require repeated surgical excision.

N2  - The treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has evolved significantly following the identification of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and the function of its protein, and subsequent development of antiangiogenic therapies. A series of clinical trials resulted in the approval of three new agents with significant activity in this disease. Additional studies are now underway to identify subsets of patients most likely to benefit. This article reviews the current therapy for advanced RCC and the development of biomarkers in RCC. This requires the identification of disease characteristics at a clinical, genetic and molecular level associated with response and/or surrogate measures of clinical benefit. Currently, a variety of prognostic factors (lactate dehydrogenase, performance status, disease-free interval, hemoglobin and calcium levels) are utilized to predict the survival of RCC patients. The use of validated biomarkers in either serum/plasma, urine or tissue could enhance this process, as well as define at the molecular and genetic levels, factors associated with response to therapy and/or the development of resistance. Examples include plasma VEGF levels, VHL gene mutation status and carbonic anhydrase IX levels in tumor tissue, among others. Validation of such biomarkers is crucial in order for them to be clinically useful. [References: 38]

N2  - Objective-Atherosclerosis develops near branches and bends of arteries that are exposed to low shear stress (mechanical drag). These sites are characterized by excessive endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and inflammation that promote lesion initiation. The transcription factor HIF1a (hypoxia-inducible factor 1a) is canonically activated by hypoxia and has a role in plaque neovascularization. We studied the influence of shear stress on HIF1a activation and the contribution of this noncanonical pathway to lesion initiation. Approach and Results-Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and en face staining revealed that HIF1a was expressed preferentially at low shear stress regions of porcine and murine arteries. Low shear stress induced HIF1a in cultured EC in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. The mechanism involves the transcription factor nuclear factor-B that induced HIF1a transcripts and induction of the deubiquitinating enzyme Cezanne that stabilized HIF1a protein. Gene silencing revealed that HIF1a enhanced proliferation and inflammatory activation in EC exposed to low shear stress via induction of glycolysis enzymes. We validated this observation by imposing low shear stress in murine carotid arteries (partial ligation) that upregulated the expression of HIF1a, glycolysis enzymes, and inflammatory genes and enhanced EC proliferation. EC-specifc genetic deletion of HIF1ain hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E?defecient mice reduced inflammation and endothelial proliferation in partially ligated arteries, indicating that HIF1a drives inflammation and vascular dysfunction at low shear stress regions. Conclusions-Mechanical low shear stress activates HIF1a at atheroprone regions of arteries via nuclear factor-B and Cezanne. HIF1a promotes atherosclerosis initiation at these sites by inducing excessive EC proliferation and inflammation via the induction of glycolysis enzymes.

N2  - A patient with germline von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene alteration and history of multiple tumors present with classical paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). She underwent open nephron sparing surgery with resolution of symptoms. She remained without recurrence of RCC for the initial 2 years of her follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first in which PNS was specifically resolved using a partial nephrectomy in a patient with VHL. This case report provides initial evidence for the potential role of nephron sparing surgery in the management of paraneoplastic symptoms associated with hereditary RCC.

N2  - In a previous study we reported that methylation within the promoter region of p53 was altered in human lung A549 cells exposed to arsenite over a 2-week period in culture. In the present study the methylation status of the 5' control region of the tumor suppressor gene, von Hippel Lindau syndrome (VHL), a gene known to be silenced transcriptionally by CpG methylation was assessed. No changes in DNA methylation in VHL in human kidney UOK cell lines exposed to arsenite were seen after 4 weeks in culture, assessed by simple HpaII digestion followed by PCR amplification. Using methylation-sensitive arbitrarily-primed PCR we identified eight differentially methylated regions of genomic DNA of ~ 300-500 bp from three UOK cell lines and from human lung A549 cells after arsenite exposure in culture. Six fragments were hypermethylated, and two were hypomethylated, relative to untreated controls. Sequence analysis revealed two DNA fragments contained repeat sequences of mammalian-apparent LTR retrotransposons, five contained promoter-like sequences, and 13 CpG islands were identified. Three fragments had 99-100% homology to regions on human chromosomes 6, 9, and 15 but these genes have not yet been identified. Our findings are consistent with a potential role for both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of DNA that coexist after exposure to arsenite. The results, in total, could support the existence of a state of DNA methylation imbalance that could conceivably disrupt appropriate gene expression in arsenite exposed cells. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Neurocutaneous syndromes encompasses a broad group of genetic disorders with different clinical, genetic, and pathologic features that share developmental lesions of the skin as well as central and peripheral nervous system. Cerebellar involvement has been shown in numerous types of neurocutaneous syndrome. It may help or be needed for the diagnosis and to explain the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of affected children. This article describes various types of neurocutaneous syndrome with cerebellar involvement. For each neurocutaneous disease or syndrome, clinical features, genetic, neuroimaging findings, and the potential role of the cerebellar involvement is discussed. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The etiologies of brain tumors are in the most cases unknown, but improvements in genetics and DNA screening have helped to identify a wide range of brain tumor predisposition disorders. In this review we are discussing some of the most common predisposition disorders, namely: neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2, schwannomatosis, rhabdoid tumor predisposition disorder, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin), tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau, Li-Fraumeni and Turcot syndromes. Recent findings from the GLIOGENE collaboration and the newly identified glioma causing gene POT1, will also be discussed. Genetics. We will describe these disorders from a genetic and clinical standpoint, focusing on the difference in clinical symptoms depending on the underlying gene or germline mutation. Central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Most of these disorders predispose the carriers to a wide range of symptoms. Herein, we will focus particularly on tumors affecting the CNS and discuss improvements of targeted therapy for the particular disorders.

N2  - <b>Introduction:</b> To address the issue of limited data on and inconsistent findings for genetic alterations in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs), we analyzed sequences of known pNET-associated genes for their impact on clinical outcomes in a Taiwanese cohort. <b>Methods:</b> Tissue samples from 40 patients with sporadic pNETs were sequenced using a customized sequencing panel that analyzed 43 genes with either an established or potential association with pNETs. Genetic mutations and clinical outcomes were analyzed for potential associations. <b>Results:</b> Thirty-three patients (82.5%) survived for a median 5.9 years (range, 0.3-18.4) of follow up. The median number of mutations per patient was 3 (range, 0-16). The most frequent mutations were in ATRX (28%), MEN1 (28%), ASCL1 (28%), TP53 (20%), mTOR (20%), ARID1A (20%), and VHL (20%). The mutation frequencies in the MEN1 (including MEN1/PSIP1/ARID1A), mTOR (including mTOR/PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN /TS1/TSC2/ATM), DAXX/ATRX, and angiogenesis (including VHL/ANGPT1/ANGPT2 /HIF1A) pathways were 48%, 48%, 38%, and 45%, respectively. Mutations in ATRX were associated with WHO grade I pNET (vs. grade II or III, p = 0.043), and so were those in genes involved in angiogenesis (p = 0.002). Patients with mutated MEN1 and DAXX/ATRX pathways showed a trend toward better survival, compared to patients with the wild-type genes (p = 0.08 and 0.12, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> Genetic profiles of Asian patients with pNETs were distinct from Caucasian patient profiles. Asian patients with pNETs were more frequently mutated for the mTOR and angiogenesis pathways. This could partially explain the better outcome observed for targeted therapy in Asian patients with pNETs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of molecular markers in renal cell carcinoma has been investigated in several studies. Although their value is still not confirmed, various proteins are important. We describe the effect on long-term survival of the status of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-alpha) signaling pathway as well as associated mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]1/2 and ERK5).PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 50 patients diagnosed with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma to analyze VHL mutations and hypermethylation as well as VHL, HIF1-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), ERK1/2, and ERK5 protein expression. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression- or recurrence-free survival (PFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Mantel-Haenszel was used for comparisons, and Cox proportional risk models were also constructed.RESULTS: Follow-up was 66.9 months. There were 23 (46.0%) deaths, of which 17 (73.9%) were caused by the tumor. Mean periods were 85.6 months for OS and 94.3 months for DSS. A total of 22 (44.0%) patients showed progression (PFS, 78.1 months). VHL expression (P = .045) and > 10% of HIF1-alpha expression (P = .034) were associated with greater OS. DSS was greater in patients without VHL methylation (P = .012), with > 10% HIF1-alpha expression (P = .037), or with ERK5 protein underexpression. Greater PFS was associated with absence of VHL methylation (P = .045), presence of VHL expression (P < .0001), HIF1-alpha expression > 10% (P = .04), and ERK5 protein underexpression (P = .011). The presence of VHL mutation and/or methylation and VEGF expression had no prognostic value. Fuhrman nuclear grade and Tumor, Node, Metastases (TNM) stage were the only variables that remained in the Cox model.CONCLUSION: The HIF1-alpha and ERK5 pathway has prognostic value. Patients with no VHL or HIF1-alpha expression and ERK5 overexpression had a worse course of disease. VHL or VEGF status had no prognostic value. Only TNM stage and Fuhrman nuclear grade remained in the Cox model and, therefore, are still essential in prognostic biomarker panels.

N2  - Cancer stem cells evade apoptotic death by blebbishield emergency program, which constructs blebbishields from apoptotic bodies and drives cellular transformation. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) plays both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles, and the reason behind is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that dimers and trimers of p19-VHL interact with RalBP1 to construct blebbishields. Expression of RalBP1, p19-VHL, and high-molecular weight VHL is required to evade apoptosis by blebbishield-mediated transformation. In contrast, p30-VHL plays a tumor suppressor role by inhibiting blebbishield-mediated transformation. Furthermore, target genes of VHL that suppress oxidative stress were elevated during blebbishield-mediated cellular transformation. Thus, RalBP1 and p19-VHL play an oncogenic role, whereas p30-VHL plays a tumor suppressor role during the blebbishield emergency program by regulating oxidative stress management genes.

N2  - Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), is known to play an important role in the development of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Even if available targeted therapies for metastatic RCCs (mRCCs) have helped to improve progression-free survival rates, they have no durable clinical response. We have previously shown the feasibility of specifically targeting the loss of VHL with the identification of a small molecule, STF-62247. Understanding its functionality is crucial for developing durable personalized therapeutic agents differing from those available targeting hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-) pathways. By using SILAC proteomics, we identified 755 deregulated proteins in response to STF-62247 that were further analyzed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Bioinformatics analyses predicted alterations in 37 signaling pathways in VHL-null cells in response to treatment. Validation of some altered pathways shows that STF-62247's selectivity is linked to an important inhibition of mTORC1 activation in VHL-null cells leading to protein synthesis arrest, a mechanism differing from two allosteric inhibitors Rapamycin and Everolimus. Altogether, our study identified signaling cascades driving STF-62247 response and brings further knowledge for this molecule that shows selectivity for the loss of VHL. The use of a global SILAC approach was successful in identifying novel affected signaling pathways that could be exploited for the development of new personalized therapeutic strategies to target VHL-inactivated RCCs.

N2  - The management of hereditary pheochromocytoma has drastically evolved in the last 20 years. Bilateral pheochromocytoma does not increase mortality in MEN2 or von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutation carriers who are followed regularly, but these mutations induce major morbidities if total bilateral adrenalectomy is performed. Cortical sparing adrenal surgery may be proposed to avoid definitive adrenal insufficiency. The surgical goal is to leave sufficient cortical tissue to avoid glucocorticoid replacement therapy. This approach was achieved by the progressive experience of minimally invasive surgery via the transperitoneal or retroperitoneal route. Cortical sparing adrenal surgery exhibits <5% significant recurrence after 10 years of follow-up and normal glucocorticoid function in more than 50% of the cases. Therefore, cortical sparing adrenal surgery should be systematically considered in the management of all patients with MEN2 or VHL hereditary pheochromocytoma. Hereditary pheochromocytoma is a rare disease, and a randomized trial comparing cortical sparing vs classical adrenalectomy is probably not possible. This lack of data most likely explains why cortical sparing surgery has not been adopted in most expert centers that perform at least 20 procedures per year for the treatment of this disease. This review examined recent data to provide insight into the technique, its indications, and the results and subsequent follow-up in the management of patients with hereditary pheochromocytoma with a special emphasis on MEN2.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are rare diseases but are also amongst the most characterized tumour types. Hence, patients with PPGL have greatly benefited from precision medicine for more than two decades. According to current molecular biology and genetics-based taxonomy, PPGL can be divided into three different clusters characterized by: Krebs cycle reprogramming with oncometabolite accumulation or depletion (group 1a); activation of the (pseudo)hypoxia signalling pathway with increased tumour cell proliferation, invasiveness and migration (group 1b); and aberrant kinase signalling causing a pro-mitogenic and anti-apoptotic state (group 2). Categorization into these clusters is highly dependent on mutation subtypes. At least 12 different syndromes with distinct genetic causes, phenotypes and outcomes have been described. Genetic screening tests have a documented benefit, as different PPGL syndromes require specific approaches for optimal diagnosis and localization of various syndrome-related tumours. Genotype-tailored treatment options, follow-up and preventive care are being investigated. Future new developments in precision medicine for PPGL will mainly focus on further identification of driver mechanisms behind both disease initiation and malignant progression. Identification of novel druggable targets and prospective validation of treatment options are eagerly awaited. To achieve these goals, we predict that collaborative large-scale studies will be needed: Pheochromocytoma may provide an example for developing precision medicine in orphan diseases that could ultimately aid in similar efforts for other rare conditions.

N2  - Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) functions as a transcription factor for genes involved in estrogen-dependent development of breast cancer cells. We demonstrate here that knockdown of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2alpha, but not of HIF-1alpha, increases endogenous ERalpha protein expression in normoxia and hypoxia. The von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-dependent degradation of HIF-2alpha participates in the regulation of ERalpha expression. Additionally, HIF-2alpha forms a protein complex with ERalpha, and amino acids 396-823 of HIF-2alpha physically interact with the ligand-binding domain of ERalpha. These results indicate that HIF-2alpha functions as a negative regulator of ERalpha expression in breast cancer, especially in normoxia.

N2  - Patients of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease frequently develop clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Using archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, we sought to determine global proteome alterations that distinguish ccRCC tissue from adjacent, non-malignant kidney tissue in VHL-patients. Our quantitative proteomic analysis clearly discriminated tumor and non-malignant tissue. Significantly dysregulated proteins were distinguished using the linear models for microarray data algorithm. In the ccRCC tissue, we noticed a predominant under-representation of proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and an increase in proteins involved in glycolysis. This profile possibly represents a proteomic fingerprint of the "Warburg effect", which is a molecular hallmark of ccRCC. Furthermore, we observed an increase in proteins involved in extracellular matrix organization. We also noticed differential expression of many exoproteases in the ccRCC tissue. Of particular note were opposing alterations of Xaa-Pro Aminopeptidases-1 and -2 (XPNPEP-1 and -2): a strong decrease of XPNPEP-2 in ccRCC was accompanied by abundant presence of the related protease XPNPEP-1. In both cases, we corroborated the proteomic results by immunohistochemical analysis of ccRCC and adjacent, non-malignant kidney tissue of VHL patients. To functionally investigate the role of XPNPEP-1 in ccRCC, we performed small-hairpin RNA mediated XPNPEP-1 expression silencing in 786-O ccRCC cells harboring a mutated VHL gene. We found that XPNPEP-1 expression dampens cellular proliferation and migration. These results suggest that XPNPEP-1 is likely an anti-target in ccRCC. Methodologically, our work further validates the robustness of using FFPE material for quantitative proteomics.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a familial neoplasia syndrome associated with multisystem tumor development. Depending on tumor type and location, current treatments for VHL-associated tumors can include a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of VHL include craniospinal hemangioblastomas and endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs). While the first-line treatment for both types of VHL-associated CNS tumors is surgery, the indications for treatment are patient specific and different for each tumor type. Although early sign/symptom formation is the primary indication for resection of craniospinal hemangioblastomas, radiographic discovery (asymptomatic and symptomatic) of ELSTs can be an indication for resection of ELSTs in VHL patients. Recently, research has revealed that specific VHL germline mutations may permit targeted medical treatments of not only CNS manifestations of VHL-associated tumors but also visceral tumors. Specifically, missense mutations can result in the translation of functional VHL protein (pVHL) that is rapidly degraded resulting in functional loss of the pVHL, and inhibitors of pVHL degradation may slow protein degradation and restore pVHL function. Emerging research will investigate the safety and practicality of using potential targeted therapies.

N2  - The phakomatoses, encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis (ETA; Sturge-Weber Syndrome), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 or von Recklinghausen disease), Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC), oculodermal melanocytosis (ODM), and phakomatosis pigmentovascularis are a group of neurocutaneous disorders that have characteristic systemic and ocular manifestations. Through many different mechanisms, they may cause glaucomatous damage of the optic nerve and subsequent vision loss varying from mild to severe. Glaucoma commonly affects patients with ETA (43-72%), orbito-facial NF1 (23-50%), and ODM (10%). Rarely, it may present as neovascular glaucoma in VHL and TSC. In ETA, glaucoma typically occurs ipsilateral to the port-wine stain, which is caused by a mutation in the GNAQ gene. Specifically, mechanical malformation of the anterior chamber angle and elevated episcleral venous pressure has been implicated as causes of glaucoma in ETA. In NF1, which is caused by a mutation in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, glaucoma commonly occurs ipsilateral to lid plexiform neurofibromas. Histological studies of eyes with NF1 have revealed direct anterior chamber infiltration by neurofibromas, secondary angle closure, fibrovascularization, and developmental angle abnormalities as mechanisms of glaucoma. Lastly, phakomatosis pigmentovascularis is a rare combination of ODM and port-wine stain. Affected patients are at very high risk of developing glaucoma. Despite the many different mechanisms of glaucomatous damage, management follows similar principles as that for congenital glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma. First-line therapy is topical intraocular pressure-lowering eye drops. Surgical management, including goniotomy, trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, and tube shunt placement may be required for more severe cases.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is a rare hereditary tumour predisposition with multiorgan involvement that is not always easily recognized. The disease is reported to be almost fully penetrant at age 60 years. Previous estimates of vHL prevalence and incidence are all regional and vary widely. Most are >20 years old and prone to selection bias because of inclusion of only clinically affected vHL patients who were diagnosed before genetic testing was available. In an unselected cohort of all known Danish carriers of a disease-causing VHL variant, we assessed vHL penetrance on a national basis. We further used national health registers to identify individuals who fulfilled the clinical diagnostic vHL criteria based on their registered diagnostic codes, but had not been diagnosed with vHL. We also assessed the medical histories of first-degree relatives to identify familial cases. This study gives the first national estimates of vHL prevalence (1 in 46900 individuals) and birth incidence (1 in 27300 live births). vHL has been underdiagnosed in Denmark, and as many as 25% of the overall vHL cohort (diagnosed+undiagnosed patients) have a missed diagnosis in spite of fulfilling the international diagnostic criteria. We found an overall penetrance of 87% at age 60 years. When considering only vHL patients who have not attended surveillance, 20% will still be asymptomatic at age 60 years. This should be considered in the context of genetic counselling, especially when assessing the risk of vHL in asymptomatic adult first-degree relatives who are often not genetically tested.

N2  - Cancer-specific metabolic alterations are of high interest as therapeutic targets. These alterations vary between tumor types, and to employ metabolic targeting to its fullest potential there is a need for robust methods that identify candidate targetable metabolic pathways in individual cancers. Currently, such methods include <sup>13</sup>C-tracing studies and mass spectrometry/ magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Due to high cost and complexity, such studies are restricted to a research setting. We here present the validation of a novel technique of metabolic profiling, based on multiplex targeted next generation sequencing of RNA with single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), designed to measure activity of and mutations in genes that encode metabolic enzymes. We here profiled an isogenic pair of cell lines, differing in expression of the Von Hippel Lindau protein, an important regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes. We show that smMIP-profiling provides relevant information on active metabolic pathways. Because smMIP-based targeted RNAseq is cost-effective and can be applied in a medium high-throughput setting (200 samples can be profiled simultaneously in one next generation sequencing run) it is a highly interesting approach for profiling of the activity of genes of interest, including those regulating metabolism, in a routine patient care setting.

N2  - Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is a transcription factor that plays an important role in many biological functions. Regulation of NF-kappaB activity is complicated, and ubiquitination is essential for NF-kappaB activation. Hypoxia can activate NF-kappaB. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. pVHL is a tumour suppressor and functions as an adaptor of E3-ligase. In this study, we demonstrated that pVHL inhibits NF-kappaB by mediating K63-ubiquitination of IKKbeta, which is dependent on oxygen. We found that pVHL mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of IKKbeta, which is an upstream regulator of NF-kappaB. The pVHL-mediated K63-ubiquitination of IKKbeta prevents TAK1 binding, which leads to the inhibition of IKKbeta phosphorylation and NF-kappaB activation. pVHL-mediated K63-ubiquitination of IKKbeta is inhibited under hypoxia. DMOG, which is a specific inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylases, also suppresses K63-ubiquitination of IKKbeta. Prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) 1 enhances K63-ubiquitination of IKKbeta and inhibits IKKbeta phosphorylation. These results suggest a novel function for pVHL in mediating K63-linked ubiquitination of IKKbeta, which plays a role in the regulation of IKK/NF-kappaB signalling. The results also provide new insight into the mechanism of NF-kappaB activation through hypoxia.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) represents a novel antitumor target owing to its involvement in vital processes considered hallmarks of cancer phenotypes. Manassantin A (MA) derived from Saururus cernuus has been reported as a selective HIF-1 inhibitor. Herein, the structure of MA was optimized to achieve new derivatives with simple chemical properties while retaining its activity. LXY6090 was designed to replace the central tetrahydrofuran moiety of MA with a cyclopentane ring and was identified as a potent HIF-1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 4.11 nM. It not only inhibited the activity of HIF-1 in breast cancer cells but also downregulated the protein level of HIF-1alpha, which depended on von Hippel-Lindau for proteasome degradation. The related biological evaluation showed that the activity of HIF-1 target genes, VEGF and IGF-2, was decreased by LXY6090 in breast cancer cell lines. LXY6090 presented potent antitumor activity in vitro. Furthermore, LXY6090 showed in vivo anticancer efficacy by decreasing the HIF-1alpha expression in nude mice bearing MX-1 tumor xenografts. In conclusion, our data provide a basis for the future development of the novel compound LXY6090 as a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer.

N2  - Paragangliomas of the organ of Zuckerkandl (OZ-PGL) are rare tumors that, in >70% of cases, occur in association with succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B (SDHB) or SDHD gene mutations. The aim of the current study was to determine whether a somatic genetic defect in the hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2alpha) gene was present in a case of sporadic OZ-PGL. A 32-year-old African female presented with uncontrolled hypertension during the first trimester of pregnancy. A diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed 3 months after delivery, precipitating a hypertensive crisis. Thereafter, the patient was diagnosed with noradrenaline-secreting OZ-PGL. A complete blood count identified mild normocytic anemia of an inflammatory origin. Surgical removal of the tumor resulted in normalization of plasma and urinary normetanephrine levels. Genetic testing for germline mutations (including large deletions) in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD genes was normal. However, a heterozygous missense mutation (c.1589Cys>Tyr) was detected in exon 12 of HIF2alpha, which results in a substitution of alanine 530 with valine (Ala530Val) in the HIF2alpha protein. A germline mutation was excluded based on the negative results of blood DNA testing. A three-dimensional homology model of Ala530Val was constructed, which showed impaired HIF2alpha/VHL interaction and decreased HIF2alpha ubiquitination. <sup>1</sup>H-high-resolution magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy detected low succinate levels and high alpha and beta glucose levels. To the best of our knowledge, the present case represents the first of its kind to associate a somatic HIF2alpha gain-of-function mutation with OZ-PGL. It is therefore recommended that patients without germline SDHx mutations should be tested for HIF2alpha mutations.

N2  - A central goal in cancer genomics is to identify the somatic alterations that underpin tumor initiation and progression. While commonly mutated cancer genes are readily identifiable, those that are rarely mutated across samples are difficult to distinguish from the large numbers of other infrequently mutated genes. We introduce a method, nCOP, that considers per-individual mutational profiles within the context of protein-protein interaction networks in order to identify small connected subnetworks of genes that, while not individually frequently mutated, comprise pathways that are altered across (i.e., "cover") a large fraction of individuals. By analyzing 6,038 samples across 24 different cancer types, we demonstrate that nCOP is highly effective in identifying cancer genes, including those with low mutation frequencies. Overall, our work demonstrates that combining per-individual mutational information with interaction networks is a powerful approach for tackling the mutational heterogeneity observed across cancers. Cancer-relevant genes, including those rarely mutated across samples, can be effectively identified by considering per-individual mutational profiles in the context of interaction networks and uncovering small connected subnetworks of genes, presumably participating in shared processes, that together are altered across (i.e., "cover") a large fraction of individuals.

N2  - Alterations of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), succinate dehydrogenase (SDHX), and TMEM127 have been associated with the development of pheochromocytomas (PCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) and are also associated with the development of renal neoplasms. This study involved 2 primary renal PGL and 12 cases of PC/PGL with associated renal neoplasia with a mean follow up of 74 months. Germline VHL and SDHX mutation status was obtained from the medical record. Immunohistochemistry for SDHB and mutation analysis for TMEM127 was performed, in addition to analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets for SDHX and TMEM127 mutated renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). The spectrum of renal neoplasia included clear cell and tubulocystic and papillary RCC, as well as a case of multiple papillary adenomas. Three patients had metastatic PC/PGL and three patients had VHL syndrome. Previously unreported TMEM127 alterations were identified in two patients, both without evidence of VHL syndrome or SDH-deficiency, and were classified as variants of uncertain significance. Primary renal PGL and neoplasia was associated with about 2% of 710 cases of PC/PGL. These were diagnosed concurrently or on average 27 months prior to the PC/PGL, and most were low-grade, low-stage clear cell RCCs. Up to half of patients with PC/PGL and renal neoplasia had VHL syndrome, SDH deficiency, or alterations in TMEM127. One (of three) case of metastatic PC/PGL had SDHB mutation and loss of SDHB by immunohistochemistry. The other two cases had retained SDHB expression.

N2  - The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has increased steadily in past few decades and is partially attributable to the increased utilization of cross-sectional imaging. Many of these carcinomas are small incidental discoveries, although a subset leads to locally advanced or distant disease. Although its molecular pathophysiology is not completely understood, knowledge of hereditary RCCs has shed light on some of the pathways involved. More recently, the rapid advances in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have allowed for a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the genetic aberrations that lead up to and result from the transformation of a renal tubular epithelial cell into a carcinoma. These discoveries have allowed for the development of novel therapeutics that target these pathways. They have also led to the development of diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers that could radically change the way RCC is diagnosed and treated. Although some of the current investigations are nascent and it remains to be seen which biomarkers will become clinically available, many candidate biomarkers show promise and require external validation. Ultimately, biomarkers may allow for cost-effective screening of high-risk patients, the identification of aggressive cancers among small renal masses, the identification of high-risk patients, the detection of recurrences postoperatively with minimal imaging, and the ability to choose appropriate targeted therapies for patients with metastatic disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - AIMS: Spindle cell proliferation within clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is usually considered as a sarcomatoid differentiation. Low-grade spindle cell proliferation (LG-SCP) in ccRCC was first described in 2001. This phenomenon is not common and can pose diagnostic challenges, particularly in core biopsies. The aim of this study was to describe morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of ccRCCs with LG-SCP.METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven cases of ccRCC with LG-SCP were retrieved from approximately 21 000 renal tumours in our registry. Ten cases of conventional ccRCC and 10 cases of typical sarcomatoid ccRCC were included as control groups. Morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were analysed. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene abnormalities were also analysed using molecular genetics. Among ccRCC with LG-SCP cases, there were five males and five females (clinical information was not available in one case) with a median age of 67 years (mean: 68.5, range: 60-81 years). Average tumour size was 7.1 cm (median:7.5, range:1.7-12 cm). Follow-up data were available in nine cases (mean: 44.78 months), with no aggressive behaviour seen. On average, LG-SCP areas constituted 5-80% of tumour volume (mean: 32.3%). Necrotic/regressed areas were seen in all cases ranging from 5% to 30%. LG-SCP was clearly epithelial, with no mitoses or any evidence of mesenchymal differentiation. Immunohistochemical profile of LG-SCP was consistent with 'conventional' ccRCC. Compared with sarcomatoid ccRCC, some EMT markers showed alteration in LG-SCP, including lower expression of N-cadherin and Zeb1 as well as higher expression of E-cadherin. However, there were no significant differences in EMT markers between LG-SCP and conventional ccRCC. Abnormalities in VHL (mutations, LOH3p) were found in six of 11 cases.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that LG-SCP in ccRCC have comparable immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics to those seen in 'conventional' ccRCC. Further, immunohistochemical analysis of EMT markers showed that LG-SCP did not differ from 'conventional' ccRCC. We believe that LG-SCP is a part of morphological heterogeneity in ccRCCs and that they may not represent an initial stage of sarcomatoid differentiation. This is supported further by the fact that ccRCC with LG-SCP did not display more aggressive behaviour than 'conventional' ccRCC.

N2  - Genomic studies have linked mTORC1 pathway-activating mutations with exceptional response to treatment with allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 called rapalogs. Rapalogs are approved for selected cancer types, including kidney and breast cancers. Here, we used sequencing data from 22 human kidney cancer cases to identify the activating mechanisms conferred by mTOR mutations observed in human cancers and advance precision therapeutics. mTOR mutations that clustered in focal adhesion kinase targeting domain (FAT) and kinase domains enhanced mTORC1 kinase activity, decreased nutrient reliance, and increased cell size. We identified 3 distinct mechanisms of hyperactivation, including reduced binding to DEP domain- containing MTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), resistance to regulatory associated protein of mTOR-mediated (RAPTORmediated) suppression, and altered kinase kinetics. Of the 28 mTOR double mutants, activating mutations could be divided into 6 complementation groups, resulting in synergistic Rag- and Ras homolog enriched in brain-independent (RHEBindependent) mTORC1 activation. mTOR mutants were resistant to DNA damage-inducible transcript 1-mediated (REDD1- mediated) inhibition, confirming that activating mutations can bypass the negative feedback pathway formed between HIF1 and mTORC1 in the absence of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor expression. Moreover, VHL-deficient cells that expressed activating mTOR mutants grew tumors that were sensitive to rapamycin treatment. These data may explain the high incidence of mTOR mutations observed in clear cell kidney cancer, where VHL loss and HIF activation is pathognomonic. Our study provides mechanistic and therapeutic insights concerning mTOR mutations in human diseases.

N2  - Pseudohypoxia plays a central role in the progression and therapeutic resistance of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. MicroRNA miR-126 has decreased expression in metastatic or relapsed ccRCC as compared to primary tumors, but the mechanisms by which miR-126 is implicated in RCC remain unknown. Through RNA-seq profiling to evaluate the impact of overexpression or CRISPR knockout of miR-126, we have identified SERPINE1 as a miR-126-5p target regulating cell motility, and SLC7A5 as a miR-126-3p target regulating the mTOR/HIF pathway. Specifically, miR-126 inhibits HIFalpha protein expression independent of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). On the other hand, deactivation of miR-126 induces a pseudohypoxia state due to increased HIFalpha expression, which further enhances therapeutic resistance and cell motility mediated by SLC7A5 and SERPINE1, respectively. Finally, the clinical relevance of miR-126 modulated gene regulation in ccRCC has been confirmed with profiling data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.

N2  - Primary clear cell microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity is rare. It has previously been described only as a VHL-associated tumour. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is an inherited cancer syndrome characterised by an elevated risk of neoplasia including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), haemangioblastoma, and phaeochromocytoma. We describe the second reported case of a primary clear cell microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity. The 39-year-old patient with VHL syndrome had previously undergone resection and ablation of ccRCC. He presented with epistaxis. Imaging demonstrated a mass in the ethmoid sinus. Initial clinical suspicion was of metastatic ccRCC. However, tumour morphology and immunoprofile were distinct from the previous ccRCC and supported a diagnosis of primary microcystic adenoma. Analysis of DNA extracted from sinonasal tumour tissue did not show loss of the wild-type allele at the VHL locus. Although this did not support tumour association with VHL disease, it was not possible to look for a loss-of-function mutation. The association of primary microcystic adenoma of the sinonasal cavity with VHL disease remains speculative. These lesions are benign but are likely to require regular surveillance. Such tumours may require repeated surgical excision.

N2  - Congenital secondary erythrocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased red blood cell production. An important cause involves defects in the oxygen sensing pathway, in particular the PHD2-VHL-HIF axis. Mutations in VHL are also associated with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor predisposition syndrome. The differences in phenotypic expression of VHL mutations are poorly understood. We report on three patients with erythrocytosis, from two unrelated families. All patients show exceptionally high erythropoietin (EPO) levels, and are homozygous for a novel missense mutation in VHL: c.162G>C p.(Met54Ile). The c.162G>C mutation is the most upstream homozygous VHL mutation described so far in patients with erythrocytosis. It abolishes the internal translational start codon, which directs expression of VHLp19, resulting in the production of only VHLp30. The exceptionally high EPO levels and the absence of VHL-associated tumors in the patients suggest that VHLp19 has a role for regulating EPO levels that VHLp30 does not have, whereas VHLp30 is really the tumor suppressor isoform.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is often inactivated in sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by mutation or promoter hypermethylation. The prognostic or predictive value of VHL gene alteration is not well established. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between the VHL alteration and clinical outcomes in patients with RCC. We searched PUBMED, MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles including following terms in their titles, abstracts, or keywords: 'kidney or renal', 'carcinoma or cancer or neoplasm or malignancy', 'von Hippel-Lindau or VHL', 'alteration or mutation or methylation', and 'prognostic or predictive'. There were six studies fulfilling inclusion criteria and a total of 633 patients with clear cell RCC were included in the study: 244 patients who received anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in the predictive value analysis and 419 in the prognostic value analysis. Out of 663 patients, 410 (61.8%) had VHL alteration. The meta-analysis showed no association between the VHL gene alteration and overall response rate (relative risk = 1.47 [95% CI, 0.81-2.67], P = 0.20) or progression free survival (hazard ratio = 1.02 [95% CI, 0.72-1.44], P = 0.91) in patients with RCC who received VEGF-targeted therapy. There was also no correlation between the VHL alteration and overall survival (HR = 0.80 [95% CI, 0.56-1.14], P = 0.21). In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that VHL gene alteration has no prognostic or predictive value in patients with clear cell RCC.

N2  - Inactivation of the VHL (Von Hippel Lindau) tumour suppressor has long been recognised as necessary for the pathogenesis of clear cell renal cancer (ccRCC); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying transformation and the requirement for additional genetic hits remain unclear. Here, we show that loss of VHL alone results in DNA replication stress and damage accumulation, effects that constrain cellular growth and transformation. By contrast, concomitant loss of the chromatin remodelling factor PBRM1 (mutated in 40% of ccRCC) rescues VHL-induced replication stress, maintaining cellular fitness and allowing proliferation. In line with these data we demonstrate that combined deletion of Vhl and Pbrm1 in the mouse kidney is sufficient for the development of fully-penetrant, multifocal carcinomas, closely mimicking human ccRCC. Our results illustrate how VHL and PBRM1 co-operate to drive renal transformation and uncover replication stress as an underlying vulnerability of all VHL mutated renal cancers that could be therapeutically exploited.

N2  - In our study, we demonstrate that ccRCC cell lines with impaired function of pVHL to degrade HIFalpha express elevated levels of PD-L1. In vitro analysis provided evidence that both reconstitution of pVHL and silencing of HIF2alpha, but not of HIF1alpha, lead to reduced PD-L1 expression. The strong correlation of expression between the HIF2alpha-specific HIF target Glut1 and PD-L1 confirmed this finding in ccRCC cell lines and tissue. Soluble PD-L1 levels remained constant in the sera of ccRCC patients regardless of the PD-L1 expression status in their tumors. In conclusion, our data suggest PD-L1 as HIF2alpha target, which is upregulated in pVHL deficient ccRCC. The combination of PD-L1 targeting drugs with HIF inhibiting agents may be an additional option for the treatment of ccRCC.

N2  - Activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt promotes the survival and proliferation of various cancers. Hypoxia promotes the resistance of tumor cells to specific therapies. We therefore explored a possible link between hypoxia and Akt activity. We found that Akt was prolyl-hydroxylated by the oxygen-dependent hydroxylase EglN1. The von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) bound directly to hydroxylated Akt and inhibited Akt activity. In cells lacking oxygen or functional pVHL, Akt was activated to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis. We also identified cancer-associated Akt mutations that impair Akt hydroxylation and subsequent recognition by pVHL, thus leading to Akt hyperactivation. Our results show that microenvironmental changes, such as hypoxia, can affect tumor behaviors by altering Akt activation, which has a critical role in tumor growth and therapeutic resistance.

N2  - Introduction: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and constitutes the most common heritable kidney disease. Most patients are affected by the autosomal dominant form (ADPKD) which generally is an adult-onset multisystem disorder. By contrast, the rarer recessive form ARPKD usually already manifests perinatally or in childhood. In some patients, however, ADPKD and ARPKD can phenotypically overlap with early manifestation in ADPKD and only late onset in ARPKD. Progressive fibrocystic renal changes are often accompanied by severe hepatobiliary changes or other extrarenal abnormalities. Areas covered: A reduced dosage of disease proteins disturbs cell homeostasis and explains a more severe clinical course in some PKD patients. Cystic kidney disease is also a common feature of other ciliopathies and genetic syndromes. Genetic diagnosis may guide clinical management and helps to avoid invasive measures and to detect renal and extrarenal comorbidities early in the clinical course. Expert Commentary: The broad phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of cystic and polycystic kidney diseases make NGS a particularly powerful approach. Interpretation of data becomes the challenge and bench and bedside benefit from digitized multidisciplinary interrelationships. Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate spectrum of patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) that required pars plana vitrectomy and evaluate anatomical and functional outcomes of surgery.METHODS: Twenty-three patients who underwent surgery for advanced VHL eye disease were assessed by genetic tests, diagnostic tests for systemic lesions, and clinical eye examination. The vitrectomized eyes were divided into two groups: with or without retinotomy (group R vs. NR). Functional and anatomical outcome was analyzed and compared between the groups.RESULTS: All patients had central nervous system hemangioblastomas and 57% had other systemic tumors. Point germline mutations, large partial deletions, and complete vhl gene deletions were found in 64%, 27%, and 9% of patients, accordingly. Destruction of hemangioblastomas by retinotomy, laser, or cryotherapy and anatomical attachment of the retina were achieved in all eyes. Preoperative mean distance best-corrected visual acuity was logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 2.66 (20/9,140) in group R and 1.76 (20/1,150) in group NR (P < 0.05). At 6 months postoperatively, distance best-corrected visual acuity improved in 20 eyes (83%). After over 24 months postoperatively, distance best-corrected visual acuity remained better than preoperatively in 36% in the R group and in 70% in the NR group of eyes. During 24 months postoperatively in 17 eyes, new retinal capillary hemangiomas developed. The mean number of new retinal capillary hemangiomas per eye was higher in group R than in group NR (3.14 vs. 0.70; P < 0.01). In group R, number of new retinal capillary hemangioblastoma was higher in retinal segments where retinotomy was performed (n = 29) than in other areas (n = 13) (P < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Advanced VHL eye disease correlates with occurrence of central nervous system and systemic lesions. Spectrum of vhl gene mutation in the patients corresponds to that of the general VHL population. Pars plana vitrectomy in advanced VHL eye disease can improve or preserve visual function, but postoperative progression of ocular VHL disease can be accelerated in cases where retinotomy is performed.

N2  - Hemangioblastomas are rare and benign tumors accounting for less than 2% of all central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The vast majority of hemangioblastomas occur sporadically, whereas a small number of cases, especially in younger patients, are associated with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. It is thought that loss of tumor suppressor function of the VHL gene results in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha with downstream activation of cellular proliferative and angiogenic genes that promote tumorigenesis. VHL-related hemangioblastomas predominantly occur in the cerebellum and spine. Lesions are often diagnosed on contrast-enhanced craniospinal MRIs, and the diagnosis of VHL occurs through assessment for germline VHL mutations. Surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality for symptomatic or worrisome lesions, with excellent local control rates and neurological outcomes. Stereotactic radiotherapy can be employed in patients who are deemed high risk for surgery, have multiple lesions, or have non-resectable lesions. Given the tendency for development of either new or multiple lesions, close radiographic surveillance is often recommended for asymptomatic lesions.
