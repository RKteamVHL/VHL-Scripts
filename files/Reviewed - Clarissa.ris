N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in the vast majority of human clear cell renal carcinomas. The pathogenesis of VHL loss is currently best understood to occur through stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factors, activation of hypoxia-induced signaling pathways, and transcriptional reprogramming towards a pro-angiogenic and pro-growth state. However, hypoxia also drives other pro-tumorigenic processes, including the development of genomic instability via down-regulation of DNA repair gene expression. Here, we find that DNA repair genes involved in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR) and in mismatch repair, which are down-regulated by hypoxic stress, are decreased in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells relative to wild type VHL-complemented cells. Functionally, this gene repression is associated with impaired DNA double-strand break repair in VHL-deficient cells, as determined by the persistence of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and reduced repair activity in a homology-dependent plasmid reactivation assay. Furthermore, VHL deficiency conferred increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, analogous to the synthetic lethality observed between hypoxia and these agents. Finally, we discovered a correlation between VHL inactivation and reduced HR gene expression in a large panel of human renal carcinoma samples. Together, our data elucidate a novel connection between VHL-deficient renal carcinoma and hypoxia-induced down-regulation of DNA repair, and identify potential opportunities for targeting DNA repair defects in human renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - The skeleton has emerged as an important regulator of systemic glucose homeostasis, with osteocalcin and insulin representing prime mediators of the interplay between bone and energy metabolism. However, genetic evidence indicates that osteoblasts can influence global energy metabolism through additional, as yet unknown, mechanisms. Here, we report that constitutive or postnatally induced deletion of the hypoxia signaling pathway component von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) in skeletal osteolineage cells of mice led to high bone mass as well as hypoglycemia and increased glucose tolerance, not accounted for by osteocalcin or insulin. In vitro and in vivo data indicated that Vhl-deficient osteoblasts displayed massively increased glucose uptake and glycolysis associated with upregulated HIF-target gene expression, resembling the Warburg effect that typifies cancer cells. Overall, the glucose consumption by the skeleton was increased in the mutant mice, as revealed by 18F-FDG radioactive tracer experiments. Moreover, the glycemia levels correlated inversely with the level of skeletal glucose uptake, and pharmacological treatment with the glycolysis inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA), which restored glucose metabolism in Vhl-deficient osteogenic cells in vitro, prevented the development of the systemic metabolic phenotype in the mutant mice. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel link between cellular glucose metabolism in osteoblasts and whole-body glucose homeostasis, controlled by local hypoxia signaling in the skeleton.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an important tumor suppressor that is lost in the majority of clear cell carcinoma of renal cancer (ccRCC). Its regulatory pathway involves the activity of E3 ligase, which targets hypoxia inducible factor alpha (including HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha) for proteasome degradation. In recent years, emerging literature suggests that VHL also possesses other HIF-independent functions. This review will focus on VHL-mediated signaling pathways involving the latest identified substrates/binding partners, including N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (NDRG3), AKT, and G9a, etc., and their physiological roles in hypoxia signaling and cancer. We will also discuss the crosstalk between VHL and NF-kappaB signaling. Lastly, we will review the latest findings on targeting VHL signaling in cancer.

N2  - Recent studies have reported that chemically synthesized double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), also known as small activating RNA (saRNAs), can specifically induce gene expression by targeting promoter sequences by a mechanism termed RNA activation (RNAa). In the present study, we designed 4 candidate saRNAs targeting the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene promoter. Among these saRNAs, dsVHL-821 significantly inhibited cell growth by up-regulating VHL at both the mRNA and protein levels in renal cell carcinoma 769-P cells. Functional analysis showed that dsVHL-821 induced apoptosis by increasing p53, decreasing Bcl-xL, activating caspase 3/7 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that dsVHL-821 increased the enrichment of Ago2 and RNA polymerase II at the dsVHL-821 target site. In addition, Ago2 depletion significantly suppressed dsVHL-821-induced up-regulation of VHL gene expression and related effects. Single transfection of dsVHL-821 caused long-lasting (14 days) VHL up-regulation. Furthermore, the activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 was accompanied by an increase in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of histone 4 (H4ac) and a decrease in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2) in the dsVHL-821 target region. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dsVHL-821, a novel saRNA for VHL, induces the expression of the VHL gene by epigenetic changes, leading to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and suggest that targeted activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 may be explored as a novel treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bispecific molecules containing a target protein binder and an ubiquitin ligase binder connected by a linker. By recruiting an ubiquitin ligase to a target protein, PROTACs promote ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the target protein. The generation of effective PROTACs depends on the nature of the protein/ligase ligand pair, linkage site, linker length, and linker composition, all of which have been difficult to address in a systematic way. Herein, we describe a "click chemistry" approach for the synthesis of PROTACs. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with the bromodomain and extraterminal domain-4 (BRD4) ligand JQ-1 (3) and ligase binders targeting cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) proteins. An AlphaScreen proximity assay was used to determine the ability of PROTACs to form the ternary ligase-PROTAC-target protein complex and a MSD assay to measure cellular degradation of the target protein promoted by PROTACs.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations induce neural tissue hemangioblastomas, as well as highly vascularized clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Pathological vessel remodeling arises from misregulation of HIFs and VEGF, among other genes. Variation in disease penetrance has long been recognized in relation to genotype. We show Vhl mutations also disrupt Notch signaling, causing mutation-specific vascular abnormalities, e.g., type 1 (null) vs. type 2B (murine G518A representing human R167Q). In conditional mutation retina vasculature, Vhl-null mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/fl) had little effect on initial vessel branching, but it severely reduced arterial and venous branching at later stages. Interestingly, this mutation accelerated arterial maturation, as observed in retina vessel morphology and aberrant alpha-smooth muscle actin localization, particularly in vascular pericytes. RNA sequencing analysis identified gene expression changes within several key pathways, including Notch and smooth muscle cell contractility. Notch inhibition failed to reverse later-stage branching defects but rescued the accelerated arterialization. Retinal vessels harboring the type 2B Vhl mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/2B) displayed stage-specific changes in vessel branching and an advanced progression toward an arterial phenotype. Disrupting Notch signaling in type 2B mutants increased both artery and vein branching and restored arterial maturation toward nonmutant levels. By revealing differential effects of the null and type 2B Vhl mutations on vessel branching and maturation, these data may provide insight into the variability of VHL-associated vascular changes - particularly the heterogeneity and aggressiveness in ccRCC vessel growth - and also suggest Notch pathway targets for treating VHL syndrome.

N2  - Ankyrin repeat (ANK) domains are one of the most abundant motifs in eukaryotic proteins. ANK proteins are rare amongst viruses with the exception of poxviruses, which presumably acquired them from the host via horizontal gene transfer. The architecture of poxvirus ANK proteins is however different from their cellular counterparts and this precludes a direct acquisition event. Here we combine bioinformatics analysis and quantitative proteomics to discovera new class of viral ANK proteins with a domain organisation that relates to cellular ANK proteins. These non-canonical viral ANK proteins,termed ANK/BC, interact with host Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BCbox resembling that of cellular Cullin-2 substrate adaptors such as the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Mutagenesis of the BC box-like sequence abrogatesbinding to Cullin-2, whereas fusion of this motif to an ANK-only protein confersCullin-2 association. We demonstrate that these viral ANK/BC proteins are potent immunomodulatory proteins suppressing the activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF-3 and the production of cytokines and chemokines including interferon, and that association with Cullin-2 is required for optimal inhibitory activity. ANK/BC proteins exist in several orthopoxvirusesand cluster into 2 closely relatedorthologue groups in a phylogenetic lineage that is separate from canonical ANK/F-box proteins. Given the existence of cellular proteins with similar architecture,viral ANK/BC proteins may be closely related to the original ANK gene acquired by an ancestral orthopoxvirus.These findingsuncover a novel viral strategy to antagonise innate immunity and shed light on the origin of the poxviral ANK protein family.<b>IMPORTANCE</b>Viruses encode multiple proteins aimed at modulating cellular homeostasis and antagonising the host anti-viral response. Most of these genes were originally acquired from the host and subsequently adapted to the virus advantage. ANK proteins are common in eukaryotes, but unusual amongst viruses with the exception of poxviruses where they represent one of the largest protein families. We discover here the existence of a new class of viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, that provide new insights on the origin of poxvirus ANK proteins. ANK/BC proteins target the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box domain and are potent suppressors of the production of inflammatory cytokines including interferon. The existence of cellular ANK proteins with similar architecture suggests the acquisition of a host ANK/BC gene by an ancestral orthopoxvirus and its subsequent duplication and adaptation to widen the repertoire of immune evasion strategies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by a spectrum of hypervascular tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma, which occur with VHL genotype-specific differences in penetrance. VHL loss causes a failure to regulate the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), resulting in accumulation of both factors to high levels. Although HIF dysregulation is critical to VHL disease-associated renal tumorigenesis, increasing evidence points toward gradations of HIF dysregulation contributing to the degree of predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and other manifestations of the disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This investigation examined the ability of disease-specific VHL missense mutations to support the assembly of the VBC complex and to promote the ubiquitylation of HIF. Our interaction analysis supported previous observations that VHL Type 2B mutations disrupt the interaction between pVHL and Elongin C but maintain partial regulation of HIF. We additionally demonstrated that Type 2B mutant pVHL forms a remnant VBC complex containing the active members ROC1 and Cullin-2 which retains the ability to ubiquitylate HIF-1alpha. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that subtypes of VHL mutations support an intermediate level of HIF regulation via a remnant VBC complex. These findings provide a mechanism for the graded HIF dysregulation and genetic predisposition for cancer development in VHL disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The two-stage mutation model involving successive inactivation of both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene was originally proposed by Knudson, who analyzed the age incidence curves for unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma, and suggested that hereditary tumors arise by a single somatic event superimposed on a defective genetic background and sporadic tumors by a two-stage somatic process. In this study, the age-incidence curve of patients with retinal hemangioblastoma with and without associated von Hippel-Lindau disease were analyzed. METHODS: We reviewed the literature between 1964 and 1998 to find all reported cases of retinal hemangioblastoma and classified patients in a type A group (n = 223) when associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease and a type B group (n = 30) when not associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. We analyzed and compared the age incidence of these two groups. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the mean age at diagnosis of retinal hemangioblastoma in the two groups, i.e., 48.4 +/- 16.6 years for type B patients and 24.9 +/- 12.0 years for type A patients (p < 0.0001). The age incidence curve for type A retinal hemangioblastoma fit a first-order equation (log S = 0.411-0.034t) with r = 0.97, indicating a single somatic mutation, whereas the age incidence curve for type B retinal hemangioblastoma fit a second-order equation (log S = 0.184-2.25 x 10(-4)t2) with r = 0.97, indicating two somatic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Type B (sporadic) retinal hemangioblastoma may arise from two separate somatic mutations inactivating both alleles at the von Hippel-Lindau locus, whereas patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (type A) inherit a defective allele and require only one additional somatic mutation.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome characterised by the development of retinal, cerebellar, and spinal haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and phaeochromocytoma. The gene for VHL disease has been mapped to chromosome 3p25-p26 and flanking markers identified. We have investigated the usefulness of currently available DNA markers for the presymptomatic diagnosis of VHL disease. In the first part of this investigation, genetic linkage data from two previously published studies were updated and reanalysed to provide accurate estimates of sex specific recombination fractions and to confirm that there is no evidence of locus heterogeneity. In the second part of this study, 14 families containing 23 asymptomatic subjects at 50% prior risk of VHL disease were investigated with closely linked DNA markers (RAF1, D3S18, D3S732). Seventeen subjects were informative with one or more markers, six of whom were informative at markers flanking the VHL disease gene. By combining age related and DNA based risk information the carrier risk for 11 subjects was reduced to < 2%.

N2  - Clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and intracellular lipid accumulation by unknown pathomechanisms. The immunochemical analysis of 356 RCCs revealed high abundance of apoA-I and apoB, as well as scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) in the ccRCC subtype. Given the characteristic loss of VHL function in ccRCC, we used VHL-defective and VHL-proficient cells to study the potential influence of VHL on lipoprotein uptake. VHL-defective patient-derived ccRCC cells and cell lines (786O and RCC4) showed enhanced uptake as well as less resecretion and degradation of radio-iodinated HDL and LDL (<sup>125</sup>I-HDL and <sup>125</sup>I-LDL, respectively) compared with the VHL-proficient cells. The ccRCC cells showed enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and SR-BI expression compared with normal kidney epithelial cells. Uptake of <sup>125</sup>I-HDL and <sup>125</sup>I-LDL by patient-derived normal kidney epithelial cells as well as the VHL-reexpressing ccRCC cell lines, 786-O-VHL and RCC4-O-VHL cells, was strongly enhanced by VEGF treatment. The knockdown of the VEGF coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP1), as well as blocking of SR-BI significantly reduced the uptake of lipoproteins into ccRCC cells in vitro. LDL stimulated proliferation of 786-O cells more potently than 786-O-VHL cells in a NRP1- and SR-BI-dependent manner. In conclusion, enhanced lipoprotein uptake due to increased activities of VEGF/NRP1 and SR-BI promotes lipid accumulation and proliferation of VHL-defective ccRCC cells.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor susceptibility disease characterized by the development of hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord and retina; pheochromocytomas and renal cell carcinoma. The disease is caused by mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p26-p25. In this paper, we present two patients with VHL disease type 2B confirmed by genetic analysis. Diagnosis in the first patient was based on demonstration of retinal hemangioblastoma in association with bilateral pheochromocytoma. Family screening revealed renal cell carcinoma in her father and uncle. The second patient was discovered during family screening of another index case in adult age. VHL disease should be clinically suspected in any individual with a pheochromocytoma especially when there is bilateral and/or multifocal disease or family history. Screening of patients and at-risk family members for VHL-associated tumors should be essential in management of VHL.

N2  - Molecular genetic studies of familial cancer syndromes identified and defined the recessive nature of tumor suppressor genes and resolved the paradox of why tumors arising in such families exhibited an autosomally dominant pattern of inheritance. Subsequent characterization of tumor suppressor proteins revealed their widespread involvement in sporadic cancers and pinpointed key mechanisms that protect animals against tumor development. We now recognize that tumor suppressor genes regulate diverse cellular activities, including cell cycle checkpoint responses, detection and repair of DNA damage, protein ubiquitination and degradation, mitogenic signaling, cell specification, differentiation and migration, and tumor angiogenesis. Their study has become a centerpiece of contemporary cancer research.

N2  - Hypoxia is an important contributor to aggressive behavior and resistance mechanisms in glioblastoma. Upregulation of hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs) is the primary adaptive cellular response to a hypoxic environment. While HIF1alpha has been widely studied in cancer, HIF2alpha offers a potentially more specific and appealing target in glioblastoma given expression in glioma stem cells and not normal neural progenitors, activation in states of chronic hypoxia and expression that correlates with glioma patient survival. A first-in-class HIF2alpha inhibitor, PT2385, is in clinical trials for renal cell carcinoma, and provides the first opportunity to therapeutically target this important pathway in glioma biology.

N2  - The product of a proto-oncogene, the c-Met protein is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Its only known ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, regulates cell growth, motility, migration, invasion, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Dysregulation of c-Met and hepatocyte growth factor have been observed in both clear cell and non-clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), although only papillary RCCs harbor activating mutations in the MET gene. In clear cell RCC, there is evidence of a direct link between loss of von Hippel-Lindau and up-regulation of c-Met. As in other cancers, high expression of c-Met correlates with worse outcomes in RCC. In vitro and in vivo preclinical RCC models demonstrate cancer control with small molecule and antibodies against c-Met. Given these findings, the c-Met pathway is a logical therapeutic target in RCC, and several agents are in clinical testing with early signs of efficacy.

N2  - Hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumors (HOCT) of the kidney have been described in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) and in association with renal oncocytosis without BHD. HOCT in patients without evidence of BHD or renal oncocytosis is exceedingly rare, and these cases have been poorly characterized. We have identified and studied 14 cases of HOCT from previously diagnosed renal oncocytomas (398 cases) and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (351 cases) without evidence of BHD or renal oncocytosis. Immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular genetic studies analyzing numerical chromosomal changes, loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 3p, and mutation status of VHL, c-kit, PDGFR, and folliculin (FLCN) genes were performed. HOCTs were identified in nine men and five women (age range 40-79 years). The size of tumors ranged from 2 to 11 cm. All tumors displayed a solid alveolar architecture and were composed of cells with abundant granular eosinophilic oncocytic cytoplasm with perinuclear halos. Occasional binucleated neoplastic cells were present, but irregular, hyperchromatic, wrinkled (raisinoid) nuclei were absent. The cytoplasm contained numerous mitochondria of varying sizes, but only sparse microvesicles with amorphic lamellar content were found. Tumors were positive for CK7 (12/14), AE1-AE3 (14/14), anti-mitochondrial antigen (14/14), E-cadherin (11/13), parvalbumin (12/14), and epithelial membrane antigen (14/14). Tumors were generally negative for racemase, CK20, CD10, and carboanhydrase IX. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed multiple chromosomal losses and gains with a median of four (range 1-9) chromosomal aberrations per case. Monosomy of chromosome 20 was common and found in 7 of 14 cases. Monosomy of chromosomes 6 and 9 was present in 4 of 14 cases each, of which two cases displayed monosomy for both chromosomes 6 and 9. Polysomy of chromosomes 10, 21, and 22 was found in 4/14 cases each, of which one case displayed polysomy for all these three chromosomes. No pathogenic mutations were found in the VHL, c-kit, PDGFR, and folliculin (FLCN) genes. (1) We have shown that hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumors of the kidney do occur, albeit rarely, outside the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and without associated renal oncocytosis. (2) These tumors constitute a relatively homogenous group with histomorphologic features of both chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. (3) Sporadic hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe renal tumors are characterized by multiple numerical aberrations (both mono- and polysomies) of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 21, and 22 and lack of mutations in the VHL, c-kit, PDGFRA, and FLCN genes. (4) The tumors seem to behave indolently as no evidence of malignant behavior was documented in our series, although admittedly, the follow-up was too short to fully elucidate the biological nature of this rare neoplasm. At worst, these tumors could have a low malignant potential, which only can be found out with longer follow-up.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The article reviews the evolution of targeted therapies for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and recent developments in the field. The vast majority of work in kidney cancer deals with clear cell RCC, which is the most common variant of this malignancy. The identification of loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau protein as the basis for clear cell RCC, in addition to the well designed clinical trials that have ensued, provide an outstanding model for the development of mechanism-based targeted therapy in cancer. RECENT FINDINGS: The treatment of advanced and metastatic RCC continues to be a major challenge for uro-oncologists despite the approval of six targeted therapies over the past 5 years. This rapid growth in therapeutic options has brought much needed improvements in overall and progression-free survival, although durable complete responses are rare. However, the plurality of treatments also poses challenges in terms of selecting the best therapy for a given patient, designing trials with appropriate comparison arms and endpoints, identifying well tolerated and effective drug combinations or sequences, and determining the role of targeted therapies in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. SUMMARY: Vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin-targeted therapies continue to play a critical role in the management of advanced and metastatic RCC. Ongoing research to identify novel agents continues to build upon the work done during the elucidation of the von Hippel-Lindau/clear cell RCC pathway. It is hoped that ongoing and planned studies will enable development of therapeutic regimens that will incorporate agents with improved toxicity and better efficacy as well as defining a role for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of advanced RCC.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) disease is an inherited disorder characterized by numerous cystic and solid neoplasms. Because of the recent identification of the vHL gene, other investigators have demonstrated genetic mutations in this gene in several of the neoplasms associated with the disease. We describe a patient with an endolymphatic sac (ELS) tumor and vHL disease. The purpose of this study was to identify a similar genetic mutation within the vHL gene of the ELS tumor. METHODS: Using the patient's archival pathological slides, neoplastic cells were microdissected to yield a purely neoplastic cell population. The deoxyribonucleic acid of these cells was then extracted and amplified via polymerase chain reaction. After sufficient amplification, the specimen was analyzed on a single-strand conformation polymorphism gel system to detect putative changes in the base sequence. RESULTS: Single-strand conformation polymorphism gel system analysis yielded two bands representing the two single strands of deoxyribonucleic acid that were amplified. The upper band of the specimen was shifted down (compared with controls), representing a conformational change as a result of genetic mutation. CONCLUSION: ELS tumors are uncommon, and, to our knowledge, only seven cases associated with vHL disease have been reported in the literature. Although this association has been previously mentioned, no definitive studies have linked the two together. We report the eighth case of ELS tumor and vHL disease. We have demonstrated through molecular biological techniques, that, in our patient's tumor, a genetic mutation occurred, and that this mutation is similar to mutations previously reported in other neoplasms associated with vHL. We therefore suggest that ELS tumors be considered among the neoplasms associated with vHL. [References: 29]

N2  - Biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is a common event in hereditary (von Hippel- Lindau disease) and sporadic hemangioblastomas and clear-cell renal carcinomas. Germ-line VHL mutations are also linked to some hereditary pheochromocytoma families. The VHL gene product, pVHL, interacts with a number of cellular proteins and is implicated in the control of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation, cell metabolism, and mitogenesis. The best understood function of pVHL relates to its role as the substrate recognition unit of an E3 ligase that targets the heterodimeric transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) for destruction in the presence of oxygen. Down-regulation of HIF appears to be both necessary and sufficient for renal tumor suppression by pVHL, and HIF is strongly suspected of contributing to hemangioblastoma development as well. Recent work suggests that pVHL's role in pheochromocytoma is not related to HIF but rather to the ability of pVHL to regulate neuronal apoptosis, which is mediated by c-Jun, when growth factors such as NGF become limiting. Loss of pVHL leads to up-regulation of JunB, which antagonizes c-Jun and blunts apoptosis. Copyright © 2005 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

N2  - Germline mutations of FH, the gene that encodes for the tricarboxylic acid TCA (TCA) cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase, are associated with an inherited form of cancer referred to as Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC). Individuals with HLRCC are predisposed to the development of highly malignant and lethal renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The mechanisms of tumorigenesis proposed have largely focused on the biochemical consequences of loss of FH enzymatic activity. While loss of the tumor suppressor gene von Hippel Lindau (VHL) is thought to be an initiating event for the majority of RCCs, a role for FH in sporadic renal cancer has not been explored. Here we report that FH mRNA and protein expression are reduced in clear cell renal cancer, the most common histologic variant of kidney cancer. Moreover, we demonstrate that reduced FH leads to the accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor- 2alpha (HIF-2alpha), a transcription factor known to promote renal carcinogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of FH in renal cancer cells inhibits cellular migration and invasion. These data provide novel insights into the tumor suppressor functions of FH in sporadic kidney cancer.

N2  - Mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (vhl) causes the von Hippel-Lindau cancer syndrome as well as sporadic renal clear cell carcinoma. To pursue our study of the intracellular localization of VHL protein in relation to its function, we fused VHL to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to produce the VHL-GFP fusion protein. Like VHL, VHL-GFP binds to elongins B and C and Cullin-2 and regulates target gene product levels, including levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and glucose transporter 1. VHL-GFP localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm, with some detectable nuclear signal. Inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) causes VHL to be redistributed to the nucleus. A cellular fusion assay was used to demonstrate that inhibition of transcription induces a decrease in the nuclear export rate of VHL. The dependence of transcription for trafficking is lost with a deletion of exon 2, a region with a mutation causing a splice defect in the VHL gene in sporadic renal clear cell carcinoma. Addition of a strong nuclear export signal (NES) derived from the Rev protein results in complete nuclear exclusion and abrogates the redistribution of VHL-GFP-NES into the nucleus upon inhibition of transcription. Leptomycin B, which inhibits NES-mediated nuclear export, reverts the distribution of VHL-GFP-NES to that of VHL-GFP and restores sensitivity to actinomycin D and DRB. Uncoupling of VHL-GFP trafficking to transcription either by an exon 2 deletion or fusion to NES abolishes VHL function. We suggest that VHL function requires not only nuclear or cytoplasmic localization, but also exon 2-mediated transcription- dependent trafficking between these two cellular compartments.

N2  - We report the clinical, pathologic, and genetic features of renal malignancy in two children with diffuse cystic hyperplasia. Both presented with massive bilateral nephromegaly. Neither had a family history or clinical findings suggestive of tuberous sclerosis or von Hippel-Lindau disease. The kidneys of both children were extensively replaced by tubulocystic hyperplasia with large eosinophilic epithelial cells. The masses of hyperplastic tissue were nodular, compressing remnants of uninvolved renal parenchyma. Tubulopapillary carcinoma was present in both children, one of whom had bilateral multicentric carcinoma. No loss of heterozygosity was detected in the tumors at the TSC1, TSC2, or VHL gene regions, and no alterations in the VHL gene were detected using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. These cases of bilateral renal enlargement with diffuse cystic hyperplasia appear to represent a new clinical syndrome that may warrant bilateral nephrectomy because of the risk of malignancy.

N2  - Disruption of the daily (i.e., circadian) rhythms of cell metabolism, proliferation and blood perfusion is a hallmark of many cancer types, perhaps most clearly exemplified by the rare but detrimental pheochromocytomas. These tumors arise from genetic disruption of genes critical for hypoxia signaling, such as von Hippel-Lindau and hypoxia-inducible factor-2 or cellular metabolism, such as succinate dehydrogenase, which in turn impacts on the cellular circadian clock function by interfering with the Bmal1 and/or Clock transcription factors. While pheochromocytomas are often non-malignant, the resulting changes in cellular physiology are coupled to de-regulated production of catecholamines, which in turn disrupt circadian blood pressure variation and therefore circadian entrainment of other tissues. In this review we thoroughly discuss the molecular and physiological interplay between hypoxia signaling and the circadian clock in pheochromocytoma, and how this underlies endocrine disruption leading to loss of circadian blood pressure variation in the affected patients. We furthermore discuss potential avenues for targeting these tumor-specific pathophysiological mechanisms therapeutically in the future.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome predisposing carriers to the development of a panel of highly vascularized tumors such as central nervous system and retinal hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, clear-cell renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The disease is the foremost cause of inherited renal cell carcinomas, which is induced by germline mutations of the VHL tumor-suppressor gene also inactivated in most sporadic renal cell carcinomas. VHL appears to be a pivotal gene in the oxygen-sensing pathway, mainly involved in targeting the hypoxia-inducible factors for ubiquitination. This discovery is opening the way for the development of new specific drugs inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factors and/or their downstream targets, possibly representing an attractive treatment not only for von Hippel-Lindau disease but also for sporadic renal cell carcinomas and others cancers.

N2  - Renal cell carcinomas in children and young adults are rare, and the pathologic features of these tumors have not been well described. We reviewed 24 renal cell carcinomas in children and young adults ages 6 to 29 years, 14 of whom were younger than 18 years of age. Fourteen were female. In 19 (79%) of 24 cases, the tumor met histologic criteria for papillary renal cell carcinoma, with at least 50% papillary architecture. Four of the remaining five cases were typical clear cell tumors in patients known to have von Hippel Lindau syndrome, and one case was of chromophobe type. In the papillary tumors, calcifications, high nuclear grade, extracapsular extension (American Joint Commission on Cancer stage T3), and lymph node metastases were common. Among these papillary tumors, four distinct histologic patterns could be identified. Collecting duct-like tumors (two cases) involved the large collecting ducts, were multifocal and predominantly papillary, and had focal tubular and solid areas. These tumors were reactive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and keratins, including CK7, but negative for Ulex europeaus and high molecular weight keratin 34BE12. Voluminous cell tumors (four cases) were composed of cells with extremely voluminous clear cytoplasm and, although predominantly papillary, had areas that also resembled clear cell tumors. These tumors were reactive for keratins AE1/AE3 but were otherwise negative for all other keratins, EMA, and U. europeaus. One of these tumors showed an X;7 translocation. Adult type tumors (12 cases) resembled papillary tumors of adults. These tumors were reactive for EMA and keratins, including CK7, and all but one were negative for U. europeaus and keratin 34BE12. This last case had trisomies of chromosomes 7, 16, 17, and 20. The final neuroendocrinelike case was multifocal, organoid, and composed of nests of small cells in a neuroendocrinelike pattern. Three of 13 patients were alive with disease at last follow-up, and three additional patients died of disease, all within 2 years. Progression was highly associated with lymph node involvement at the time of resection. We conclude that the clinicopathologic features of renal cell carcinomas in children and young adults differ from those arising in older adults. These tumors are characteristically high-grade, high-stage, papillary tumors with numerous calcifications, and several subtypes can be identified based on histologic, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic features. Some subtypes appear to be unique to this age group.

Furthermore, concurrent tumors arising in the same spinal level with discrete histopathology are much rarer. We report two such cases. Case 1: A 53-year-old man presented with intracranial hemorrhage that manifested as disturbed consciousness and right hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography demonstrated severe stenosis of the terminal portion of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, implying Moyamoya disease. Cranial MR images showed a hematoma in the left basal ganglia perforating into the lateral ventricle, which was incidentally detected as a spinal tumor compressing the cervical cord at the C2 level. After conservative management for cerebral hemorrhage, the patient underwent total removal of the spinal tumor. Surgical findings showed that the tumor consisted of extra- and intradural components. Histopathological findings showed that the extra- and intradural components were schwannoma and meningioma, respectively. Case 2: A 70-year-old man presented with progressive left hemiparesis and numbness in both lower extremities. Craniocervical MR images demonstrated a paraspinal tumor compressing the spinal cord at C2 level. Surgical findings disclosed that the tumor consisted of major extradural- and minor intradural components. Histopathological study showed that these components had discrete histological findings: extradural lesion was schwannoma and intradural lesion was meningioma. Concurrent tumors with discrete histopathology should be considered in tumors with extra- and intradural components, particularly, when they are located in the high cervical spine.

N2  - PURPOSE: Genetic factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with around 3% of cases having a family history. A greater knowledge of the genetics of inherited RCC has the potential to translate into novel therapeutic targets for sporadic RCC.METHODS: A literature review was performed summarising the current knowledge on hereditary RCC diagnosis, surveillance and management.RESULTS: Familial RCC is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although inherited RCC may present without a relevant family history. A number of familial RCC syndromes have been identified. Familial non-syndromic RCC is suspected when >=2 relatives are affected in the absence of syndromic features, although clear diagnostic criteria are lacking. Young age at onset and bilateral/multicentric tumours are recognised characteristics which should prompt molecular genetic analysis. Surveillance in individuals at risk of inherited RCC aims to prevent morbidity and mortality via early detection of tumours. Though screening and management guidelines for some inherited RCC syndromes (e.g. von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis) are well defined for rare cause of inherited RCC (e.g. germline BAP1 mutations), there is limited information regarding the lifetime RCC risks and the most appropriate screening modalities.CONCLUSION: Increasing knowledge of the natural history and genetic basis has led to characterisation and tailored management of hereditary RCC syndromes. International data sharing of inherited RCC gene variant information may enable evidence-based improvements in the diagnosis, surveillance protocols and management of these rare conditions.

N2  - The VHL gene product (pVHL) forms a multimeric complex with the elongin B and C, Cul2 and Rbx1 proteins (VCBCR complex), which is homologous to the SCF family of ubiquitin ligase complexes. The VCBCR complex binds HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, transcription factors critically involved in cellular responses to hypoxia, and targets them for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Germline mutations in the VHL gene cause susceptibility to haemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), phaeochromocytoma and other tumours. In addition somatic inactivation of the VHL gene occurs in most sporadic clear cell RCC (CC-RCC). However, the absence of somatic VHL inactivation in 30-40% of CC-RCC implies the involvement of other gatekeeper genes in CC-RCC development. We reasoned that in CC-RCC without VHL inactivation, other pVHL-interacting proteins might be defective. To assess the role of elongin B/C, Rbx1 and HIF-1alpha in RCC tumorigenesis we (a) mapped the genes to chromosomes 8q(cen) (elongin C), 16p13.3 (elongin B) and 22q11.2 (Rbx1) by FISH, monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel screening and in silico GenBank homology searching; (b) determined the genomic organisation of elongin C (by direct sequencing of PAC clones), Rbx1 and elongin B (by GenBank homology searching); and (c) performed mutation analysis of exons comprising the coding regions of elongins B, C and Rbx1 and the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1alpha by SSCP screening and direct sequencing in 35 sporadic clear cell RCC samples without VHL gene inactivation and in 13 individuals with familial non-VHL clear cell RCC. No coding region sequence variations were detected for the elongin B, elongin C or Rbx1 genes. Two amino acid substitutions (Pro582Ser and Ala588Thr) were identified in the oxygen-dependent degradation/pVHL binding domain of HIF-1alpha, however neither substitution was observed exclusively in tumour samples. Association analysis in panels of CC-RCC and non-neoplastic samples using the RFLPs generated by each variant did not reveal allelic frequency differences between RCC patients and controls (P>0.32 by chi-squared analysis). Nevertheless, the significance of these variations and their potential for modulation of HIF-1alpha function merits further investigation in both other tumour types and in non-neoplastic disease. Taken together with our previous Cul2 mutation analysis these data suggest that development of sporadic and familial RCC is not commonly contributed to by genetic events altering the destruction domain of HIF-1alpha, or components of the HIF-alpha destruction complex other than VHL itself. Although (a) activation of HIF could occur through mutation of another region of HIF-a, and (b) epigenetic silencing of elongin B/C, Cul2 or Rbx1 cannot be excluded, these findings suggest that pVHL may represent the sole mutational target through which the VCBR complex is disrupted in CC-RCC. HIF response is activated in CC-RCC tumorigenesis.

N2  - Objective: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and is characterized by biallelic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. One effect of VHL inactivation is hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha)-independent constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Both NF-kappaB and JNK drive ccRCC growth and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The purpose of this study was to determine the biochemical effects of pomegranate juice extracts (PE) on RCC cell lines. Methods: The pre-clinical effects of PE on NF-kappaB, JNK, and the EMT phenotype were assayed, including its effect on proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and invasion of pVHL-deficient RCCs. Results: PE inhibits the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways and consequently inhibits the EMT phenotype of pVHL-deficient ccRCCs. The effects of PE are concentration-dependent and affect not only biochemical markers of EMT (i.e., cadherin expression) but also functional manifestations of EMT, such as invasion. These effects are manifested within days of exposure to PE when diluted 2000-fold. Highly dilute concentrations of PE (10<sup>6</sup> dilution), which do not impact these pathways in the short term, were found to have NF-kappaB and JNK inhibitory effects and ability to reverse the EMT phenotype following prolonged exposure. Conclusion: These findings suggest that PE may mediate inhibition growth of pVHL-deficient ccRCCs and raises the possibility of its use as a dietary adjunct to managing patients with active surveillance for small, localized, incidentally identified renal tumors so as to avoid more invasive procedures such as nephrectomy.

N2  - Germline mutations in the RET, SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, MAX, TMEM127, NF1 or VHL genes are identified in about 30% of patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma and somatic mutations in RET, VHL or MAX genes are reported in 17% of sporadic tumors. In the present study, using mutation screening of the NF1 gene, mapping of chromosome aberrations by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, microarray-based expression profiling and immunohistochemistry (IHC), we addressed the implication of NF1 somatic alterations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We studied 53 sporadic tumors, selected because of their classification with RET/NF1/TMEM127-related tumors by genome wide expression studies, as well as a second set of 11 independent tumors selected on their low individual levels of NF1 expression evaluated by microarray. Direct sequencing of the NF1 gene in tumor DNA identified the presence of an inactivating NF1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases. Gene expression signature of NF1-related tumors highlighted the downregulation of NF1 and the major overexpression of SOX9. Among the second set of 11 tumors, two sporadic tumors carried somatic mutations in NF1 as well as in another susceptibility gene. These new findings suggest that NF1 loss of function is a frequent event in the tumorigenesis of sporadic pheochromocytoma and strengthen the new concept of molecular-based targeted therapy for pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.

N2  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Furthermore, dysregulation of miRNA expression is an important factor in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. Our previous study identified that overexpression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-induced protein 1 protein led to a significant downregulation of a novel miRNA molecule, miRNA-3613-3p. In the present study, the potential involvement of miRNA-3613-3p in the cell biology of neuroblastoma was investigated. It was identified that the expression of miRNA-3613-3p varies among a range of human neuroblastoma cell lines. As the delineation of the functions of a miRNA requires the identification of its target genes, seven putative mRNAs that may be regulated by miRNA-3613-3p were selected. Furthermore, it was identified that overexpression of miRNA-3613-3p causes significant downregulation of several genes exhibiting tumor suppressive potential [encoding apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1), Dicer, DNA fragmentation factor subunit beta, von Hippel-Lindau protein and neurofibromin 1] in BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cells. APAF1 mRNA was the most significantly decreased transcript in the cells with miRNA-3613-3p overexpression. In accordance with the aforementioned results, the downregulation of cleaved caspase-9 and lack of activation of executive caspases in BE(2)-C cells following miRNA-3613-3p overexpression was observed. The results of the present study suggest a potential underlying molecular mechanism of apoptosis inhibition via APAF1 downregulation in human neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells with miRNA-3613-3p overexpression.

N2  - A heightened understanding of hereditary renal cancer syndromes and their molecular basis has led to an increased awareness and recognition of these renal neoplasms by pathologists. Because a diagnosis of hereditary renal cell carcinoma has a profound impact on the patient and family members, when and how to raise such a suspicion via pathologic assessment has become an important yet very challenging task. This review discusses key clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic characteristics of hereditary renal cancer syndromes, and important differential diagnostic challenges, emphasizing recent pathologic and molecular advances.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that may occur sporadically or may be a manifestation of a hereditary disease, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2. As patients with VHL or MEN type 2 are at risk to develop multiple tumors, they must be distinguished from sporadic cases. We determined the incidence of VHL and MEN type 2 among 62 German patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma without a history of a hereditary disease. Germline analyses of the vhl gene and exons 10, 11, and 13 of the ret protooncogene were performed by PCR, single strand conformation polymorphism, enzyme digestion, or sequencing. Two patients (3%) showed vhl mutations (95% confidence interval, 1-11%). One patient showed loss of the MspI restriction site at nucleotides 712/713. Another patient had a C/T change at an intronic site that was also detected in 2 of his offspring. No mutations were detected in the ret protooncogene (97.5% confidence interval, 0-6%). In Germany, most sporadic pheochromocytomas are not due to VHL or MEN type 2. Therefore, clinical work-up in patients with pheochromocytoma without signs of hereditary disease is not recommended. However, because the costs of genetic screening are relatively low, and each index case allows optimal care for family members, molecular testing might be cost-effective.

N2  - The loss of heterozygosity of genes on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) in human breast carcinomas occurs in a region involved in other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, lung cancers, and von Hippel-Lindau disease. This finding suggests the presence of a gene(s) that plays a crucial role in multiple cancers. In our study of 84 informative (heterozygous) primary breast tumors, 30% showed losses of heterozygosity on chromosome 3. The shortest region of homozygosity in primary human breast tumor is located between the DNF15S2 and RAF1 loci in the 3p21-p25 region on the short arm of chromosome 3. This region includes at least two members of the c-erbA steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family (c-erbA beta and c-erbA2) that may be of special relevance to breast cancer. Furthermore, tumors with a loss of heterozygosity of genes on chromosome 3 were previously reported to have frequent allelic deletions on chromosome 11p and amplification of the c-myc proto-oncogene. These results highlight the occurrence of multiple genetic alterations in breast tumors.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) are the neuroendocrine tumours that arise in adrenal medulla or extra adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia. Paraganglia are small organs that mainly consist of neuroendocrine cells derived from the embryonic neural crest that have the ability to synthesize and secrete catecholamines. Sympathetic PGLs are usually located in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis while parasympathetic PGLs are distributed along parasympathetic nerves in the head, neck, and upper mediastinum, also referred to as head and neck PGL (HNP). PCC/PGLs can be either functional (sympathetic) or non-functional (parasympathetic) based on catecholamine synthesis and secretion. In children diagnosed with hypertension, up to 1.7% have a catecholamine-secreting neoplasm. The majority of these tumours in childhood are PCC/PGLs. Incidence rates of PCC/PGLs are estimated at 0.3 cases per million per year or less. Approximately 10 -20% of these cases are diagnosed during childhood. Approximately half of the apparently sporadic PCC/PGLs that present in patients younger than 18 years are due to an identifiable germline mutation and this increases up to 70% in children less than 10 years of age. Hereditary tumor syndromes associated with PCC include Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN-2), the familial PGL syndromes and rarely, neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1. Recently, many other genes are found to be involved in pathogenesis of PCC/PGLs. Hereditary PCC/PGLs are often multifocal and, in the case of PCC, frequently bilateral. Children usually present becauseof symptomatic catecholamine hypersecretion or, less often, due to tumor mass effects (e.g. pain), or as an incidental radiographic finding, or because of family screening. At present, the diagnostic test of choice is the measurement of fractionated plasma and/or urine metanephrines (metanephrines and normetanephrines). A four-fold increase above the reference range is associated with an almost 100% probability of the presence of a catecholamine-secreting tumor. 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine(MIBG) is a highly specific test that can confirm the catecholamine-secreting nature of a tumor, localize tumors not seen with cross-sectional imaging, and identify other sites of disease as well as metastasis. Because MIBG testingis not 100% sensitive, particularly in some genetic mutations, recently other functional scans have been studied in the evaluation of PCC/PGL: <sup>18</sup>F fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET), <sup>18</sup>F fluorodopamine (FDA) PET,<sup>18</sup>F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Surgical resection is the mainstay in the treatment of PCC/PGLs. It should be done after adequate alfa and beta adrenergic blockade to minimize the hemodynamic fluctuation during surgery. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the preferred procedure for most PCC. Laparotomy should be considered in patients with large PCC and/or a concern for underlying malignancy based upon the clinical presentation or radiographic appearance of the tumor. In the setting of bilateral PCC, cortical-sparing procedures should be considered for the adrenal with the least tumor bulk. The cortical-sparing approach is particularly attractive in young children and children at risk for noncompliance with lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. The surgical approach for removal of a PGL depends upon the location of the tumor but in selected cases can also be performed laparoscopically. Patients with unresectable malignant tumors or distant metastatic disease can usually be treated symptomatically with adrenergic blockade. Radiation therapy or radiofrequency ablation can help with symptomatic metastatic disease, and IV bisphosphonates can be considered bony metastases, particularly in patients with bone pain or lesions that increase the risk of pathological fracture. Systemic treatment modalities are only palliative in nature and include <sup>123</sup>I-MIBG therapy, peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) and chemother py. PCC/PGLs can have unpredictable behavior and metastasize late in the clinical course. In addition, children in particular are at risk for the development of metachronous tumors. This makes long-term follow-up mandatory in children with PCC/PGL.

N2  - Chromaffin cells are catecholamine-producing cells derived from neural crest tissue. Chromaffin tumors are rare tumors arising from these cells and are divided into pheochromocytoma arising from adrenal tissue and paraganglioma arising from extra-adrenal ganglia. Previously, ~10% were believed to be hereditary, but advances in genome sequencing have shown that roughly 35% of apparently sporadic tumors have a hereditary component. In this review, we describe both classic and newly discovered hereditary chromaffin tumors syndromes and provide recommendations for genetic testing. In many cases, the genes associated with these conditions are linked to common kidney cancer pathways familiar to urologic oncologists. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All Rights Reserved.

N2  - Renal neoplasms exhibit a wide spectrum of molecular characteristics that are closely associated with their diverse morphologic manifestations and clinical behaviors. A wealth of information has been garnered via methodology ranging from classical cytogenetics to FISH and gene expression profiling; however, the exact mechanisms by which each type of renal tumor develops remain incompletely understood. Oddly, tumors with distinctly different morphology and prognosis sometimes show some overlap in the observed genetic abnormalities; by contrast, morphologically well characterized benign and malignant tumors that seem intuitively related cannot necessarily be shown to exhibit a step-wise progression from benign to malignant biologic behavior. Nevertheless, modern methodologies have been highly successful, not only in subclassifying renal tumors, but also in defining previously unrecognized entities. Further avenues of utility for these methods probably include the resolution of challenging differential diagnoses, as well as application in targeted therapy and prediction of outcome. We review the molecular and genetic characteristics of renal neoplasms, with emphasis on markers that demonstrate utility in differentiating morphologically similar neoplasms and in predicting clinical outcome. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

N2  - Introduction Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is characterized by mutation or inactivation of Von Hippel-Lindau suppressor gene. The mutation of Von Hippel-Lindau mechanism is associated with the upregulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor protein, inducing the overexpression of proteins including erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors are widely used in treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In paradoxical hematological effect with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies, hemoglobin level may be increased, but polycythemia requiring phlebotomy is very rare. Case description We present here a case of renal cell carcinoma who received successive treatment with sunitinib, everolimus, and axitinib. While he had a normal hemoglobin level with prior sunitinib treatment, on the sixth week of axitinib treatment, he developed polycythemia and treatment response was seen after axitinib-associated polycythemia. Conclusion Progression-free survival (PFS) was 30 months in our case with third-line treatment axitinib. Higher hemoglobin levels may be associated with longer survival. Polycythemia was the first response to treatment of axitinib in our patient. It may be an indicator of persistent treatment response.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome that is the main cause of inherited clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which generally occurs in the form of multiple recurrent synchronized tumors. Affected patients are carriers of a germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Somatic mutations of this gene are also found in sporadic ccRCC and numerous pan-genomic studies have reported a dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in these sporadic tumors. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of VHL-associated ccRCC, particularly in the context of multiple tumors, the present study characterized the mRNA and miRNA transcriptome through an integrative analysis compared with sporadic renal tumors. In the present study, two series of ccRCC samples were used. The first set consisted of several samples from different tumors occurring in the same patient, for two independent patients affected with VHL disease. The second set consisted of 12 VHL-associated tumors and 22 sporadic ccRCC tumors compared with a pool of normal renal tissue. For each sample series, an expression analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs was conducted using microarrays. The results indicated that multiple tumors within the kidney of a patient with VHL disease featured a similar pattern of miRNA and gene expression. In addition, the expression levels of miRNA were able to distinguish VHL-associated tumors from sporadic ccRCC, and it was identified that 103 miRNAs and 2,474 genes were differentially expressed in the ccRCC series compared with in normal renal tissue. The majority of dysregulated genes were implicated in 'immunity' and 'metabolism' pathways. Taken together, these results allow a better understanding of the occurrence of ccRCC in patients with VHL disease, by providing insights into dysregulated miRNA and mRNA. In the set of patients with VHL disease, there were few differences in miRNA and mRNA expression, thus indicating a similar molecular evolution of these synchronous tumors and suggesting that the same molecular mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis of these hereditary tumors.

N2  - Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) developed as a result of technological advances in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), treatment planning, body stereotaxis, and motion management allows precise delivery of biologically potent dose to the tumor targets. Preclinical and clinical studies of SBRT have now demonstrated very promising results without significant toxicity in the treatment of primary and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lesions. The additional benefit of SBRT may be the abscopal (distant bystander) effect, mediated by an immunological response. In addition, high single-dose radiation such as SBRT may overcome radioresistance of RCC caused by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene mutation and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). As radiotherapy is not considered as a definitive treatment of RCC, a combination of radiotherapy and various systemic therapies has not been examined. However, SBRT could change the role of radiotherapy for RCC, and the development of combination therapy needs to be explored in the future trials. This review focused on the role of SBRT in the treatment of primary and metastatic RCC. Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The absence of functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene leads to the development of neoplasias characteristic of VHL disease, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, we compared the sensitivity of RCC cells lacking VHL gene function with that of RCC cells expressing the wild-type VHL gene (wtVHL) after exposure to various stresses. While the response to most treatments was not affected by the VHL gene status, glucose deprivation was found to be much more cytotoxic for RCC cells lacking VHL gene function than for wtVHL-expressing cells. The heightened sensitivity of VHL-deficient cells was not attributed to dissimilar energy requirements or to differences in glucose uptake, but more likely reflects a lesser ability of VHL-deficient cells to handle abnormally processed proteins arising from impaired glycosylation. In support of this hypothesis, other treatments which act through different mechanisms to interfere with protein processing (i.e., tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and azetidine) were also found to be much more toxic for VHL-deficient cells. Furthermore, ubiquitination of cellular proteins was elevated in VHL-deficient cells, particularly after glucose deprivation, supporting a role for the VHL gene in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Accordingly, the rate of elimination of abnormal proteins was lower in cells lacking a functional VHL gene than in wtVHL-expressing cells. Thus, pVHL appears to participate in the elimination of misprocessed proteins, such as those arising in the cell due to the unavailability of glucose or to other stresses.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant heritable disease that often occurs in association with various benign and malignant tumours. Clinically the disease is classified as VHL 1 (without phaeochromocytoma) and VHL 2 (with phaeochromocytoma). Genetically, VHL is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene. More than 100 germline mutations and rearrangements have been identified, but the biological function of a hypothetical VHL protein is not yet known. Genotype-phenotype correlations should aid in the understanding of this biological role. All VHL manifestations subsequently develop to VHL mutations, but some mutations may act in a tissue-specific manner. Whereas missense mutations cause tumour suppression to fail in adrenal cells, more severe structural mutations are usually necessary for tumour development in renal cells. As predicted bv the tumour suppressor theory, the VHL gene also plays a critical part in the pathogenesis of sporadic non-VHL-associated tumours. In a large number of sporadic renal clear cell carcinomas, mutations and hypermethylation cause inactivation of the VHL gene. Together with allelic 3 p loss, these constitute rate-limiting events in renal tumourigenesis. Insights into the molecular basis of phenotypic variability in VHL disease and the confirmation of the tumour-suppressor criteria in VHL and non-VHL sporadic tumours indicate an important role of the VHL gene in the development of these tumours.

N2  - In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), oncogenic autophagy dependent on microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha and beta (LC3A and LC3B) is stimulated by activity of the transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) channel through multiple complementary mechanisms. The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor represses this oncogenic autophagy in a coordinated manner through the activity of miR-204, which is expressed from intron 6 of the gene encoding TRPM3. TRPM3 represents an actionable target for ccRCC treatment.

N2  - Central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastoma (HB) is the most common tumor in the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disorder, the hereditary tumor syndrome caused by the biallelic mutations of the VHL gene. The disrupted VHL and Elongin protein interaction on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) induces a set of hypoxia-inducible genes, resulting in an unchecked endothelial cell proliferation that then leads to hemangioblastoma formation. However, recent studies have shown that disruptive germline mutations of VHL need not result in hemangioblastoma, though it can cause other manifestations of the VHL syndrome. Similarly, sporadic hemangioblastoma can occur rarely without a somatic biallelic VHL mutation. The VHL protein was earlier found to be associated with the deposition of matrix fibronectin (FN) protein in the renal extracellular matrix. The present study was designed to investigate the deposition of the matrix FN protein in VHL-associated hemangioblastoma. Seven HB tumor samples from the VHL syndrome had lower expressions of tissue FN compared to the control cerebellum samples or the control blood vessel sample. On comparing the VHL and FN protein expressions in a timed endothelial tube assay, the VHL protein expression was absent during the initial phase of tube formation but started expressing after 6 h. The levels of matrix form of FN gradually increased along with the VHL expression during the maturation of tube formation. Tube formation was found to be enhanced with extraneously added soluble FN and inhibited by matrix FN. Similarly, tube formation was inhibited by a modified tripeptide (RGD) inhibitor of integrin (-alphaVbeta3), namely, Cyclo-Ala-Arg-Gly-Asp-3-aminomethylbenzoyl. Our study implicates that the extracellular deposition and matrix formation of FN is important for vascular endothelial proliferation, and that its absence has roles in the development of hemangioblastoma in the VHL syndrome.

N2  - pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein) is the substrate recognition subunit of the CBC<sup>VHL</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor subunits, HIF-1/ 2alpha. Mutational inactivation ofpVHLcauses the hereditary von Hippel-Lindau tumor syndrome, which predisposes affected individuals to hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. Whereas the development of hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinomas has been attributed to impaired HIF-1/2alpha down-regulation by pVHL mutant proteins, the molecular defects underlying the development of pheochromocytomas are still unknown. Here, we present a detailed biochemical analysis of pVHL mutant proteins linked to type 2C (pheochromocytoma only) von Hippel-Lindau disease. Type 2C-associated mutations caused extensive structural perturbations of pVHL, as revealed by the reduced stability, increased proteolytic susceptibility, and dramatically altered NMR spectrum of recombinant, mutant pVHL-ElonginC-ElonginB complexes in vitro. In human cell lines, type 2C-linked mutations destabilized the CBC<sup>VHL</sup> ubiquitin ligase complex and resulted in reduced cellular pVHL levels. Together, our data reveal unexpectedly strong structural defects of type 2C-associated pVHL mutant proteins that are likely to affect both HIF-1/2alpha-related and -unrelated pVHL functions in the pathogenesis of pheochromocytomas. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

N2  - The rapid transit from hypoxia to normoxia in the lung that follows the first breath in newborn mice coincides with alveolar macrophage (AM) differentiation. However, whether sensing of oxygen affects AM maturation and function has not been previously explored. We have generated mice whose AMs show a deficient ability to sense oxygen after birth by deleting Vhl, a negative regulator of HIF transcription factors, in the CD11c compartment (CD11cDELTAVhl mice). VHL-deficient AMs show an immature-like phenotype and an impaired self-renewal capacity in vivo that persists upon culture ex vivo. VHL-deficient phenotype is intrinsic in AMs derived from monocyte precursors in mixed bone marrow chimeras. Moreover, unlike control Vhl<sup>fl/fl</sup>, AMs from CD11cDELTAVhl mice do not reverse pulmonary alveolar proteinosis when transplanted into Csf2rb<sup>-/-</sup> mice, demonstrating that VHL contributes to AM-mediated surfactant clearance. Thus, our results suggest that optimal AM terminal differentiation, self-renewal, and homeostatic function requires their intact oxygen-sensing capacity.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) is a devastating disease with limited therapeutic options available for advanced stages. The objective of this study was to investigate HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, as potential therapeutics for CC-RCC. Importantly, treatment with statins was found to be synthetically lethal with the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which occurs in 90% of CC-RCC driving the disease. This effect has been confirmed in three different CC-RCC cell lines with three different lipophilic statins. Inhibition of mevalonate synthesis by statins causes a profound cytostatic effect at nanomolar concentrations and becomes cytotoxic at low micromolar concentrations in VHL-deficient CC-RCC. The synthetic lethal effect can be fully rescued by both mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not by squalene, indicating that the effect is due to disruption of small GTPase isoprenylation and not the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of Rho and Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling contributes to the synthetic lethality effect, and overactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor signaling resulting from VHL loss is required. Finally, statin treatment is able to inhibit both tumor initiation and progression of subcutaneous 786-OT1-based CC-RCC tumors in mice. Thus, statins represent potential therapeutics for the treatment of VHL-deficient CC-RCC. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(8); 1781-92. ©2018 AACR.

N2  - Tumor suppressor proteins protect cells and tissues from malignant transformation. Among their diverse actions, many of these proteins interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton. This review focuses on the interactions of several tumor suppressors with microtubules and speculates on how disruption of microtubule-dependent processes may contribute to cancer development and spread. We conclude that several tumor suppressors stabilize microtubules and organize microtubule arrays, functions that are likely to be important in preventing tumorigenesis. How tumor suppressors link microtubule stability with cell fate, and how their mutation affects the response of cancer cells to anti-microtubule chemotherapy drugs, remains unclear; these should prove fertile areas for future research.

N2  - Objective To purify recombinant protein of human von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and identify its function. Methods VHL gene sequence was amplified from human mammary cDNA using PCR and inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-KG. Glutathione S-transferase-VHL (GST-VHL) recombinant plasmid we obtained was converted into BL21(DE3) sensitive bacteria to induce a small amount of GST-VHL protein. The expressed product was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The recombinant protein was purified by GST beads and its function was verified by GST pull-down assay. Results The obtained recombinant plasmid could be successfully digested by double enzymes. Gene sequencing showed that the VHL sequence was correct and there was no mutation. The recombinant protein with approximately relative molecular mass (M<sub>r</sub>) 56 000 was purified by converting recombinant plasmid to BL21(DE3) sensitive bacteria and inducing it in small quantities. GST pull-down assay verified that GST-VHL recombinant protein had the function of binding hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in vitro. Conclusion GST-VHL recombinant protein is purified and can combine with HIF-1alpha protein in vitro.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterised by the presence of multiple cysts and tumours. The mutation involves VHL gene, a tumour suppressor gene. The clinical presentation may be quite variable. VHLD should be suspected when a patient with family history of VHLD presents a typical lesion, such as central nervous system or retinal hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts or endocrine tumour, epididymal cystadenoma or endolymphatic sac tumour. Alternatively, to establish the diagnosis in a patient without familiar background for the referred disease, two or more hemangioblastomas of central nervous system and/or retina or a single hemangioblastoma of central nervous system or retina associated with another lesion, namely renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts or endocrine tumour or epididymal cystadenoma are required. Morbidity and mortality are mainly related to neurological damage determined by central nervous system hemangioblastomas and also to renal cell carcinoma metastasis. It is advisable to create a follow-up protocol and to adjust it to each single patient, aiming at an early detection and an adequate treatment of clinical manifestations, towards an improved prognosis. © 2012 Sociedade Portuguesa de Endocrinologia, Diabetes e Metabolismo.

N2  - Hereditary central nervous tumor syndromes are a varied group of conditions that include neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2, tuberous sclerosis, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, and Cowden, Turcot, and Gorlin syndromes. The responsible genes have been identified in most of these disorders. These genes typically act as tumor suppressor genes, maintain normal cellular function and homeostasis, and regulate cell growth and differentiation. Familial central nervous system tumors are mostly inherited as autosomal dominant traits and involve germline mutations. Neoplastic development occurs when a somatic mutation inactivates the second allele. These patients also present unique challenges for their management. This review highlights the clinical manifestations, molecular genetics, pathophysiology, and current treatment options of these disorders with a focus on neuro-oncologic manifestations of the diseases.

N2  - The ocular manifestations of a large von Hippel-Lindau pedigree are presented. Of 24 persons with retinal angiomas, 18 are living and are the basis of this report. Nineteen of their 28 affected eyes were asymptomatic with 2 to 4 small tumours per eye. Nine eyes had lost vision secondary to exudative detachment. Seven of these had peripheral disease with rapid recurrences. Two had untreated disc tumours. Tumours less than 1 disc diameter (DD) in size were easily treated with photocoagulation. Multiple treatments of cryotherapy were required for larger tumours. Scleral buckle and early vitrectomy are recommended for vitreous traction. Tumour in a 4-year-old and a de-novo tumour in a 42-year-old lead us to recommend life-time surveillance of patients at risk. Many patients had false negative family histories. A review of the literature leads us to suspect that the majority of retinal angiomas are familial. We emphasize the ophthalmologist's responsibility to investigate such patients.

N2  - We analyzed the clinical, hormonal, immunohistochemical and genetic features in a 69-yr-old Caucasian woman with a very rare "composite and mixed pheochromocytoma". This was characterized by right adrenal pheochromocytoma associated with homolateral ganglioneuroma and controlateral adrenal cortical adenoma. The three tumors, incidentally discovered, proved to be non-functioning (normal secretion of catecholamines and of other neuroendocrine peptides, glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids and androgens). Accordingly, the patient showed no sign or symptom of endocrine disease. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) demonstrated a typical adenomatous lesion on the left adrenal gland with precocious uptake of the radiotracer on radioidine (131I)-norcholesterol adrenal scintigraphy, while the controlateral gland showed hyperdensity on CT, hyperintensity on MR and no uptake at adrenal scintigraphy. In addition, CT and MR revealed a vertebral and two hepatic hemangiomas. The right adrenal gland was surgically removed and, microscopically, pheochromocytoma and ganglioneuroma areas appeared intermixed without a predominant component. The former showed strong immunoreactivity for chromogranin, synaptophysin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD34, while the latter appeared positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S-100. Peripheral blood genomic DNA analysis revealed a new intronic variant (5557A > G) in the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) not observed in our control population.

N2  - Clear cell variant of epithelioid mesothelioma is an extremely rare tumor with only isolated cases reported so far in the peritoneum. Here, we report a case of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma, clear cell variant, in a 63-year-old female patient with a novel VHL gene mutation and an unusual indolent clinical course. The patient, who has no clinical history of asbestos exposure, presented with a 27.2-cm upper abdominal mass and a 5.5-cm liver lesion. Retrospective review of the patient's abdominal computed tomographic scan 4 years ago showed 2 small abdominal lesions that were felt clinically to represent hemangiomas. These were retrospectively considered to have grown in size and represented the current abdominal mass. Both masses were subsequently biopsied and showed a proliferation of monomorphic epithelioid cells with distinct cell membranes, fine chromatin, and clear to finely vacuolated pale eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in nests and solid sheets. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed it to be malignant mesothelioma. Clear cell variant of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma should always be considered in patients with an abdominal or pelvic mass with clear cell features. Given the rarity of such entity, its clinical course and prognosis remains unclear. Copyright © 2018 The Authors

N2  - The therapeutic landscape for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed drastically over the past several years with the emergence of molecularly targeted therapies. With previous prognostic and predictive tools based on studies of patients treated with cytokine therapies, confirmation of these prior methods and discovery of new markers in this new era of targeted therapy are of great importance. Alteration of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) by mutation, loss of heterozygosity, and promoter methylation has been found to be important to RCC pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the potential role of VHL mutation as a prognostic and predictive marker for RCC. [References: 46]

N2  - Clear cell renal carcinomas are most frequently characterized by loss of function of both copies of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease gene, suggesting that the VHL gene product plays an important role in regulating renal cell proliferation. To directly assess the function of the VHL gene product, we transfected the wild-type VHL gene into two renal carcinoma cell lines that lacked normal expression of the gene. Expression of the wild-type VHL gene led to a dramatic suppression of growth in two renal carcinoma cell lines, A498 and UMRC6 in vitro, as measured by colony formation and direct cell counting. Transfection of a naturally occurring mutant VHL gene (nucleotide 713 G to A, Arg to Gln) did not lead to growth suppression of these renal carcinoma cells, nor did transfection of the wild-type VHL gene into two non-renal tumor cell lines that expressed the endogenous wild-type VHL gene. Expression constructs, which included the first ATG at nucleotide 214, were sufficient to produce the strongest growth suppression. These experiments provide direct evidence that the VHL gene product functions to suppress the growth of renal carcinoma cells and also provide a model for mapping the domains of the VHL protein important in suppressing tumor growth.

N2  - The simplest molecular mechanism of hereditary tumorigenesis is represented by retinoblastoma (RB). Knudson's model specifies that, in hereditary RB, the first mutation in an allele of the RB gene exists in the germline. A subsequent somatic mutation in the second normal RB allele releases RB formation in the eye. This mechanism of loss of function of both normal tumor suppressor gene copies applies to other hereditary cancer syndromes as well, including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and probably familial breast/ovarian syndrome. In some syndromes, e.g. familial adenomatous polyposis and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, the mechanism may be slightly different. Loss of function of only one allele of the susceptibility locus appears to be sufficient to promote a proliferative advantage in target tissues. In many of these inherited cancer syndromes, variable expression and variable penetrance of phenotypes exist. Allelism, existence of a multigene complex, or modulation of expression by modifier genes may explain the phenomena.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited tumor susceptibility syndrome featuring a high variety of benign and malignant tumors. The gene has been localized and cloned at 3p25-26. Recent functional analysis defined the VHL gene product as an inhibitor of the transcription elongation process. Its possible involvement in the vascularization process may explain the histologic features of VHL tumors providing insight into basic mechanism of tumorigenesis. Direct genetic testing is available for patients affected with VHL. Seventy to eighty percent of the germline mutations expected could be detected. As first geno/phenotype correlations have been established, we are now beginning to understand the diversity of this fascinating disease at the molecular level. As mutational analysis proved to be of striking prognostic significance, gene testing became an important tool for the management of the disease. The VHL gene was also found to be responsible for tumorigenesis in the corresponding sporadic tumors, especially in the clear cell type of renal cell carcinomas. The understanding of the normal and disturbed function of the VHL gene product will enable us to develop treatment strategies based on and targeted at the molecular cause of the disease. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about genetics, clinics, and function of VHL. [References: 127]

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by an infrequent number of somatic mutations. By contrast, epigenetic aberrations are commonly found in RCC, indicating that epigenetic reprogramming is an important event in RCC development. Epigenetic alterations comprise several different aberrations, such as changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNA levels, and occur in the most important signalling pathways in RCC, such as the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor (VHL)-hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, the WNT-beta-catenin pathway, and pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Owing to their involvement in these pathways and frequent occurrence in RCC, epigenetic alterations are regarded as potential biomarkers for the early detection of disease and for prediction of prognosis and treatment response. In addition, most of these alterations are potentially reversible, so they also provide new targets for therapy. At the moment, epigenetic biomarkers for RCC are not being used in clinical practice, but targeted epigenetic therapies are under investigation. Understanding the extent of epigenetic changes occurring in RCC and the mechanisms by which they influence disease progression and treatment response, as well as knowledge of current research on biomarkers and treatments, is crucial to successful clinical translation of epigenetics in RCC.

N2  - The CRISPR-based technology has revolutionized genome editing in recent years. This technique allows for gene knockout and evaluation of function in cell lines in a manner that is far easier and more accessible than anything previously available. Unfortunately, the ability to extend these studies to in vivo syngeneic murine cell line implantation is limited by an immune response against cells transduced to stably express Cas9. In this study, we demonstrate that a non-integrating lentiviral vector approach can overcome this immune rejection and allow for the growth of transduced cells in an immunocompetent host. This technique enables the establishment of a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene knockout RENCA cell line in BALB/c mice, generating an improved model of immunocompetent, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

N2  - Context: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas have a highly diverse genetic background, with a third of the cases carrying a germline mutation in 1 of 14 identified genes. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate next-generation sequencing for more efficient genetic testing of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma and to establish germline and somatic mutation frequencies for all known susceptibility genes. Design: A targeted next-generation sequencing approach on an Illumina MiSeq instrument was used for a mutation analysis in 86 unselected pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma tumor samples. The study included the genes EGLN1, EPAS1, KIF1Bbeta, MAX, MEN1, NF1, RET, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, TMEM127, and VHL. Results were verified in tumor and constitutional DNA with Sanger sequencing. Results: In all cases with clinical syndromes or known germline mutations, a mutation was detected in the expected gene. Among 68 nonfamilial tumors, 32 mutations were identified in 28 of the samples (41%), including germline mutations in EGLN1, KIF1Bbeta, SDHA, SDHB, and TMEM127 and somatic mutations in EPAS1, KIF1Bbeta, MAX, NF1, RET, and VHL, including one double monoallelic EPAS1 mutation. Conclusions: Targeted next-generation sequencing proved to be fast and cost effective for the genetic analysis of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. More than half of the tumors harbored mutations in the investigated genes. Notably, 7% of the apparently sporadic cases carried germline mutations, highlighting the importance of comprehensive genetic testing. KIF1Bbeta, which previously has not been investigated in a large cohort, appears to be an equally important tumor suppressor as MAX and TMEM127 and could be considered for genetic testing of these patients.

N2  - Unlabelled: BACKGROUND: Cilia are essential organelles in multiple organ systems, including the kidney where they serve as important regulators of renal homeostasis. Renal nephron cilia emanate from the apical membrane of epithelia, extending into the lumen where they function in flow-sensing and ligand-dependent signaling cascades. Ciliary dysfunction underlies renal cyst formation that is in part caused by deregulation of planar cell polarity and canonical Wnt signaling. Renal cancer pathologies occur sporadically or in heritable syndromes caused by germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes including VHL. Importantly, Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) patients frequently develop complex renal cysts that can be considered a premalignant stage. One of the well-characterized molecular functions of VHL is its requirement for the maintenance of cilia. In this study, tissue from 110 renal cancer patients who underwent nephrectomy was analyzed to determine if lower ciliary frequency is a common hallmark of renal tumorigenesis by comparing cilia frequencies in both tumor and adjacent parenchymal tissue biopsies from the same kidney. METHODS: We stained sections of human renal material using markers for cilia. Preliminary staining was performed using an immunofluorescent approach and a combination of acetylated-alpha-tubulin and pericentrin antibodies and DAPI. After validation of an alternative, higher throughput approach using acetylated-alpha-tubulin immunohistochemistry, we continued to manually quantify cilia in all tissues. Nuclei were separately counted in an automated fashion in order to determine ciliary frequencies. Similar staining and scoring for Ki67 positive cells was performed to exclude that proliferation obscures cilia formation potential. RESULTS: Samples from renal cell carcinoma patients deposited in our hospital tissue bank were previously used to compose a tissue microarray containing three cores of both tumor and parenchymal tissue per patient. Cilia frequencies in a total of eighty-nine clear cell, eight papillary, five chromophobe renal cell carcinomas, two sarcomatoid renal tumors and six oncocytomas were determined. A marked decrease of primary cilia across renal cell carcinoma subtypes was observed compared to adjacent nontumorigenic tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that cilia are predominantly lost in renal cell carcinomas compared to tissue of the tumor parenchyma. These results suggest that ciliary loss is common in renal tumorigenesis, possibly participating in the sequence of cellular events leading to malignant tumor development. Future therapies aimed at restoring or circumventing cilia signaling might therefore aid in current treatment efficacy.

N2  - Objective: To calculate and discuss the percentage of imbalance for selected cancer predisposition genes in patients referred for routine diagnostic array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Design: Audit of findings from application of array CGH for patients referred for developmental delay, behavioural abnormalities and birth defects in 4805 patients referred to Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust for cytogenetic investigation from South East London, Kent and East Sussex and other genetic centres across the UK. Results: 29 of 4805 (0.6%) patients examined by array CGH had genomic imbalance of <5 Mb involving cancer predisposition genes. Six patients were referred for syndromes involving cancer predisposition genes; none of the other 23 patients with array CGH findings in cancer predisposition genes had any symptoms/family history stated on their referral form suggestive for the respective syndrome. Twelve whole gene deletions, two partial deletions, 12 duplications, two partial duplications, and one mosaic duplication were observed. In 17/29 patients (59%), inheritance could not be established, eight imbalances were de novo, and four inherited. Conclusions: This new technology raises the possibility of unexpected findings in cancer predisposition genes. Therefore, the possibility of such findings has to be addressed in pre-test and post-test counselling by genetically trained healthcare professionals. As many of these findings have not been described previously, their clinical significance is unknown and patients need long-term follow-up to determine their clinical relevance. This will enable genetic healthcare professionals to advise such people about their cancer risks and appropriate cancer risk management options.

N2  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism by integrating growth factor stimulation and energy/nutrient input through a complex signaling network. The mTOR kinase is a part of two structurally and functionally distinct multiple protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is rapamycin-sensitive and mediates temporal control of cell growth by regulating several cellular processes, such as translation, transcription, and nutrient transport while the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is insensitive to rapamycin and is involved in spatial control of cell growth via cytoskeleton regulation. Here we discuss the mechanism of mTOR regulation in tumor malignancy through a variety of signaling pathways and the potential of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Usually sporadic, pheochromocytoma can, on occasion, complicate genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis 1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2; some families seem to have just pheochromocytoma, where it may have occurred by chance. The natural history of a large kindred believed to have an excess of pheochromocytoma 34 years ago was followed with the hypothesis that the predisposition was, in fact, present and that family education and surveillance would decrease mortality. METHODS: Prospective observation and diagnostic surveillance for pheochromocytoma were conducted on the inception cohort, defined as three branches of the kindred in 1960. Of 619 descendants of three (of 11) siblings of German origin, 333 were evaluated in person at least once in the three decades of surveillance. No pheochromocytomas were known to have occurred in the eight other branches. A total of 522 persons from the 11 branches were evaluated. RESULTS: Five of the eight initial patients with pheochromocytoma died of cardiovascular complications attributable to the tumor. In follow-up, eight additional relatives were newly diagnosed with pheochromocytomas (at an average age of 19 years), and others had additional or recurrent pheochromocytomas, meningioma, para-adrenal paraganglioma, and a functioning glomus vagale; none died. CONCLUSIONS: A continuing excess of pheochromocytoma seems present in the family. Whether the incompletely penetrant gene in this family is allelic to the von Hippel-Lindau gene on chromosome 3 or is a distinct locus remains to be resolved with molecular studies. Meanwhile, education and surveillance seem to decrease mortality from pheochromocytoma in this family.

N2  - Purpose The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor is inactivated in the majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs), leading to inappropriate stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha). PT2385 is a first-in-class HIF-2alpha antagonist. Objectives of this first-in-human study were to characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy, and to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PT2385. Patients and Methods Eligible patients had locally advanced or metastatic ccRCC that had progressed during one or more prior regimens that included a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. PT2385 was administered orally at twice-per-day doses of 100 to 1,800 mg, according to a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design, followed by an expansion phase at the RP2D. Results The dose-escalation and expansion phases enrolled 26 and 25 patients, respectively. Patients were heavily pretreated, with a median of four (range, one to seven) prior therapies. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed at any dose. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiling, the RP2D was defined as 800 mg twice per day. PT2385 was well tolerated, with anemia (grade 1 to 2, 35%; grade 3, 10%), peripheral edema (grade 1 to 2, 37%; grade 3, 2%), and fatigue (grade 1 to 2, 37%; no grade 3 or 4) being the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. No patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Complete response, partial response, and stable disease as best response were achieved by 2%, 12%, and 52% of patients, respectively. At data cutoff, eight patients remained in the study, with 13 patients in the study for >= 1 year. Conclusion PT2385 has a favorable safety profile and is active in patients with heavily pretreated ccRCC, validating direct HIF-2alpha antagonism for the treatment of patients with ccRCC.

N1  - no phenotype provided and study did correlational analysis involving gene-gene interactions
    	Lv, CaiBai, ZhimingLiu, ZhenxiangLuo, PengchengZhang, Jie
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to explore the association of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with VHL (rs779805), MTHFR (rs1801133) and APOE (rs8106822 and rs405509) polymorphisms, investigate the interactions among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and explore roles of the interactions in the pathogenesis of RCC in Chinese Han population. METHODS: 81 RCC patients and 80 healthy controls were included in the study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing methods were used in the analysis on the genotypes of APOE, VHL and MTHFR gene polymorphisms. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was adopted to conduct gene-gene interaction analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were utilized to evaluate the correlation between gene-gene interactions and RCC risk. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between RCC risk and 3 SNPs (rs8106822, rs779805 and rs1801133). Genotype AA and allele A of APOE rs8106822 were significantly associated with RCC susceptibility (OR=2.65, 95% CI=1.05-6.69). Meanwhile, we found that the frequencies of genotype GG and allele G were much higher in case group, compared with controls (P<0.05 for both) and they appeared to be risk factors for RCC (OR=2.90, 95% CI=1.22-6.87; OR=1.78, 95% CI=1.14-2.27). While, allele T of MTHFR rs1801133 could decrease the risk of RCC (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.40-0.97). MDR analysis showed that gene-gene interactions among APOE, VHL and MTHFR SNPs were closely related with RCC susceptibility. CONCLUSION: APOE, VHL and MTHFR gene polymorphisms were related to the risk of RCC. The interactions among APOE, VHL and MTHFR genes could increase the risk of RCC.

N2  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Spinal nerve root hemangioblastomas are rare and are reported mainly in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. The pathogenesis of so-called nonfamilial lesions is virtually unknown. We discuss, mainly from a molecular perspective, a unique patient with sporadic, recurrent hemangioblastomas restricted to spinal nerve roots. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old man who had had a surgically corrected lumbosacral meningomyelocele presented on at least three occasions during a 17-year period with multifocal capillary hemangioblastomas involving spinal nerve roots. On each occasion, tumors appeared on a different nerve root, with the majority located in the midcervical segments. The patient had no clinical features or family history of VHL syndrome. TECHNIQUE: To obtain a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of this unusual case and its relationship to VHL syndrome, molecular analysis of the VHL gene was performed by use of complete sequence analysis and loss of heterozygosity studies on deoxyribonucleic acid derived from the patient's blood leukocytes and three separately resected hemangioblastomas. CONCLUSION: Germ-line molecular analysis performed on all three exons in the VHL gene coding region did not indicate that any mutations were present. Loss of heterozygosity analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid from the three hemangioblastoma resections showed normal heterozygosity in the 3p25-26 region. Complete VHL gene sequence analysis did not demonstrate a somatic mutation in the coding region of the VHL gene in any of the three tumors, thereby supporting the loss of heterozygosity data that a molecular event directly involving the VHL gene may not be the causative factor in their tumorigenesis.

N2  - The discovery of a relationship for the VHL tumor suppressor gene, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the growth of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has identified a pathway for novel targeted therapy. This study evaluated the impact of these agents on metastatic RCC (mRCC), and highlights recent phase II and III trials. A systematic review examined the clinical data for novel targeted agents in mRCC, with a focus on randomized phase II and III trials of the novel targeted agents sunitinib, temsirolimus, sorafenib, and bevacizumab. Several agents, including the small-molecule targeted inhibitors sunitinib, temsirolimus, sorafenib, and the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, have demonstrated antitumor activity in randomized trials. Superior activity was found with sunitinib and temsirolimus versus cytokines in first-line therapy. Improved progression-free survival was reported with sorafenib and bevacizumab given second-line compared with placebo. Targeted therapies show promising activity in this disease, and they have been changing patient management. Sunitinib and sorafenib were recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mRCC, These drugs are currently included in clinical practice. [References: 51]

N2  - Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma is a rare renal cell carcinoma with an excellent prognosis. To clarify the relationship with typical clear cell renal cell carcinoma, we evaluated 15 cases of multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas diagnosed according to the 2004 WHO classification. Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene mutations were determined by whole genome amplification and direct sequencing. Carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX), a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target, paired box gene 2 (PAX2), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3beta) were immunohistochemically evaluated as members of the VHL protein (pVHL)- and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-controlled pathways. VHL mutations were identified in 3 of 12 (25%) tumors. Inactivated GSK3beta, decreased PTEN expression and PAX2 positivity were observed in the vast majority of the multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas. Strong nuclear staining of p27 was seen in 14 of 15 cases. Compared with multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas, expression frequencies of PAX2, p-GSK3beta, PTEN and CAIX were similar in a set of low-grade, early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinomas, whereas only 30% had strong p27 positivity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas are related at the molecular level with clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Maintenance of a strong subcellular p27 expression in all multilocular cystic renal cell carcinomas analyzed may in part explain the excellent prognosis of these tumor patients.

N2  - Tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) are a heterogeneous group of transmembrane proteins involved in signal transduction. These receptors are expressed in many different cells and regulate cellular growth, differentiation and angiogenesis. Overexpression and/or the structural alteration of different RTKs classes are generally associated to cancer and, when RTKs-mediated signal transduction pathways are abnormally activated, generate cancer growth, angiogenesis and metastatization. Therapeutic intervention targeting RTKs concerns antagonist drugs as little molecules or monoclonal antibodies. Sunitinib malate is a little molecule able to block intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of RTKs, which has both direct anticancer and antiangiogenetic activity. Sunitinib targets selectively vascular endothelial growth factor, KIT, Flt3 and platelet-derived growth factor receptors and the receptor encoded by the ret proto-oncogene. This drug is used in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal cancer (GIST) resistant to imatinib and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In this review, we report preclinical data of sunitinib, even about synergism with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, data relative to phase III trials of sunitinib in the treatment of GIST and RCC, and we try to plan what will be future applications of sunitinib in different types of cancer, even in association to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and monoclonal antibodies. © 2007 European Society for Medical Oncology.

N2  - Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are rare in von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) but cause serious morbidity and mortality. Management guidelines for VHL-PanNETs continue to be based on limited evidence, and survival data to guide surgical management are lacking. We established the European-American-Asian-VHL-PanNET-Registry to assess data for risks for metastases, survival and long-term outcomes to provide best management recommendations. Of 2330 VHL patients, 273 had a total of 484 PanNETs. Median age at diagnosis of PanNET was 35 years (range 10-75). Fifty-five (20%) patients had metastatic PanNETs. Metastatic PanNETs were significantly larger (median size 5 vs 2cm; P<0.001) and tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was faster (22 vs 126 months; P=0.001). All metastatic tumors were >=2.8cm. Codons 161 and 167 were hotspots for VHL germline mutations with enhanced risk for metastatic PanNETs. Multivariate prediction modeling disclosed maximum tumor diameter and TVDT as significant predictors for metastatic disease (positive and negative predictive values of 51% and 100% for diameter cut-off >=2.8cm, 44% and 91% for TVDT cut-off of <=24 months). In 117 of 273 patients, PanNETs >1.5cm in diameter were operated. Ten-year survival was significantly longer in operated vs non-operated patients, in particular for PanNETs <2.8cm vs >=2.8cm (94% vs 85% by 10 years; P=0.020; 80% vs 50% at 10 years; P=0.030). This study demonstrates that patients with PanNET approaching the cut-off diameter of 2.8cm should be operated. Mutations in exon 3, especially of codons 161/167 are at enhanced risk for metastatic PanNETs. Survival is significantly longer in operated non-metastatic VHL-PanNETs.

N2  - OBJECT: Hemangioblastomas of the brainstem constitute 5 to 10% of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. At present, optimal management of brainstem hemangioblastomas associated with VHL disease is incompletely defined. In an attempt to clarify some of the uncertainty about the operative treatment of these lesions and its outcome, the authors reviewed all cases of VHL disease in which resection of brainstem hemangioblastomas was performed at the National Institutes of Health during a 10-year period. METHODS: Twelve consecutive patients with VHL disease (six male and six female patients [mean age 31.7 +/- 9 years; range 15-46 years]) who underwent 13 operations to remove 17 brainstem hemangioblastomas were included in this study (mean follow-up period, 88.4 +/- 37.4 months; range 37-144 months). Serial examinations, hospital charts, magnetic resonance images, and operative records were reviewed. To evaluate clinical course, clinical grades were assigned to each patient before and after surgery. Preoperative neurological function was the best predictor of long-term outcome. In addition, patients who underwent CNS surgeries for hemangioblastomas were more likely to improve or to remain neurologically stable. Tumor or cyst size, the presence of a cyst, or the location of the tumor (intramedullary, extramedullary, or mixed; posterior medullary, obex, or lateral) did not affect outcome. No patient was neurologically worse after brainstem surgery. At long-term follow-up review (mean 88.4 months), only one patient had declined neurologically and this was due to the cumulative neurological effects caused by eight additional hemangioblastomas of the spinal cord and their surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Brainstem hemangioblastomas in patients with VHL disease can be removed safely; they generally should be resected when they become symptomatic or when the tumor has reached a size such that further growth will increase the risks associated with surgery, or in the presence of an enlarging cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging is usually sufficient for preoperative evaluation and presurgical embolization is unnecessary. The goal of surgery is complete resection of the lesion before the patient experiences a disabling neurological deficit.

N2  - Capillary hemangioblastomas (CHBs) are vascular, usually benign, tumors of the CNS, occurring either as a component of familial von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease or as a sporadic entity. Both familial and sporadic forms of VHL-associated tumors involve inactivation of the VHL gene; for CHB, 20% to 50% of sporadic cases are affected. However, other molecular alterations involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic CHBs, which represent up to 70% of CHBs, remain largely unknown. We previously identified a minimal deleted area at 6q23-24 in CHB, and the present study focused on the ZAC1 gene (6q24-25). ZAC1 is a maternally imprinted tumor suppressor gene with antiproliferative properties. We investigated loss of heterozygosity (LOH), promoter methylation, and expression status of ZAC1 in mainly sporadic cases of CHB. Our LOH analysis with 6 microsatellite markers spanning the ZAC1 gene region revealed a high frequency (6 of 10, 60%) of LOH. The promoter methylation analysis detected predominance of the methylated ZAC1 sequence in the majority (9 of 10, 90%) of the tumors. Immunohistochemistry exhibited a strongly reduced expression of ZAC1 in stromal cells of all CHBs studied. Collectively, our current results indicate that the absence of the unmethylated ZAC1 sequence was highly concurrent with ZAC1 region LOH or 6q loss and with lack of ZAC1 expression, suggesting preferential loss of the nonimprinted, expressed ZAC1 allele in CHB. This novel finding highlights the importance of ZAC1 in development of CHB, particularly in non-VHL-associated cases.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an uncommon, autosomal dominant hereditary multitumor syndrome caused by germline alterations of the VHL gene, which has been cloned recently and identified as a tumor suppressor gene. The major lesions in VHL disease include hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system and retina, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, pancreatic tumors, epididymal cystadenomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, carcinoid tumors, and multiple cysts of the kidney, pancreas, and epididymis. Compared with sporadic ones, the tumors in VHL disease develop at an earlier age and often multifocally. Histologic features of VHL tumors are characterized by their high degree of vascularization and the presence of a clear cell component. Hypervascularization is induced by overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and because the principal function of VHL protein is the negative regulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs including VEGF mRNA, inactivation of VHL gene plays critical roles in angiogenesis of the VHL tumors. In addition, since VHL protein is also required for the down-regulation of transcription activity of certain genes for the cell growth and cell cycle, inactivation of VHL gene may contribute to tumorigenesis of the VHL tumors. A significant difference in the frequency of types of VHL gene mutation has been noted among the affected families, known as the genotype-phenotype correlations.

N2  - Synthetic lethality is based on the incompatibility of cell survival with the loss of function of two or more genes, not with loss of function of a single gene. If targets of synthetic lethality are deregulated or mutated in cancer cells, the strategy of synthetic lethality can result in significant increase of therapeutic efficacy and a favourable therapeutic window. In this review, we discuss synthetic lethality based on deficient DNA repair mechanisms, activating mutations of RAS, loss of function mutations of the tumor suppressor genes p53, Rb and von Hippel-Lindau, and disruption of interactive protein kinase networks in the context of development of new anticancer agents.

N2  - We have studied a cohort of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) with smooth-muscle stroma (N=6), which lacked any of following genetic aberrations: Mutations in the VHL-gene-coding sequence, loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3p, or hypermethylation of VHL. Using targeted next-generation sequencing, no intronic VHL mutations or mutations in selected genes involved in angiogenesis and genes frequently mutated in clear cell RCC were identified. Tumors were also tested for the presence of hotspot mutations in the TCEB1 gene with negative results in all cases. We conclude that there exists a group of RCCs with abundant leiomyomatous stroma, where the epithelial component is indistinguishable from conventional clear cell RCC and distinct from clear cell (tubulo-) papillary RCC and that these tumors lack aberrations related to the function of the VHL gene, mutations in genes involved in angiogenesis, and hotspot mutations in the TCEB1 gene.

N2  - Sporadic and hereditary forms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and the familial paraganglioma syndromes are closely related in terms of their clinical, molecular, and genetic aspects. Most RCCs occur sporadically and the heritable fraction of RCC is estimated to be just 2-4%. An understanding of the molecular genetic basis, the disease-specific and gene-specific biology and the clinical characteristics of these cancer syndromes is of utmost importance for effective genetic diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In addition, such insight will improve our understanding of sporadic RCCs. To date, 10 different heritable RCC syndromes have been described. VHL syndrome is the oldest known hereditary RCC syndrome. Similar to VHL disease, phaeochromocytoma is a major manifestation of the paraganglioma syndromes types 1, 3 and 4 in which RCCs have been reported. These syndromes are therefore regarded as VHL-related disorders and are included in this Review. Multifocal tumours, bilateral occurrence, a young age at diagnosis and/or family history are clinical red flags suggestive of hereditary disease and should trigger referral for genetic and molecular analysis. The identification of an underlying genetic alteration enables gene-specific risk assessment and opens up the possibility of a tailored follow-up strategy and specific surveillance protocols as the basis of effective preventive medicine. The important goals of preventive medicine are to increase the life expectancy of affected patients and to improve their quality of life. The study of seemingly rare hereditary syndromes and their susceptibility genes has consistently revealed clues regarding the aetiology and pathogenesis of these diseases, and can aid diagnosis and the development of therapeutics for patients affected by much more common sporadic counterparts.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) provides a tumor paradigm for the integration of genetics, molecular biology, therapeutic target validation and the introduction of high-impact treatment strategies. Most cases of sporadic as well as familial ccRCC acquire somatic inactivating mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene, VHL. pVHL, VHL gene product and a protein member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, acts in normal cells to direct the degradation and clearance of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)alpha transcription factor family, such that in its absence, as in ccRCC, the HIF proteins stabilize, accumulate to supraphysiologic levels and activate the transcription of genes such as VEGF and PDGF, which contributes substantially to the physiology of the tumor, and has been assessed indirectly as a prognostic factor. Molecularly targeted therapy blocking components of this pathway has been successfully introduced to the clinic with a substantive impact on clinical parameters of RCC. This review will examine the regulation of these molecular pathways in RCC and discuss the impact on the clinical management of patients with RCC. [References: 93]

N2  - PURPOSE: Clear cell, papillary cell, and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) have now been well characterised thanks to large collaborative projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Not only has knowledge of the genomic landscape helped inform the development of new drugs, it also promises to fine tune prognostication.METHODS: A literature review was performed summarising the current knowledge on the genetic basis of RCC.RESULTS: The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene undergoes bi-allelic knockout in the vast majority of clear cell RCCs. The next most prevalent aberrations include a cohort of chromatin-modifying genes with diverse roles including PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, and KMD5C. The most common non-clear cell renal cancers have also undergone genomic profiling and are characterised by distinct genomic landscapes. Many recurrent mutations have prognostic value and show promise in aiding decisions regarding treatment stratification. Intra-tumour heterogeneity appears to hamper the clinical applicability of sparsely sampled tumours. Ways to abrogate heterogeneity will be required to optimise the genomic classification of tumours.CONCLUSION: The somatic mutational landscape of the more common renal cancers is well known. Correlation with outcome needs to be more comprehensively furnished, particularly for small renal masses, rarer non-clear cell renal cancers, and for all tumours undergoing targeted therapy.

N2  - Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) occur in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndromes caused by germline alterations in MEN1 and VHL, respectively. It is thus expected that these genes will also be altered in a proportion of sporadic PETs. Indeed, MEN1 is altered in about 25% of nonfamilial PETs, although no mutations have been found in VHL. For all clinical subtypes, the frequency of allelic loss on chromosome arm 11q mirrors observed mutational frequencies, with the exception of nonfunctional tumors (NF-PETs), in which mutations have been reported in only 8% of cases. As allelic loss on 11q is the most frequent event found in these neoplasms, this low frequency is somewhat puzzling, particularly in light of the fact that most MEN1-associated PETs are nonfunctioning. To clarify the role of these genes in sporadic PETs, we analyzed 31 sporadic NF-PETs, nine insulinomas, and one VIPoma for alterations in MEN1 and VHL. As somatic mutations were observed in eight (26%) of the NF tumors and in one insulinoma, it would therefore appear unlikely that an additional tumor suppressor gene related to sporadic PET pathogenesis is located on 11q. One insulinoma also had a somatic mutation in VHL, and thus this gene may also be altered in these neoplasms, albeit in a small proportion of cases.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Making a specific diagnosis of pancreatic cysts preoperatively is difficult. The new disposable Moray micro forceps biopsy (MFB) device allows tissue sampling from the pancreatic cyst wall/septum and aims to improve diagnosis. This study compares the diagnostic performance of the MFB with the current conventional analysis of pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF).METHODS: A total of 48 patients sampled with MFB were identified. Cysts were classified as mucinous on PCF based on extracellular mucin/mucinous epithelium, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels >=192 ng/mL, or KRAS/GNAS mutation. A diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm was supported by GNAS mutation; a diagnosis of serous cystadenoma was supported by Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mutation. A diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm required the presence of subepithelial ovarian-type stroma. A high-risk cyst was defined as a mucinous cyst with high-grade dysplasia or an adenocarcinoma. Comparisons in diagnostic performance between PCF and MFB were made.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 69.6 years (range, 27-90 years); 25 of 48 patients (52.1%) were female. Cysts were in the pancreatic head (13 patients), neck (2 patients), body (20 patients), and tail (13 patients), averaging 3.1 cm (range, 1.2-6.0 cm). There was concordance with mucinous versus nonmucinous classification (60.4% for PCF vs 58.3% for MFB; P = .949). Three high-risk cysts were detected by PCF and 2 were detected by MFB (P = .670). However, MFB diagnosed significantly more specific cysts compared with PCF (50.0% for MFB vs 18.8% for PCF; P<.001).CONCLUSIONS: PCF analysis and MFB have comparable performance in distinguishing between mucinous and nonmucinous cysts and for detecting high-risk cysts. However, MFB was found to be superior for diagnosing specific cyst subtypes, thus adding significant value to preoperative patient management.

N2  - Almost 90 years ago the German biochemist Otto Warburg demonstrated that cancer cells metabolized glucose much more rapidly than did most normal somatic cells and that the primary product was lactic acid as opposed to CO<inf>2</inf> and water. Over the intervening years two factors that have been invoked to explain this metabolic shift from respiration to glycolysis by cancer cells have been hypoxia and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although hypoxia will indeed force cells to adopt glycolysis as a metabolic pathway, the Warburg effect is specifically defined as a shift to glycolysis as the primary pathway for glucose metabolism under normoxic conditions, i.e. aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that most cancer cells that utilize aerobic glycolysis have functional mitochondria. Despite this, there is at least one germline mutation, mutation to the VHL gene, that mimics hypoxia - pseudohypoxia - linked to two specific types of cancer, and there are three known germline mutations in the mitochondrial TCA cycle linked to cancer. This analysis will focus on the specific cancers that arise from these germline mutations in order to attempt to draw mechanistic conclusions from differences in these cancer types. The underlying assumption is that clear differences in cancer types stemming from these mutations require clear differences in etiology. Lastly the role of aerobic glycolysis, the Warburg effect, will be examined.

N2  - <b>Background:</b> Static single timeframe <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT is useful for the localization and functional characterization of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-uptake varies between PPGLs with different genotypes and highest standardized uptake values (SUVs) are observed in case of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations, possibly related to enhanced aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells. The exact determinants of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG accumulation in PPGL are unknown. We performed dynamic PET/CT scanning to assess in vivo <sup>18</sup>F-FDG pharmacokinetics to investigate whether it has added value over static PET to distinguish different genotypes. <b>Methods:</b> Dynamic <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT was performed in 13 sporadic PPGLs and 13 PPGLs from 11 patients with hereditary mutations in SDHA/B/D, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), RET and neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a two-tissue compartment tracer kinetic model. The derived transfer rate-constants for transmembranous glucose flux (K1 (in), k2 (out)) and intracellular phosphorylation (k3) along with the fractional blood volume (Vb) were analyzed using non-linear regression analysis. Glucose metabolic rate (MRglc) was calculated using Patlak linear regression analysis. Maximum SUVs (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of the lesions were determined on additional static PET/CT. <b>Results:</b> Both MRglc and SUV<sub>max</sub> for hereditary cluster 1 (SDHx, VHL) tumors were significantly higher than for hereditary cluster 2 (RET, NF1) (P<0.01) and sporadic tumors (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). Median k3 in cluster 1 was significantly higher than for sporadic tumors (P<0.01). Median Vb for cluster 1 was significantly higher than for cluster 2 tumors (P<0.01). No statistical significant differences in K1 and k2 were found between the groups. Cutoff values for k3 to distinguish between cluster 1 and other tumors were established at 0.015 min-1 (100% sensitivity, 15,8% specificity) and 0.636 min-1 (100% specificity, 85.7% sensitivity). MRglc significantly correlated with SUV<sub>max</sub> (P = 0.001) and k3 (P = 0.002). <b>Conclusion:</b> In vivo metabolic tumor profiling in patients with PPGL can be achieved by assessing <sup>18</sup>F-FDG pharmacokinetics using dynamic PET/CT scanning. Cluster 1 PPGLs can be reliably identified by a high <sup>18</sup>F-FDG phosphorylation rate.

N2  - Cancer-specific metabolic alterations are of high interest as therapeutic targets. These alterations vary between tumor types, and to employ metabolic targeting to its fullest potential there is a need for robust methods that identify candidate targetable metabolic pathways in individual cancers. Currently, such methods include <sup>13</sup>C-tracing studies and mass spectrometry/ magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Due to high cost and complexity, such studies are restricted to a research setting. We here present the validation of a novel technique of metabolic profiling, based on multiplex targeted next generation sequencing of RNA with single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), designed to measure activity of and mutations in genes that encode metabolic enzymes. We here profiled an isogenic pair of cell lines, differing in expression of the Von Hippel Lindau protein, an important regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes. We show that smMIP-profiling provides relevant information on active metabolic pathways. Because smMIP-based targeted RNAseq is cost-effective and can be applied in a medium high-throughput setting (200 samples can be profiled simultaneously in one next generation sequencing run) it is a highly interesting approach for profiling of the activity of genes of interest, including those regulating metabolism, in a routine patient care setting.

N2  - PURPOSE: Patients with hereditary forms of renal cancer are at risk for new tumors and metastases. Renal parenchymal sparing surgery has been performed to preserve renal function and quality of life, and prevent metastases. We evaluated a 3 cm. threshold for performing renal parenchymal sparing surgery in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and hereditary papillary renal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease or hereditary papillary renal cancer and renal cancer were identified by screening affected kindred and by kindred history. Patients with small tumors were followed with serial imaging studies until the largest renal tumor was 3 cm., when renal parenchymal sparing surgery was performed. Renal tumors greater than 3 cm. were resected without delay. Parenchymal sparing techniques were used when possible in each group. RESULTS: The 3 cm. surgical threshold was evaluated in 52 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (group 1) at a median followup of 60 months (range 6 to 205). None of these patients had metastatic disease and none has required renal transplantation or dialysis. In 44 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (group 2) renal tumors larger than 3 cm. developed. Median followup from the initial radiological diagnosis of renal cancer in this group was 66.5 months (range 0 to 321). Patients in group 1 underwent parenchymal sparing surgery instead of nephrectomy more frequently than those in group 2 (46 of 48 operations or 96% versus 45 of 72 or 63%, Fisher's exact test p <0.0001). In contrast to patients in group 1, metastatic renal cancer developed in 11 of the 44 in group 2 (25%) (Fisher's exact test p <0.0001). A total of 23 patients with hereditary papillary renal cancer were also identified. Median followup in these cases was 44 months (range 0 to 237). Ten patients had tumors less than 3 cm. No patient with tumors less than 3 cm. and 2 of the 13 (15%) with larger tumors had metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Using a 3 cm. renal tumor diameter as an indication for renal surgery no patient with renal cancer and von Hippel-Lindau disease or hereditary papillary renal cancer had metastatic disease regardless of the number of tumors. Using a lesion size of 3 cm. as a threshold for performing renal parenchymal sparing surgery may help to prevent metastatic disease, unnecessary renal damage due to frequent surgery and renal dialysis or transplantation.

N2  - Tumor suppressor proteins control the proliferation and survival of normal cells; consequently, their inactivation by gene mutations can initiate or drive cancer progression. Most tumor suppressors have been identified by genetic screening, and in many cases their function and regulation are poorly understood. Ten such proteins were recently shown to contain nuclear transport signals that facilitate their "shuttling" between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This type of dynamic intracellular movement not only regulates protein localization, but also often impacts on function. Here, we review the pathways by which tumor suppressors such as APC, p53, VHL, and BRCA1 cross the nuclear envelope and the impact of regulated nuclear import/export on protein function. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by near-universal loss of the short arm of chromosome 3, deleting several tumor suppressor genes. We analyzed whole genomes from 95 biopsies across 33 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We find hotspots of point mutations in the 5' UTR of TERT, targeting a MYC-MAX-MAD1 repressor associated with telomere lengthening. The most common structural abnormality generates simultaneous 3p loss and 5q gain (36% patients), typically through chromothripsis. This event occurs in childhood or adolescence, generally as the initiating event that precedes emergence of the tumor's most recent common ancestor by years to decades. Similar genomic changes drive inherited ccRCC. Modeling differences in age incidence between inherited and sporadic cancers suggests that the number of cells with 3p loss capable of initiating sporadic tumors is no more than a few hundred. Early development of ccRCC follows well-defined evolutionary trajectories, offering opportunity for early intervention. Combination of whole-genome sequencing analysis and a multi-region sampling approach provides insights into the nature and timing of key oncogenic events in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, depicts the evolutionary trajectories of tumors in patients and highlights the opportunity for early intervention.

N2  - Endolymphatic sac tumor (ELST) is a rare neoplasm arising in the temporal petrous region thought to originate from endolymphatic sac epithelium. It may arise sporadically or in association with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL). The ELST prevalence in VHL ranges from 3 to 16% and may be the initial presentation of the disease. Onset is usually in the 3rd to 5th decade with hearing loss and an indolent course. ELSTs present as locally destructive lesions with characteristic computed tomography imaging features. Histologically, they show papillary, cystic or glandular architectures. Immunohistochemically, they express keratin, EMA, and variably S100 and GFAP. Currently it is recommended that, given its rarity, ELST needs to be differentiated from other entities with similar morphologic patterns, particularly other VHL-associated neoplasms such as metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Nineteen ELST cases were studied. Immunohistochemistry (18/19) and single nucleotide polymorphism microarray testing was performed (12/19). Comparison with the immunophenotype and copy number profile in RCC is discussed. Patients presented with characteristic bone destructive lesions in the petrous temporal bones. Pathology of tumors showed characteristic ELST morphology with immunoexpression of CK7, GFAP, S100, PAX-8, PAX-2, CA-9 in the tumor cells. Immunostaines for RCC, CD10, CK20, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, thyroglobulin, and transthyretin were negative in the tumor cells. Molecular testing showed loss of 3p and 9q in 66% (8/12) and 58% (7/12) cases, respectively. Immunoreactivity for renal markers in ELST is an important diagnostic caveat and has not been previously reported. In fact, renal markers are currently recommended in order to rule out metastatic RCC although PAX gene complex and CA-9 have been implicated in the development of the inner ear. Importantly copy number assessment of ELST has not been previously reported. Loss of 3p (including the VHL locus) in ELST suggests similar mechanistic origins as ccRCC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene inactivation is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) development. The VHL protein (pVHL) has been proposed to regulate the expression of several proteins including Hypoxia Inducible Factor-alpha (HIF-alpha), carbonic anhydrase (CA)IX, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)A2/B1 and osteopontin. pVHL has been characterized in vitro, however, clinical studies are limited. We evaluated the impact of VHL genetic alterations on the expression of several pVHL protein targets in paired normal and tumor tissue. METHODS: The VHL gene was sequenced in 23 CCRCC patients and VHL transcript levels were evaluated by Real-Time RT-PCR. Expression of pVHL's protein targets were determined by Western blotting in 17 paired patient samples. RESULTS: VHL genetic alterations were identified in 43.5% (10/23) of CCRCCs. HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and CAIX were up-regulated in 88.2% (15/17), 100% (17/17) and 88.2% (15/17) of tumors respectively and their expression is independent of VHL status. hnRNP A2/B1 and osteopontin expression was variable in CCRCCs and had no association with VHL genetic status. CONCLUSION: As expression of these proposed pVHL targets can be achieved independently of VHL mutation (and possibly by hypoxia alone), this data suggests that other pVHL targets may be more crucial in renal carcinogenesis.

N2  - Renal oncocytosis is a rare condition in which the kidney develops numerous oncocytomas. We present a case of a 12-year-old female who presented with right-sided flank pain of one-year duration. Imaging revealed several masses in the right kidney. Tissue biopsy confirmed multiple benign oncocytomas. Due to the presence of multiple oncocytomas throughout the kidney, a radical nephrectomy was performed. Given the rarity of this condition, as well as its known association with von Hippel-Lindau disease and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, genetic investigations were pursued but failed to identify any abnormalities. This patient remains well and disease free six years after surgery. A review of the literature of this rare condition was performed. Copyright © 2015 The Authors.Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, leads to the up-regulation of genes involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose metabolism and is associated with tumor progression in several cancers. However, the contribution of HIF-1alpha versus HIF-2alpha to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and other HIF-regulated target genes under different conditions is unclear. To address this, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) techniques to knockdown HIF-1alpha and/or HIF-2alpha expression in response to hypoxia, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, or renal carcinoma cells expressing constitutively high basal levels of HIF-1alpha and/or HIF-2alpha due to loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) function. We found that HIF-1alpha primarily regulates transcriptional activation of VEGF in response to hypoxia and IGF-I compared with HIF-2alpha in MCF-7 cells. We also observed a reciprocal relationship between HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression in hypoxia in these cells: HIF-2alpha siRNA enhanced HIF-1alpha-mediated VEGF expression in MCF-7 cells in response to hypoxia, which could be completely blocked by cotransfection with HIF-1alpha siRNA. In contrast, in renal carcinoma cells that constitutively express HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha due to loss of VHL function, we found that high basal VEGF, glucose transporter-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression was predominantly dependent on HIF-2alpha. Finally, we showed that a newly identified small-molecule inhibitor of HIF-1, NSC-134754, is also able to significantly decrease HIF-2alpha protein expression and HIF-2alpha-regulated VEGF levels in renal carcinoma cells. Our data have important implications for how we target the HIF pathway therapeutically.

N2  - Background: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor is a major genetic factor that determines hypoxic acclimatization and response to therapy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Our initial studies revealed that 2'-Hydroxyflavanone (2HF) effectively inhibits the survival of VHL-mutant RCC. Hence, we performed proteomic analyses to study the signaling networks of clinical significance that are regulated by 2HF in VHL-mutant RCC. Methods: The 786-O cells, an established cell line from a male Caucasian patient, were provided by William Kaelin Jr., MD, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA USA. The cells were cultured either in the presence or absence of 50 muM 2HF for 48 h in RPMI medium at 37degreeC in 5% CO2 and lysed in a buffer containing 6M urea. The lysate (200 mug of protein) was reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin. Tryptic digests were desalted using a C-18 cartridge (Waters, USA) and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses on linear ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometer (LTQ-FT, Thermo) coupled to an Eksigent nano-LC system. MS/MS spectra were searched against human protein sequence database using Mascot (Matrix Science), and protein identifications were validated by Scaffold (version 3.0, Proteome Software). Quantifications were performed by extracted peptide intensities (Progenesis LC-MS, Nonlinear Dynamics). Results: 2HF treatment lead to up-regulation of 21 proteins including protein disulfide-isomerase A4 and macrophage migration inhibition factor. 2HF treatment lead to down-regulation of 23 proteins including vimentin, HSP90AB1, 14-3-3 gamma and glutaminase. The network analyses revealed that the identified proteins form critical nodes of regulation of vital tumor proteins like MAP3K14, ERK1/2, Myc and P53. Conclusions: Proteomic analyses of 2HF treated VHL-mutant RCC revealed a striking regulation of proteins of importance in RCC survival, invasion and metastases. The critical nodes of regulation as identified by the network analyses could facilitate further studies on the development of network targeting therapies using 2HF and other anti-cancer compounds for the effective management of VHL-mutant RCC.

N2  - Alterations of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene (VHL) on 3p25-p26 are frequent in clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). The VHL protein (pVHL) is implicated in cell-cycle control and gene regulation, and requires transcription-dependent nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking for its function. There are two biologically active VHL protein isoforms: pVHL(30) and pVHL(19). To study prevalence, subcellular expression and biological significance of pVHL in renal tumors, tissue microarrays with renal-cell carcinomas were immunohistochemically examined for pVHL expression. Antibodies against both protein isoforms (anti-pVHL(30)/pVHL(19)) and against pVHL(30) (anti-pVHL(30); Ig33) were used. The anti-pVHL(30)/pVHL(19) antibody showed nuclear and cytoplasmic pVHL expression, whereas the anti-pVHL(30) antibody (Ig33) detected cytoplasmic pVHL expression, suggesting that the distribution of VHL protein isoforms varies in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of renal tumors. There were 175 of 398 primary clear-cell RCCs (44%) with both nuclear and cytoplasmic pVHL expression. Seventy-seven clear-cell RCCs (19%) showed only nuclear, 22 (6%) showed only cytoplasmic, and 124 tumors (31%) showed no pVHL expression. Notably, combined nuclear and cytoplasmic pVHL expression was associated with low histological grade (P < 0.0001), early tumor stage (P < 0.01), and better prognosis (P < 0.01). These results imply that alteration of subcellular pVHL trafficking is of potential relevance for the biological behavior of clear-cell RCC.

N2  - Enthesis is the region where a tendon attaches to a bone. It is a relatively vulnerable position, and in most cases surgical treatment is required upon rupture. The reconstructed enthesis is usually weaker compared to the original, and is prone to rupture again. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) is known to be involved in extensive activities in cells. It is inhibited under normoxic conditions, and undergoes two essential processes, hydroxylation and ubiquitination, the latter of which has been largely unexplored. Herein, we measured the levels of HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha in VH298-treated rat tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) by immunoblotting. We also detected the proliferation of TDSCs using CCK-8 assay and the mRNA levels of related genes by quantitative RT-PCR. The TDSCs were observed to be induced and the chondrogenic differentiation related genes were found to be enhanced. We also simulated in-vitro wounding in a scratch test and reconstructed the enthesis in a rat model of Achilles tendon by classical surgery followed by administration of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection or VH298 injection. We observed that HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha levels were increased in VH298-treated TDSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Thirty micromolar VH298 could significantly increase cell proliferation, migration, and expression of collagen-1alpha, collagen-3alpha, decorin, tenomodulin, tenascin C genes, and chondrogenic differentiation-related genes, collagen-2alpha, SRY-box9, aggrecan. VH298-treated enthesis could tolerate more load-to-failure, had a better healing pattern, and activation of HIF signaling pathway. VH298 can thus enhance the functional activities of TDSCs, enhance their chondrogenic differentiation potential, and accelerate enthesis healing by inhibiting the ubiquitination of hydroxy-HIF-1alpha.

N2  - ZAC/PLAGL1 is a novel imprinted tumor suppressor gene encoding an important inducer of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and found to be lost during tumorigenesis. We analyzed the significance of ZAC in the development of a rare, usually benign tumor of the adrenal gland: pheochromocytoma (PCC). Twenty-four PCCs were analyzed for the loss of the active nonimprinted allele of ZAC, and nine of the twenty-four PCCs were also assayed for expression of the protein. In thirteen of the cases, a paired nonmalignant tissue was available for analysis. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed frequent (15 of 23, 65%) loss of unmethylated DNA in the imprinting control region of ZAC. Immunohistochemistry identified reduced ZAC expression in 56% (5 of 9) of the subset cases. Four of the five PCC cases where reduced expression of ZAC was observed were also positive for the loss of the active ZAC allele. Additionally, the loss of ZAC expression was also found to be frequent in a series of capillary hemangioblastomas and gliomas (6 of 6, 100%, and 17 of 27, 63%, respectively) examined for comparison. In conclusion, our study suggests the involvement of the imprinted ZAC gene in the pathogenesis of PCC.

N2  - Purpose: This phase II study evaluated the activity of combined treatment with interferon alfa-2b and sorafenib, a Raf and multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced renal carcinoma. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had metastatic or unresectable renal carcinoma with a clear-cell component, no prior systemic therapy, performance status 0 to 1, and measurable disease. Treatment consisted of interferon alfa-2b 10 x 10<sup>6</sup> U subcutaneously three times weekly and sorafenib 400 mg orally bid. The primary end point was confirmed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response rate. Results: Twelve (19%) of 62 assessable patients achieved an objective confirmed response. An additional 31 (50%) had an unconfirmed partial response or stable disease as best response. The median progression-free survival was 7 months (95% CI, 4 to 11 months). The most common adverse events were fatigue, anorexia, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, rigors/chills, leukopenia, fever, and transaminase elevation. Von Hippel-Lindau gene mutations were detected in four (22%) of 18 archival tumor specimens. Conclusion: The confirmed response rate for the combination of sorafenib and interferon in advanced renal carcinoma is greater than expected with either interferon or sorafenib alone. The toxicity of this combination is dominated by adverse events common to interferon that limit further development of this regimen. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  - Recently, proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology is highlighted in drug discovery area as a new therapeutic approach. PROTAC as a heterobifunctional molecule is comprised of two ligands, which recruit target protein and E3 ligase, respectively. To degrade the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein, such as NPM-ALK or EML4-ALK, we generated several ALK-PROTAC molecules consisted of ceritinib, one of the ALK inhibitors, and ligand of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase. Among these molecules, TD-004 effectively induced ALK degradation and inhibited the growth of ALK fusion positive cell lines, SU-DHL-1 and H3122. We also confirmed that TD-004 significantly reduced the tumor growth in H3122 xenograft model.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of renal cancer in adults. RCC is notoriously resistant to current therapies suggesting the need to improve our knowledge and create more effective therapies. The molecular genetic defects that occur in RCC are extensive and complex ranging from single DNA changes, to large chromosomal defects, to signature disruptions in the transcription of hundreds of genes. These changes are often shared within each histological RCC subtype, illustrating their significance to the disease phenotype. This review presents an overview of the genetic abnormalities that occur within the most common subtypes of RCC. We discuss the recent molecular findings that have advanced our understanding of the somatic architecture of renal tumors and their impact on disease therapeutics. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

N2  - Renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are frequent in central and eastern Europe and the reasons remain unclear. Molecular mechanisms, except for VHL, have not been much investigated. We analysed 361 RCCs (334 clear-cell carcinomas) from a multi-centre case-control study for mutations in TP53 (exons 5-9 in the whole series and exons 4 and 10 in a pilot subset of 60 tumours) and a pilot 50 tumours for mutations in EGFR (exons 18-21) or KRAS (codon 12) in relation to VHL status. TP53 mutations were detected in 4% of clear-cell cases, independently of VHL mutations. In non-clear-cell carcinomas, they were detected in 11% of VHL-wild-type tumours and in 0% of tumours with VHL functional mutations. No mutations were found in EGFR or KRAS. We conclude that mutations in TP53, KRAS, or EGFR are not major contributors to the RCC development even in the absence of VHL inactivation. The prevalence of TP53 mutations in relation to VHL status may differ between clear-cell and other renal carcinomas. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) frequently occurs in patients with long-term dialysis. Long-term dialysis causes distinctive pathological changes in the kidney, which is known as acquired cystic disease of the kidney (ACDK). It is of great interest to know whether RCCs occurring in the dialytic kidneys harbour the same or similar mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene as conventional dialysis-unrelated clear cell RCCs so often do. METHODS: Renal cancer tissues (eight clear cell, two papillary, one Bellini duct and three of the so-called dialysis-specific renal carcinomas) from 13 patients undergoing long-term dialysis were examined for somatic mutations of the VHL disease gene. By means of laser capture microdissection, cancerous and surrounding non-cancerous renal tissues from dialytic patients were subjected to PCR-based direct sequencing of the VHL gene. RESULTS: Direct forward and reverse sequencing showed that three tumours possessed VHL gene mutations (713delG, 500-504del5-bp and 709A>G). These three mutations were identified in clear cell carcinomas occurring in association with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis for 194, 147 and 125 months. None of the non-tumour tissues or other carcinoma tissues analysed, including dialysis-specific carcinoma, possessed VHL gene mutations. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that VHL tumour-suppressor gene mutation is involved in clear cell carcinoma in association with long-term dialysis. Mutation of the VHL gene was not found in any of the dialysis-specific RCCs studied herein.

N2  - Alterations in DNA methylation are seen in cancers and have also been examined in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Numerous tumor suppressor genes have been reported to be partially or completely silenced due to hypermethylation of their promoters in single-locus studies, and the use of hypomethylating agents has been shown to restore the expression of many of these genes in vitro. In particular, members of the Wnt and TGF-beta pathways, pro-apoptotic genes such as APAF-1 and negative cell-cycle regulators such as KILLIN have been shown to be epigenetically silenced in numerous studies in ccRCC. Recently, TCGA analysis of a large cohort of ccRCC samples demonstrated that aberrant hypermethylation correlated with the stage and grade in kidney cancer. Our genome-wide studies also revealed aberrant widespread hypermethylation that affected regulatory regions of the kidney genome in ccRCC. We also observed that aberrant enhancer hypermethylation was predictive of adverse prognosis in ccRCC. Recent discovery of mutations affecting epigenetic regulators reinforces the importance of these changes in the pathophysiology of ccRCC and points to the potential of epigenetic modulators in the treatment of this malignancy.

N2  - Translocation-type renal carcinoma has been recently discovered, and it is possible that this tumor may have been previously diagnosed as other types of renal tumor. We have subjected 41 renal tumors, including VHL gene mutation-negative clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), papillary RCC, and chromophobe RCC, to immunohistochemistry of transcription factor E3 (TFE3) and TFEB. All tumors were histologically evaluated by additional immunohistochemical study. As a result, 5 tumors showed a positive reaction for TFE3 with a range from 1+ to 2+ in intensity. No tumors were positive for TFEB. In 5 tumors immunohistochemically positive for TFE3, chimeric transcripts including ASPL-TFE3, PRCC-TFE3, CLTCTFE3, PSF-TFE3, or Nono-TFE3 were not detected. The diagnosis of 6 tumors was changed by reevaluation through retrospective histological and immunohistochemical study. In 4 of 6 tumors, the diagnosis of clear cell RCC was changed to chromophobe RCC. In 1 tumor, oncocytoma was detectable, and RCC with rhabdoid features and sarcomatoid changes was detected in 1 tumor. Finally, the cutoff value of TFE3 immunohistochemistry should be more than 2+ with a wide range. The translocation-type renal carcinoma seems to be quite rare.

N2  - Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 3 are often observed in a specific subset of aggressive neuroblastomas (NBs) with loss of distal 11q and without MYCN amplification. The critical deleted region encompasses the locus of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL, 3p25). Constitutional loss of function mutations in the VHL gene are responsible for the VHL syndrome, a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of neoplasms, including pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are, like NB, derived from neural crest cells, but, unlike NB, consist of more mature chromaffin cells instead of immature neuroblasts. Further arguments for a putative role of VHL in NB are its function as oxygen sensitizer and the reported relation between hypoxia and dedifferentiation of NB cells, leading to a more aggressive phenotype. To test the possible involvement of VHL in NB, we did mRNA expression analysis and sought evidence for VHL gene inactivation. Although no evidence for a classic tumor suppressor role for VHL in NB could be obtained, a strong correlation was observed between reduced levels of VHL mRNA and low patient survival probability (p=0.013). Furthermore, VHL appears to have predictive power in NTRK1 (TRKA) positive tumor samples with presumed favorable prognosis, which makes it a potentially valuable marker for more accurate risk assessment in this subgroup of patients. The significance of the reduced VHL expression levels in relation to NB tumor biology remains unexplained, as functional analysis demonstrated no clear effect of the reduction in VHL mRNA expression on protein stability of its downstream target hypoxia-inducible factor alpha.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) is a major tumor suppressor protein and also associated with the inhibition of angiogenesis via HIF-1alpha ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To further elucidate the biological activity of pVHL in angiogenesis, pVHL-interacting proteins were screened using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that a mouse homologue of the long form of Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid, Tid-1(L), directly interacts with pVHL in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Tid-1(L) protein; enhanced the interaction between HIF-1alpha and pVHL, leading to the destabilization of HIF-1alpha protein; therefore, Tid-1(L) protein decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression and inhibited angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. These findings propose that Tid-1(L) may play a critical role in pVHL-mediated tumor suppression by modulating the pVHL-dependent HIF-1alpha stability.

N2  - Attempts to predict outcome in patients with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have conventionally been based on pretherapy clinical factors such as performance status, disease-free interval, number of metastatic sites and several laboratory variables. These factors were developed before the era of VEGF-targeted therapy. Recent analysis from trials with anti-VEGF agents indicate that these factors continue to be of major importance in patient prognostication. Additionally, several serum and molecular markers, many of which relate to certain alterations of the von Hippel-Lindau pathway, are currently being investigated. Responses to VEGF-targeted agents appear to be related to a greater modulation of serum VEGF and soluble VEGF receptor levels. The impact of von Hippel-Lindau gene status on response to VEGF-targeted therapy was tested in a large study and was not found to predict a higher response rate to these agents. However, a subset of von Hippel-Lindau mutations that predict a 'loss of function' of the von Hippel-Lindau gene seem to have the best response to these agents. Future prognostic models will incorporate molecular markers with clinical variables to refine prognosis and prediction in metastatic clear-cell RCC patients treated with novel VEGF-targeted agents. These models, if externally and prospectively validated, will culminate in the rational selection of patients for specific VEGF-directed therapeutics. [References: 59]

N2  - Functional inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is the cause of the familial VHL disease and most sporadic renal clear-cell carcinomas (RCC). pVHL has been shown to play a role in the destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) subunits via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and in the regulation of fibronectin matrix assembly. Although most disease-causing pVHL mutations hinder the regulation of the HIF pathway, every disease-causing pVHL mutant tested to date has failed to promote the assembly of the fibronectin matrix, underscoring its potential importance in VHL disease. Here, we report that a ubiquitin-like molecule called NEDD8 covalently modifies pVHL. A nonneddylateable pVHL mutant, while retaining its ability to ubiquitylate HIF, failed to bind to and promote the assembly of the fibronectin matrix. Expression of the neddylation-defective pVHL in RCC cells, while restoring the regulation of HIF, failed to promote the differentiated morphology in a three-dimensional growth assay and was insufficient to suppress the formation of tumors in SCID mice. These results suggest that NEDD8 modification of pVHL plays an important role in fibronectin matrix assembly and that in the absence of such regulation, an intact HIF pathway is insufficient to prevent VHL-associated tumorigenesis.

N2  - Renal cell cancer (RCC) has an increasing incidence internationally and is a disease for which there have been limited therapeutic options until recently. The last decade has seen a vastly improved understanding of the biological and clinical factors that predict the outcome of this disease. We now understand some of the different molecular underpinnings of renal clear cell carcinoma by mutation or silencing of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene and subsequent deregulated proliferation and angiogenesis. Survival in advanced disease is predicted by factors (performance status, anemia, hypercalcemia, and serum lactate dehydrogenase, time from diagnosis to recurrence) incorporated into the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria (also referred to as 'Motzer' criteria). These criteria allow classification of patients with RCC into good, intermediate and poor risk categories with median overall survivals of 22 months, 12 months and 5.4 months, respectively. Predicated upon these advances, six new targeted drugs (sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, everolimus, bevacizumab and pazopanib) have been tested in well-designed phase III trials, selected or stratified for MSKCC risk criteria, with positive results. All of these new drugs act at least in part through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mediated pathways with other potential therapeutic impact on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), raf kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Importantly, data from each of these trials show a consistent doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) over prior standard of care treatments. In addition, sorafenib, sunitinib and temsirolimus, have demonstrated significant overall survival (OS) benefits as well; further follow-up is required to determine whether the disease control exhibited by everolimus and pazopanib will translate into a survival advantage. These drugs are generally well tolerated, as demonstrated by quality-of-life improvement in clinical trials, and result in clinical benefit for in excess of 70% of patients treated. They have challenged the traditional outcomes of clinical trial design by achieving their benefits with relatively few radiographic responses, but high rates of disease stability. The unique side-effect profile coupled with the chronicity of therapy requires increased vigilance to maximize exposure to the drugs while maintaining quality of life and minimizing toxicity. This review focuses on the background, clinical development and practical use of these new drugs in RCC.

N2  - Endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs) are rare, slowly growing temporal bone neoplasms which show a high association with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. The immunohistochemistry evaluation of these papillary-cystic neoplasms frequently raises the differential diagnosis with renal cell carcinoma, among other metastatic neoplasms, whether in VHL patients or not. A cohort of 26 patients with ELSTs were evaluated for histologic features, immunohistochemistry findings, and association with VHL. Standard immunohistochemistry evaluation was performed. Sixteen females and 10 males ranging in age from 10 to 69 years (mean 44; VHL mean: 32) at initial presentation, comprised the cohort of patients. Most (86%) experienced hearing changes or inner ear symptoms (vertigo, dizziness), with an average duration of symptoms for 39 months (range 2-240 months). The tumors were an average of 2.9 cm (range 0.4-8 cm), with 14 left, 11 right sided and one bilateral tumor. Nine patients had documented VHL, with 3 patients having a concurrent or subsequent clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Patients were followed an average of 6.2 years (available in 24 patients): 19 alive without disease, 7.5 years; 2 dead without disease, 1.2 years; and 3 alive with disease, 3.1 years. The neoplastic cells show the following immunohistochemistry findings: AE1/AE3, EMA, CK7, CAIX, GLUT1, VEGF: 100% of cases tested were positive; pax-8: 85% of cases positive; CD10 and RCC: 0% of cases reactive. Based on this cohort of 26 patients with ELST, 9 of whom had VHL, the strong pax-8 and CAIX should be used in conjunction with negative CD10 and RCC to help exclude a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. As CAIX is an enzyme overexpressed in hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factor is what VHL protein regulates, this is an expected, although previously unreported finding. Whether part of VHL or not, VHL mutations may be a somatic rather than germline finding in the tumors, a possible further explanation for the CAIX reaction.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate associations between computed tomographic (CT) features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, or BAP1 genes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective, hypothesis-generating study of 233 patients with clear cell RCC and waived the informed consent requirement. The study was HIPAA compliant. Three radiologists independently reviewed pretreatment CT images of all clear cell RCCs without knowledge of their genomic profile. One radiologist measured largest diameter and enhancement parameters of each clear cell RCC. Associations between CT features and mutations in VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 genes were tested by using the Fisher exact test. Associations between mutations and size and enhancement were assessed by using the independent t test. Interreader agreement was calculated by using the Fleiss kappa. RESULTS: Mutation frequencies among clear cell RCCs were as follows: VHL, 53.2% (124 of 233); PBRM1, 28.8% (67 of 233); SETD2, 7.3% (17 of 233); KDM5C, 6.9% (16 of 233); and BAP1, 6.0% (14 of 233). Mutations of VHL were significantly associated with well-defined tumor margins (P = .013), nodular tumor enhancement (P = .021), and gross appearance of intratumoral vascularity (P = .018). Mutations of KDM5C and BAP1 were significantly associated with evidence of renal vein invasion (P = .022 and .046, respectively). The genotype of solid clear cell RCC differed significantly from the genotype of multicystic clear cell RCC. While mutations of SETD2, KDM5C, and BAP1 were absent in multicystic clear cell RCC, mutations of VHL (P = .016) and PBRM1 (P = .017) were significantly more common among solid clear cell RCC. Interreader agreement for CT feature assessments ranged from substantial to excellent (kappa = 0.791-0.912). CONCLUSION: This preliminary radiogenomics analysis of clear cell RCC revealed associations between CT features and underlying mutations that warrant further investigation and validation.

N2  - Background: Targeted therapies have shown profound effects on the outcome of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the optimal treatment for RCC of non-clear cell histology (nccRCC)-typically excluded from trials of targeted agents-remains uncertain. Materials and methods: By carrying out extensive searches of PubMed and ASCO databases, we identified and summarised research into the biological characteristics, clinical behaviour and treatment of different histological subtypes of nccRCC, focusing on targeted therapy. Results: The available data suggest that treatments currently approved for RCC are active in ncc subtypes, although the overall clinical benefit may be less than for clear cell RCC. Temsirolimus has proven benefit over interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) in patients with nccRCC, based on phase III data, while everolimus, sunitinib and sorafenib have all demonstrated some degree of activity in nccRCC in expanded-access trials. No clear picture has emerged of whether individual histological subtypes are particularly responsive to any individual treatment. Conclusions: Further molecular studies into the pathogenesis of RCC histological subtypes will help direct the development of novel, appropriate targeted agents. Clinical trials specifically designed to evaluate the role of targeted agents in nccRCC are ongoing, and data from trials with sunitinib and everolimus will be reported soon. © The Author 2013.

N1  - A literature review
N2  - PURPOSE:: Up to 16% of patients with the hereditary von Hippel-Lindau disease develop endolymphatic sac tumors of the inner ear. Early diagnosis and treatment of endolymphatic sac tumors can prevent audiovestibular morbidity, but optimal endolymphatic sac tumor surveillance strategy has yet to be determined. We aimed to evaluate endolymphatic sac tumor surveillance to determine the best surveillance strategy. METHODS:: In a national prospective study, 40 VHL mutation carriers were interviewed about audiovestibular symptoms and had audiological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging of the inner ear. Further, we performed a meta-analysis including all reported endolymphatic sac tumor von Hippel-Lindau disease cases in the literature (N = 140 with 156 endolymphatic sac tumors). RESULTS:: In the prospective study, endolymphatic sac tumors were suspected based on audiovestibular symptoms, audiometry, and magnetic resonance imaging in 34%, 30%, and 12.5% of subjects, respectively. In total, more than 90% of radiologically diagnosed endolymphatic sac tumors were associated with abnormal audiometric findings. No endolymphatic sac tumor genotype-phenotype correlations were found. CONCLUSION:: We recommend annual audiometry as a first-line endolymphatic sac tumor screening tool, and in countries where periodic surveillance magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system is performed, specific images of the inner ear should be included. Audiometric abnormalities in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease without magnetic resonance imaging-visible endolymphatic sac tumors could be due to microscopic endolymphatic sac tumors. Determination of audiometric endolymphatic sac tumor characteristics could further target screening and improve endolymphatic sac tumor diagnosis. Copyright © American Collage of Medical Genetics.

N2  - Endocrine surgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion when patients are diagnosed with clinical signs or symptoms of parathyroid carcinoma. Although rare, the best chance for cure of these patients is at the time of the initial operation. Surgical resection of recurrent disease can provide effective palliation and can sometimes be assisted using gamma-probe directed dissection of sestamibi-labeled tumor tissue. Treatment of hyperparathyroidism in the setting of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), particularly in the reoperative setting, can be aided by using the rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay to judge the adequacy of parathyroid debulking. In addition, in selected cases, the gamma probe can assist in identifying the location of ectopic or autografted sestamibi-labeled parathyroid tissue. Patients with incidental adrenal masses rarely require fine needle aspiration to exclude metastatic cancer. Fine needle aspiration, if performed, should never precede hormone evaluation to exclude pheochromocytoma. Patients who are diagnosed with incidental adrenal masses in the setting of a prior or concurrent cancer diagnosis are equally likely to have a primary adrenal mass as they would be to have metastatic cancer in the adrenal gland. Pheochromocytomas occasionally develop in patients with MEN-1. In suspicious cases, molecular identification of an MEN-1 mutation can be used to cogfirm the diagnosis. Preoperative hormone evaluation of a patient with an adrenal incidentaloma should include evaluation for subclinical Cushing's syndrome through an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test. Identification of this condition allows for safe peri- and postoperative steroid hormone replacement, with very slow withdrawal of exogenous steroids to allow the opposite adrenal gland to recover and avoid postoperative Addisonian crisis. Paragangliomas are more commonly multifocal and malignant compared to pheochromocytomas. Evaluation of patients with paragangliomas should include radiographic staging for multifocality and metastatic disease, and postoperative hormone and radiographic follow-up evaluation should be performed. Consideration should be given to genetic testing for von Hippel-Lindau and succinate dehydrogenase mutations. Surgical treatment of rare functioning pancreatic and duodenal endocrine tumors, such as metastatic sporadic insulinoma and MEN-1-associated gastrinoma, can provide effective palliation. Surgical treatment should be integrated into a comprehensive treatment scheme that recognizes the natural history of the disease and incorporates appropriate adjunctive therapies and follow-up strategies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that presents with a variable constellation of symptoms and signs due to formation of hemangioblastomas and cysts. We address the management of pregnancies associated with this disorder from an obstetric perspective. CASE: A 26-year-old known to have type 2A von Hippel-Lindau disease with a significant surgical history secondary to disease manifestations was managed from early pregnancy to delivery. A literature review to determine the best evidence-based care from an obstetric perspective, addressing patient management preconceptionally, in the antepartum period (including antepartum surgical care), during labor and delivery (including type of analgesia/anesthesia,mode of delivery), and the postpartum period, as well as contraception, was performed. CONCLUSIONS: A pregnant woman with von Hippel-Lindau disease should be managed in conjunction with a multidisciplinary team. Routine clinical and radiological imaging should be continued within safe parameters of pregnancy. Mode of delivery, analgesia/anesthesia, and postpartum care (including birth control) should be determined based on each patient's disease phenotype and individual risk-to-benefit ratio on a case-by-case basis.

N2  - Mass spectrometry analysis of renal cancer cell lines recently suggested that the protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ), an important regulator of tyrosine kinase receptors, is tightly linked to the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). Therefore, we aimed to characterize the biological relevance of PTPRJ for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In pVHL-negative ccRCC cell lines, both RNA and protein expression levels of PTPRJ were lower than those in the corresponding pVHL reconstituted cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis of ccRCC with known VHL mutation status and normal matched tissues as well as RNA in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray (TMA) confirmed a decrease of PTPRJ expression in more than 80% of ccRCCs, but in only 12% of papillary RCCs. ccRCC patients with no or reduced PTPRJ mRNA expression had a less favourable outcome than those with a normal expression status (p = 0.05). Sequence analysis of 32 PTPRJ mRNA-negative ccRCC samples showed five known polymorphisms but no mutations, implying other mechanisms leading to PTPRJ's down-regulation. Selective silencing of HIF-alpha by siRNA and reporter gene assays demonstrated that pVHL inactivation reduces PTPRJ expression through a HIF-dependent mechanism, which is mainly driven by HIF-2alpha stabilization. Our results suggest PTPRJ as a member of a pVHL-controlled pathway whose suppression by HIF is critical for ccRCC development.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not a single entity, rather it is a term defining a group of histologically distinct tumors arising in the renal parenchyma. Each histologic subtype is clinically and genetically unique. It is our understanding of the genetic basis for these cancers that has led to the variety of targeted systemic therapies now available in RCC. This review will cover the basic tumor biology behind each histology, as well as the associated therapeutic targets identified thus far. Mechanisms and associated side effects of the currently available drugs will be examined. Completed clinical trials will be discussed, leading into the rationale behind currently active trials, and future directions for drug development. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

N2  - The past two decades have witnessed recognition of several new types of renal cell carcinoma, each with distinct cytogenetic abnormalities. Included are several genetic and acquired cystic kidney diseases associated with development of renal cell carcinoma, the topic of this review. The risk in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is not accurately known but may be slightly increased. The risk for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease is substantial, and death from renal cancer is common. For patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, the challenge is recognition of the occasional malignancy arising in a field of many benign tumors. Patients with end-stage kidney disease and acquired cystic kidney disease may develop a variety of renal cell carcinoma types. Progress in understanding the molecular basis of renal cyst formation and neoplastic disease has fostered development of targeted therapies that now hold promise for a group of neoplasms whose cure was traditionally dependent on surgical approaches.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are critical transcription factors that mediate cell survival during reduced oxygen conditions (hypoxia). At regular oxygen conditions (normoxia), HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are continuously synthesized in cells and degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. During hypoxia, these proteins are stabilized and translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes that enable cell survival at reduced oxygen levels. HIF proteins are tightly regulated via post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, prolyl-hydroxylation and ubiquitination. Here we show for the first time that exogenous and endogenous HIF-2alpha are also regulated via the ubiquitin-like modifier small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO). Using mutational analysis, we found that K394, which is situated in the sumoylation consensus site LKEE, is the major SUMO acceptor site in HIF-2alpha. Functionally, sumoylation reduced the transcriptional activity of HIF-2alpha. Similar to HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha is regulated by the SUMO protease SENP1. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 strongly stabilized SUMO-2-conjugated HIF-2alpha during hypoxia but did not affect the total level of HIF-2alpha. The ubiquitin E3 ligases von Hippel-Lindau and RNF4 control the levels of sumoylated HIF-2alpha, indicating that sumoylated HIF-2alpha is degraded via SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases.

N2  - Abstract Background Brain metastases (BM) are a life-threatening complication. We aimed to analyse gene mutations in lung adenocarcinoma BM. Methods We performed next generation sequencing (NGS) of a pre-defined set of 48 cancer-related genes in a cohort of 76 neurosurgical lung adenocarcinoma BM specimens using a cancer specific gene panel on the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). NGS results were statistically correlated to patient characteristics. Data on ALK, ROS1, MET and FGFR1 gene status assessed by FISH were available from previous studies in the majority of patients. Results Twenty-nine (60.4%) of the 48 investigated cancer-related genes were mutated in at least one BM sample and 64 (84.2%) of the 76 BM samples carried at least one mutated gene. The number of mutated genes per sample ranged from 0 to 9 (median 2). The most commonly mutated genes were TP53, KRAS and CDKN2A, which were affected in 35/76 (46.1%), 29/76 (38.2%) and 17/76 (22.4%) samples, respectively. Other potentially druggable alterations included EGFR mutations (3/76, 3.9% of samples), PIK3CA mutation (2/76, 2.6%), BRAF mutation (1/76, 1.3%) and SMO mutation (1/76, 1.3%). Presence of KRAS mutations was associated with positive smoking history (p = 0.015, Chi square test) and presence of EGFR mutation correlated with unfavourable overall survival time from BM diagnosis (p = 0.019, log rank test). Conclusions Deleterious gene mutations, some of them with potential therapeutic implications, are found in a high fraction of lung adenocarcinoma BM. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains refractory to therapies. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor is involved in cell growth, cell motility, and vascularization. We evaluated whether targeting NF-kappaB could be of therapeutic and prognostic values in human RCC. The activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in human RCC cells and tumors was investigated by Western blot. In vitro, the effects of BAY 11-7085 and sulfasalazine, two NF-kappaB inhibitors, on tumor cell growth were investigated by cell counting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Their specificity toward NF-kappaB was analyzed by Western blot, confocal microscopy, NF-kappaB small interfering RNA, and NF-kappaB transcription assay. In vivo, the effects of BAY 11-7085 on the growth of human RCC tumors were investigated in nude mice. A tissue microarray (TMA) containing 241 cases of human RCC with 12 to 22 years of clinical follow-up and corresponding normal tissues was built up to assess prognostic significance of activated NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in cultured cells expressing or not the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene as a consequence of Akt kinase activation and in tumors. In vitro and in vivo NF-kappaB inhibition blocked tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis. On the TMA, NF-kappaB activation was correlated with tumor dimension but was not found to be an independent prognostic factor for patient survival. This report provides strong evidence that the mechanisms responsible for the intrinsic resistance of RCC cells to apoptosis converge on NF-kappaB independently of VHL expression and that targeting this pathway has great anticancer potential.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the principal transcription factor that regulates adaptive physiologic responses to compromised oxygen tension. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor protein binds and ubiquitylates the catalytic alpha subunit of HIF in an oxygen-dependent manner for rapid destruction via the 26S proteasome, thereby establishing VHL as a critical negative regulator of HIF. Mutations in VHL cause VHL disease, which is frequently characterized by the overexpression of HIFalpha and the development of tumors in multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system and the kidney. Here, we describe classical experimental approaches to demonstrate and validate HIF-responsive transcriptional regulation of genes.

N2  - We report about a case of a 22-year-old women who was admitted because of sudden and painless proximal paraparesis, sensory loss at distal L 1, and bladder dysfunction. In MRI, cystic lesions in the spinal cord were identified at C 1, C 6, T 1, T 6, and T 11 as well as in the cerebellum. A tentative diagnosis of spinal hemangioblastomas was confirmed by spinal angiography and postoperative histology of the symptomatic tumor at T11. Furthermore, retinal hemangioblastomas were detected by fluorescence angiography and treated with laser surgery. Based on the clinical findings, we assumed the diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (vHL). Postoperatively, the paraparesis and sensory deficit improved, but the bladder dysfunction persisted. The patient's identical twin was screened for hemangioblastomas, too, and spinal, retinal, and one cerebellar tumor with a nearly identical location pattern were found. There was no evidence for pancreatic, adrenal, or renal involvement in both twins. The twins were investigated for inactivating mechanisms of the vHL germline mutations using single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and Southern blotting, but none of the known germline mutations were identified. Because the family history is devoid of vHL disease, spontaneous mutation might be causal for the syndrome in our patients.

N2  - Choking cancer via inhibition of metabolic enzymes essential for tumor but dispensable in normal tissues was discussed as was the altered metabolism in cancer cells related to: tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) function, the histone acetylation dependence upon glucose, the epigenomic reprogramming of acetyl CoA synthesis, the plasticity of aging mechanisms, and the metabolism orchestration in macrophage polarization. The p53 and p73 pathways role in metabolic adaptation, the effects on growth of AMP-dependent kinase, the growth regulation by the mTOR pathways, and the bioenergetics requirements of cancer cells were also discussed. A novel computational model of personalized metabolic changes in cancer was outlined with applications in patients with breast cancer. Imaging metabolic characteristics of tumors by MRI and C-nuclear magnetic resonance was described. The cancer metabolism regulation related to O-linked P-N-acetylglucosame was described. DNA hypermethylation and impaired hematopoietic differentiation in AML after isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutation and 2-hydroxyglutarate increases were outlined. © 2013 AACR.

N2  - With the recent advances in targeted therapies, biomarkers in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) continue to be developed. Historically, information regarding prognosis has come from clinicopathologic variables, however in recent years much research has focused on the molecular basis of renal cell cancer. The discovery of reliable biomarkers in RCC could have an important impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapeutic benefit. To date, most biomarker research has centered on byproducts of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) pathway including VHL mutations, vascular endothelial growth factor (ligands and receptors), hypoxia-inducible factor, and carbonic anhydrase IX. This review examines these potential biomarkers, biomarker prognostic models, and molecular expression profiles in the field of renal cell carcinoma. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

N2  - The majority of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are characterized by loss of function of the tumor suppressor gene von Hippel Lindau (VHL), which acts as ubiquitin ligase for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). In the absence of VHL, HIF-1alpha protein becomes stabilized and contributes to tumorigenesis. Recent data demonstrate the antitumor efficacy of VHL promoter in RCC cells. This study demonstrates that N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) is a potential regulator of VHL. NDRG2 is involved in proliferation and invasion of cancer cell, furthermore it is frequently down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma. Herein we evaluated the effect of NDRG2 overexpression on proliferation and invasion in human renal cancer cells. The human renal cancer cell line 786-O and A498 were infected with Ad-NDRG2 or Ad-LacZ. Overexpression of NDRG2 not only inhibited the growth of the cells, but also suppressed the invasion. Further study showed that the tumor suppressor gene VHL were up-regulated, whereas transcription factor HIF-1a and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were down-regulated in 786-O cells infected by Ad-NDRG2. Finally, in a nude mouse model, intratumoral injections of Ad-NDRG2 every 3 days for a total of seven times significantly inhibited the growth and angiogenesis of xenografted 786-O tumors. In conclusion, these data indicate that NDRG2 may be involved in proliferation and invasion by impacting the expression of VHL and HIF-1alpha. NDRG2 may be an attractive therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the features and treatment of renal lesions in von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) from a series of patients, to highlight important issues in the management of these lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study in 7 patients with VHL who underwent surgery for renal lesions between January 1990 and July 1996. The initial evaluation consisted of an abdominal CT scan and renal arteriography. RESULTS: The mean age of patients at the time of discovery was 38 (+/- 12.01 years). All cases were of type 1. Radiology assessment underestimated the gravity of the lesions in 5 patients. In all patients, unilateral surgery was performed with the kidney being conserved in 4 cases. Of the 44 lesions removed, 23 had signs of progressiveness (atypical or malignant cyst, renal cell carcinoma), most of the cancers were of low grade. 84% of the lesions did not exceed 3 cm and 48% were </=1 cm. During follow-up (42 months), 2 patients relapsed. CONCLUSION: The clinical and pathological features of renal lesions in VHL require strict and early follow-up (from the age of 15). Only under these circumstances should primary conservative surgery be performed, however, recurrences are frequent. This conservative approach remains to be validated by multicentric prospective studies.

N2  - Purpose: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome expressed in multiple organs caused by germline alterations of the VHL gene. We have shown VHL deletion in the "stromal" cells of retinal angiomas. The VHL protein-associated complex is a primary ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). This study examines VHL and ubiquitin expression in optic nerve hemangiomas and juxtapapillary angiomas. Methods: Using microdissection and polymerase chain reaction, four optic nerve hemangiomas (one also had juxtapapillary angioma) associated with VHL disease were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity in the VHL gene. In addition, expression of HIF and ubiquitin was evaluated in these tumors by immunohistochemistry. Results: All informative optic nerve and juxtapapillary lesions showed loss of heterozygosity in the VHL gene detected in vacuolated "stromal" cells. Both HIF and ubiquitin were highly expressed in the hemangiomas of all four VHL cases. Conclusions: Like retinal angiomas and other VHL tumor lesions, VHL gene deletion is found in optic nerve hemangiomas and juxtapapillary angiomas. These tumor cells also express HIF and ubiquitin, the protein responsible for the negative regulation of HIF that results in the hypervascularization characteristic of VHL disease.

N2  - The genetic hallmark of hemangioblastomas and clear cell-renal cell carcinomas (CC-RCCs) is loss-of-function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein. VHL is required for oxygen-dependent degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). In hemangioblastomas and CC-RCCs, HIF-1alpha is constitutively overexpressed leading to increased transcription of HIF-1-regulated genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Because loss of VHL function is associated with increased expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in CC-RCCs, we investigated the expression of HIF-1alpha, CXCR4, and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) in hemangioblastomas and CC-RCCs. Immunohistochemistry revealed overexpression of both CXCR4 and SDF-1alpha within tumor cells and endothelial cells of hemangioblastomas and CC-RCCs. HIF-1alpha was detected in tumor cell nuclei of both hemangioblastomas and CC-RCCs. A specific ELISA showed that hemangioblastomas and CC-RCCs expressed SDF-1alpha protein at levels that were significantly higher than those found in normal tissue. Analysis of the VHL-null RCC line 786-0 revealed that SDF-1alpha mRNA levels were 100-fold higher than in a subclone transfected with the wild-type VHL gene. Expression of CXCR4 and SDF-1alpha mRNA was significantly decreased in HIF-1alpha-null compared with wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). ELISA and Western blot studies for SDF-1alpha and CXCR4 protein expression confirmed the RNA findings in RCC lines and MEFs. These results suggest that loss-of-function of a single tumor suppressor gene can up-regulate the expression of both a ligand and its receptor, which may establish an autocrine signaling pathway with important roles in the pathogenesis of hemangioblastoma and CC-RCC. ©2005 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - Previous reports showed that the loss of DNA sequences on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) is consistently found in sporadic renal cell carcinomas. To evaluate the significance of this genetic change, we looked for the loss of 3p alleles in hereditary renal cell carcinomas and other tumors from patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Specific loss of alleles from chromosome 3p was detected with polymorphic DNA markers in 11 renal cell carcinomas, one pheochromocytoma, two spinal hemangioblastomas and one cerebellar hemangioblastoma from von Hippel-Lindau patients. Multiple renal cell carcinomas in individuals with von Hippel-Lindau disease showed loss of the same chromosome 3p alleles, which demonstrated that the same chromosome was deleted in each tumor. Analysis of haplotypes indicated that the loss of chromosome 3p alleles was from the chromosome bearing the balancing, wild-type allele of the VHL gene. These results are consistent with the concept that the VHL gene is a recessive oncogene. Renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas develop in predisposed family members when somatic mutational events lead to loss of chromosome 3p sequences bearing the wild-type allele of the VHL gene.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignancy commonly encountered by both clinicians and pathologists. Different RCC subtypes are classified based on histologic features, immunohistochemistry profiles, and cytogenetic abnormalities. Accurate diagnosis of subtypes is important as it has prognostic and therapeutic implications. The most common RCC subtype is clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC); the most frequent genetic abnormalities associated with CCRCC are a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3 involving 3p21 and mutations involving the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Advances in molecular pathology have identified additional molecular pathways leading to CCRCC. Researchers identified mutations of TCEB-1, monosomy 8, intact chromosome 3 and lack of VHL gene mutations in 4.7% of CCRCC. Additional evidence has been found recognizing RCC with monosomy 8 as a unique RCC subtype by describing cases with similar genetic profiles, non-specific immunohistochemistry, and histomorphology that overlapped with other known RCC types. At the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC), conventional cytogenetics are obtained on all renal neoplasms. Three recent cases of RCC with monosomy 8, normal chromosome 3 morphology, clear cell cytology and non-specific immunohistochemistry profiles were identified. We present these cases to further document this unique subtype and highlight the importance of conventional cytogenetics in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - The familial cancer syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, characterized by a predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and certain other tumor types, is caused by mutational inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Loss of VHL gene function is detected also in the vast majority of sporadic renal cell carcinomas. Previous reports have determined a protective role for VHL in response to serum withdrawal and glucose deprivation. In this study, the effect of UV irradiation on VHL-negative and VHL-positive renal carcinoma cells was examined. VHL-negative 786-O renal carcinoma cells underwent apoptosis following UV irradiation. In contrast, reintroduction of wild-type VHL expression protected 786-O cells from UV-mediated cell death. p53 and Bax levels were equivalent in VHL-negative and VHL-positive 786-O cells. Strikingly, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 underwent proteasome-dependent degradation in VHL-negative 786-O cells following UV treatment. However, p21 and p27 protein levels were stable in VHL-positive cells. Also, levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were elevated in VHL-positive cells, consistent with the protection from apoptotic stimuli. UV treatment led to increased S phase in VHL-negative, but not VHL-positive cells. Thus, following UV irradiation, diminution of p21 and p27 levels resulted in a hyperproliferative state in VHL-negative cells, leading to apoptosis. These results suggest that loss of VHL function promotes apoptosis and may provide selective pressure toward cells that are able to escape apoptosis, leading to tumorigenesis.

N2  - Current anti-tumor drug treatments are frequently inefficient due to lack of specificity. This may be improved once molecular mechanisms of disease causes will be deciphered and specific drug targets will be identified. To reach this goal molecular cause-effect relationships have to be identified which are beginning to emerge from genotype-phenotype correlation studies of hereditary tumor diseases. Accordingly, disease causing mutations have been linked with cellular down stream effects and clinical symptoms. As a consequence, diagnosis and disease description no longer focus on affected organs and clinical symptoms alone but will also draw substance from genetic and specific cellular findings. Within recent years the clinical relevance of genotype-phenotype relationships has particularly become evident from studies of the hereditary VON HIPPEL-LINDAU Syndrome. In VHL disease many disease causing germline mutations have been identified and their complex phenotypic expression has been assigned to VHL disease subtypes based on sort and type of mutations. Thus, today it is possible to confirm and diagnose VHL disease by germline mutation analysis, and moreover, to predict the likely occurrence of different organ lesions in many germline mutation carriers. Based on our newly gained understanding of mutation based functional disturbances in affected regulatory pathways specific cellular downstream effects may now be scrutinized within discovery strategies of new anti-tumor drug targets.

N2  - In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene and reduced oxygen tension promote stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors, which promote changes in the expression of genes that contribute to oncogenesis. Multiple studies have demonstrated significant perturbations in DNA methylation in ccRCC via largely unclear mechanisms that modify the transcriptional output of tumour cells. Here, we show that the methylation status of the CpG dinucleotide within the consensus hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) markedly influences the binding of HIF and that the loss of VHL results in significant alterations in the DNA methylome. Surprisingly, hypoxia, which likewise promotes HIF stabilisation and activation, has relatively few effects on global DNA methylation. Gene expression analysis of ccRCC patient samples highlighted expression of a group of genes whose transcription correlated with methylation changes, including hypoxic responsive genes such as VEGF and TGF. These results suggest that the loss of VHL alters DNA methylation profile across the genome, commonly associated with and contributing to ccRCC progression.

N2  - It has been suggested that during multiple myeloma (MM) progression, a proangiogenesis stress response occurs, but the mechanistic basis of this has not been established. It is an attractive hypothesis that loss of expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, resulting in constitutive activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), contributes to increased angiogenesis in MM. Because aberrant methylation in the VHL CpG island could cause downregulation of VHL transcription, we prospectively studied the methylation status of the VHL CpG island in 45 individuals with multiple myeloma (MM; 25 men, 20 women; mean age, 66.4 years) and in 10 individuals with borderline thrombocytopenia, who were proven to have no malignancy and served as controls. Methylation was found in 15 of 45 patients with MM at diagnosis (33.3%). The presence of methylation in the VHL CpG island was significantly associated with the development of bone disease (odds ratio, 7.5; P = .018). Patients with bone disease had an increased risk of death compared with those with no bone lytic lesions (hazard ratio [HR], 5.1; P = .13). VHL methylation was not a predictor of excess mortality (HR, 0.92; P = .91). Our data imply that methylation in the VHL CpG island is a frequent event in patients with MM and might be a potential biomarker of bone disease. Methylation in the VHL CpG island, leading to transcriptional silencing and hence decreased HIF-1alpha proteolysis, could be a possible mechanism of increased angiogenesis and altered bone marrow microenvironment that is more supportive for survival and growth of MM cells, contributing to MM bone disease. Whether it represents an early or late event of the disease merits additional study. Additional studies regarding the serum levels of HIF-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor would be mechanistically interesting.

N2  - The protean nature of renal lesions in von Hippel-Lindau disease has made surgical management difficult. To develop a sensible surgical approach the pathological and clinical manifestations of renal involvement in von Hippel-Lindau disease patients were defined. A total of 87 lesions in 9 kidneys from 6 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease was examined for size, presence of renal cell carcinoma, cystic or solid qualities and local invasion. There was no correlation between the size of the lesion and renal cell carcinoma. All 44 benign lesions were cystic, while 35% (15 of 43) of malignant lesions were cystic and 65% (28 of 43) were solid. All 9 locally invasive tumors were solid. The distribution of lesions in our patients was compared to the findings in 138 cases we collected from the literature. The 3 patterns of clinical presentation recognized were solitary, multiple and diffuse. We recommended that all lesions, cystic or solid, be excised at the time of nephron sparing surgery, with a wider margin for solid lesions, and that nephron sparing surgery should be reserved for patients with cystic and small solid lesions, with radical nephrectomy being preferred for patients with diffuse disease.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene, with Type 2B missense VHL mutations predisposing to renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Type 2B mutant pVHL is predicted to be defective in hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-alpha regulation. Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells in which the endogenous wild-type Vhl gene was replaced with the representative Type 2B VHL hotspot mutation R167Q (Vhl 2B/2B) displayed preserved physiological regulation of both HIF factors with slightly greater normoxic dysregulation of HIF-2alpha. Differentiated Vhl 2B/2B -derived teratomas overexpressed joint HIF targets Vegf and EglN3 but not the HIF-1alpha-specific target Pfk1. Vhl 2B/2B teratomas additionally displayed a growth advantage over Vhl / -derived teratomas, suggestive of a tight connection between perturbations in the degree and ratio of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha stabilization and cell growth. Vhl 2B/2B mice displayed mid-gestational embryonic lethality, whereas adult Vhl 2B/ mice exhibited susceptibility to carcinogen-promoted renal neoplasia compared with wild-type littermates at 12 months. Our experiments support a model in which the representative Type 2B R167Q mutant pVhl produces a unique profile of HIF dysregulation, thereby promoting tissue-specific effects on cell growth, development and tumor predisposition. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) present a wide spectrum of malignant diseases from rather benign to very malignant variants. The majority of these tumors are sporadic, but there are several familial (inherited) syndromes to consider, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and type 2 (MEN-1 and MEN-2), von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), tuberosclerosis, and neurofibromatosis syndromes. The MEN-1 gene is mutated not only in MEN-1 families, but a recent study shows that more than 40% of sporadic pancreatic NETs (PNETs) harbor MEN-1 gene mutations. The same study reported that ATRX/DAXX genes are mutated in a significant number of tumors, as are genes encoding components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway. These findings have implications for the new therapies that have been approved for the treatment of PNETs, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib, as well the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Small intestinal NETs show a less varied mutational pattern in that the majority of genetic alterations are found on chromosome 18. There seem to be no differences between the sporadic and the familiar type of small intestinal NETs (carcinoids). A wide range of genetic alterations have been described for the different subtypes of NETs, but the mechanisms underlying tumor development are essentially unknown except for MEN-2, in which an activating mutation of the RET proto-oncogene drives tumor progression and affords a direct genotype/phenotype correlation. Genome-wide screening of different types of NETs can now be performed for a reasonable price and is likely to generate new insights into the tumor biology and carcinogenesis in various subtypes of NETs.

N2  - Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has recently been offered for couples with an inherited predisposition for late onset disorders. This paper presents the results of PGD for a group of couples at risk for producing children with cancer predisposition. Using a standard IVF procedure, oocytes or embryos were tested for different mutations predisposing to cancer, preselecting and transferring only mutation-free embryos back to the patients. The procedure was performed for patients with predisposition to familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP), Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), retinoblastoma, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, determined by p53 tumour suppressor gene mutations, neurofibromatosis types I and II and familial posterior fossa brain tumour (hSNF5). Overall, 20 PGD cycles were performed for 10 couples, resulting in preselection and transfer of 40 mutation-free embryos, which resulted in five unaffected clinical pregnancies and four healthy children born by the present time. Despite the controversy of PGD use for late onset disorders, the data demonstrate the usefulness of this approach as the only acceptable option for at-risk couples to avoid the birth of children with an inherited predisposition to cancer, and to have a healthy child.

N2  - Background: Although the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is mutated in 60% of ccRCC, deletion of VHL in mice is insufficient for tumorigenesis, suggesting additional mutations are required. Sequencing of ccRCC tumors 92% stage I-III) identified loss of function mutations in SETD2, a histone H3 lysine 36 H3K36) trimethyltransferase. However it is unclear whether these mutations alter histone modifications. We hypothesize that loss of SETD2 histone methyltransferase activity decreases H3K36 trimethylation H3K36Me3) in ccRCC. Methods: To determine if loss of SETD2 protein expression alters H3K36Me3, SETD2 siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected into HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells and H3K36Me3 was analyzed by Western blot. To establish the frequency of SETD2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH), genomic DNA was isolated from 51 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ccRCC specimens and analyzed with Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 250K Nsp singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. To determine if there are alterations of histone modifications in metastatic ccRCC, H3K36Me3 immunohistochemical (IHC staining was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) representing 26 paired ccRCC specimens with unaffected kidney parenchyma controls. Results: SETD2 siRNA decreases H3K36Me3 >50%) compared to scrambled controls suggesting that SETD2 is a non-redundant H3K36 methyltransferase. Using SNP arrays, LOH at chromosome 3p21.31 (location of SETD2 gene) was detected in >90% of the tested ccRCC tumors. H3K36Me3 IHC staining was quantitated in TMAs representing 26 advanced ccRCC specimens. There is a 23.7% decrease in H3K36Me3 positive nuclei in ccRCC when compared to matched adjacent unaffected kidney tissue P value by paired t test < 0.0001 indicating that H3K36Me3 expression is altered in ccRCC. Thirteen tumors had a greater than 20% decrease in H3K36Me3. Discussion: Although the prevalence of SETD2 mutations in Stage I-III ccRCC is ~3%, our data suggests the loss of H3K36Me3 occurs at a higher frequency 50%) in metastatic ccRCC. In addition, SETD2 siRNA decreases H3K36Me3 and LOH occurs in >90% of tested ccRCC tumors. VHL loss may cooperate with loss of SETD2 histone methyltransferase activity to promote tumorigenesis. Future studies will focus on the mechanism of how SETD2 contributes to tumorigenesis and on determining the prognostic and predictive impact of SETD2 phenotypic changes in patient-derived tissue.

N2  - PURPOSE: We describe the earliest renal lesions associated with hereditary papillary renal cancer and estimate the prevalence of microscopic papillary renal tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Grossly normal tissue was obtained from 12 kidneys during renal surgery in 9 patients with hereditary papillary renal cancer. Tissue was examined microscopically and findings were compared to those previously reported to be associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease and sporadic renal cell carcinoma. RESULTS: A total of 92 microscopic papillary renal cell carcinoma lesions were identified on 46 of 88 slides (53%). No other lesions were identified. All tumors were solid and displayed the basophilic papillary histology characteristic of hereditary papillary renal cancer. Extrapolation of the data predicted the prevalence of 1,100 to 3,400 microscopic papillary tumors in a single kidney in a patient with hereditary papillary renal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The basophilic papillary histology characteristic of clinically apparent renal tumors in patients with hereditary papillary renal cancer also characterizes the multiple microscopic lesions seen in the kidneys. These findings suggest that the earliest renal tumor in patients with an activating hereditary mutation of the met gene is papillary basophilic renal cancer. The large number of microscopic tumors in patients with hereditary papillary renal cancer was comparable to or greater than that seen in those with von Hippel-Lindau disease.

N2  - A line of studies strongly suggest that the intravenous anesthetic, propofol, suppresses mitochondrial oxygen metabolism. It is also indicated that propofol induces the cell death in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor which is involved in cellular metabolic reprogramming by modulating gene expressions of enzymes including glycolysis pathway and oxygen utilization of mitochondria, we examined the functional role of HIF-1 activity in propofol-induced cell death. The role of HIF-1 activity on oxygen and energy metabolisms and propofol-induced cell death and caspase activity was examined in renal cell-derived RCC4 cells: RCC4-EV cells which lack von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) protein expression and RCC4-VHL cells, which express exogenous VHL, and in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. It was demonstrated that HIF-1 is involved in suppressing oxygen consumption and facilitating glycolysis in cells and that the resistance to propofol-induced cell death was established in a HIF-1 activation-dependent manner. It was also demonstrated that HIF-1 activation by treatment with HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors such as n-propyl gallate and dimethyloxaloylglycine, alleviated the toxic effects of propofol. Thus, the resistance to propofol toxicity was conferred by HIF-1 activation by not only genetic deletion of VHL but also exposure to HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors.

N2  - We aimed to exploit novel compounds with high selectivity to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with common mutations. Using the GDSC databases, we searched for compounds with high selectivity for ccRCC with VHL and/or SETD2 mutations. Clinical impact and gene interactions were analysed using TCGA database. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to validate the inhibitory effects of the compound. We identified the selective PI3Kbeta inhibitor TGX221 as a selective inhibitor for ccRCC with both VHL and SETD2 mutations. TGX221 also targeted cancer cells with CDKN2A and PTEN mutations. Changes in PTEN and CDKN2A gene sets were associated with worsened prognosis of ccRCC. TGX221 substantially and selectively inhibited the down stream products of VHL, SETD2, and PTEN in ccRCC cells with VHL and SETD2 mutations. TGX221 also exhibited significant selectivity in inhibiting cell motility and tumourigenesis of ccRCC cells with VHL and SETD2 mutations. TGX221 is a novel inhibitor with high selectivity for ccRCC with VHL and SETD2 mutations. It also targeted PTEN and CDKN2A mutations. How those genes were associated with PI3Kbeta warranted further investigations.

N2  - Eighty-three per cent of the affected members of a family with Hippel-Lindau syndrome had hypernephromas and cortical cysts of the kidney. Two of the asymptomatic members proved to have multiple hypernephromas by a prospective study. The carcinomas are frequently multifocal or bilateral. The cortical cysts are usually multiple, bilateral and small, and often contain carcinoma in the wall. The association of multifocal or bilateral hypernephromas with renal cortical cysts represents an important aspect of the Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The value of prospective renal studies in affected families is stressed.

Danish vHL Coordination Group
N2  - These clinical guidelines outline the criteria and recommendations for diagnostic and genetic work-up of families suspected of von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL), as well as recommendations for prophylactic surveillance for vHL patients. The guideline has been composed by the Danish Coordination Group for vHL which is comprised of Danish doctors and specialists interested in vHL. The recommendations are based on longstanding clinical experience, Danish original research, and extensive review of the international literature. vHL is a hereditary multi-tumour disease caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene. vHL is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Predisposed individuals are advised to undergo prophylactic examinations, as they are at lifelong risk of developing multiple cysts and tumours, especially in the cerebellum, the spinal cord, the retina (hemangioblastomas), the kidneys (renal cell carcinoma), the adrenal glands (pheochromocytoma), the pancreas, as well as in other organs. As many different organs can be affected, several medical specialities often take part in both diagnosis and treatment of manifestations. vHL should be suspected in individuals with a family history of the disease, and/or in individuals with a vHL-associated manifestation; i.e. a hemangioblastoma in the retina or the central nervous system, familial or bilateral pheochromocytomas, familial, multiple, or early onset renal cell carcinomas, and in individuals with an endolymphatic sac tumour in the inner ear. Individuals suspected of vHL should be referred to a department of clinical genetics for genetic work-up and counselling as well as have a clinical work-up to identify any undiagnosed vHL-associated manifestations. This guideline describes the elements of the clinical diagnostic work-up, as well as the genetic work-up, counselling, and mutation screening. Individuals who are affected with vHL, individuals at risk of vHL, and VHL-mutation carriers are advised to follow the surveillance program which consists of regular prophylactic examinations relevant to different age groups. The examinations are recommended to start in infancy with annual paediatric examinations and ophthalmoscopy until the age of five years. From five to 14 years, annual plasma-metanephrine and plasma-normetanephrine tests, as well as annual hearing examinations are added. Also, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) examination of the CNS and abdomen should be done between the ages of eight and 14 years. After the age of 15 years, individuals should be referred to: a) annual ophthalmoscopy in dilation, b) annual neurological examination, c) every two years: MRIs of the CNS, including the inner ear, d) annual ultrasound/MRI of the abdomen, e) annual plasma-metanephrine, plasma-normetanephrine, and plasma-chromogranin A tests, and f) annual hearing examination at a department of audiology. It is advised that one doctor takes on the responsibility of coordination of and referral to the many examinations, and the communication with the patient. To facilitate the coordination, and especially for the patients' own use, a mobile chart can be used. In 2012, the Danish vHL Coordination Group established a national vHL database comprising individuals with vHL and their relatives, as well as individuals examined for vHL. The database is designated to be a treatment and diagnostic instrument, as well as a tool in future vHL research in Denmark.

N2  - The most common type of the renal cancers detected in humans is clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). These tumors are usually initiated by biallelic gene inactivation of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) factor in the renal epithelium, which deregulates the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha, and provokes their constitutive activation irrespective of the cellular oxygen availability. While HIF1alpha can act as a ccRCC tumor suppressor, HIF2alpha has emerged as the key HIF isoform that is essential for ccRCC tumor progression. Indeed, preclinical and clinical data have shown that pharmacological inhibitors of HIF2alpha can efficiently combat ccRCC growth. In this review, we discuss the molecular basis underlying the oncogenic potential of HIF2alpha in ccRCC by focusing on those pathways primarily controlled by HIF2alpha that are thought to influence the progression of these tumors.

N2  - As part of an attempt to locate the von Hippel-Lindau locus (VHL) on chromosome 3, we evaluated 41 families with von Hippel-Lindau disease from the United States and Canada. One large family was identified whose disease phenotype was distinct from typical VHL. The most common disease manifestation was pheochromocytoma occurring in 57% (27/47) of affected family members. Few (4/47) affected family members had symptomatic spinal or cerebellar hemangioblastomas; no affected family member had renal cell carcinoma (0/47) or pancreatic cysts (0/24). Previously, genetic analysis demonstrated that the disease manifestations in this family were linked to RAF1 and D3S18, markers shown to be linked to typical VHL. These results suggest that there are mutant alleles at the VHL locus associated with distinct tissue specificities.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of radiosurgery inducing malignancy in neurofibromatosis-2 (NF2) and von Hippel-Lindau disease. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 118 NF2 and 19 von Hippel-Lindau disease patients, totalling 906 and 62 patient-years of follow-up data, respectively. RESULTS: Two cases of intracranial malignancy were identified, both of which occurred in NF2 patients. One of these was thought to have arisen before the radiosurgery; the other was a glioblastoma diagnosed 3 years after radiosurgery. CONCLUSION: Because gliomas may occur in as many as 4% of NF2 patients, this may not represent an increased risk. We continue to offer radiosurgery treatment to selected NF2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease patients and consider that the late risk of malignancy arising after irradiation must be put in the context of the condition being treated, the treatment options available to these individuals, and their life expectancy.

N1  - literature review
N2  - The combination of pituitary adenomas (PA) and phaeochromocytomas (phaeo) or paragangliomas (PGL) is a rare event. Although these endocrine tumours may occur together by coincidence, there is mounting evidence that, in at least some cases, classical phaeo/PGL-predisposing genes may also play a role in pituitary tumorigenesis. A new condition that we termed '3Pas' for the association of PA with phaeo and/or PGL was recently described in patients with succinate dehydrogenase mutations and PAs. It should also be noted that the classical tumour suppressor gene, MEN1 that is the archetype of the PA-predisposing genes, is also rarely associated with phaeos in both mice and humans with MEN1 defects. In this report, we review the data leading to the discovery of 3PAs, other associations linking PAs with phaeos and/or PGLs, and the corresponding clinical and molecular genetics.

N2  - To evaluate the significance of altered DNA methylation during renal tumorigenesis, tumorous tissues (T) and corresponding nontumorous renal tissues (N) from 94 patients with renal tumors, and normal renal tissues (C) from 16 patients without renal tumors were investigated. DNA methylation status on CpG islands of the p16, human MutL homologue 1 (hMLH1), von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) and thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1) genes and the methylated in tumor (MINT) -1, -2, -12, -25 and -31 clones and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 expression were examined by bisulfite modification and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The average number of methylated CpG islands was significantly higher in N than in C, and was even higher in T. The average number of methylated CpG islands in N was significantly correlated with a higher histological grade of corresponding conventional renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). The average number of methylated CpG islands in RCCs was significantly correlated with macroscopic configuration with extranodular or multinodular growth, higher histological grade, infiltrating growth pattern and vascular involvement. The recurrence-free survival rate of patients with RCCs showing accumulation of DNA methylation was significantly lower than that of patients not showing this feature. The incidence of nuclear immunoreactivity for DNMT1 tended to be higher in proximal tubules from N than in those from C, and was significantly higher in RCCs. From the viewpoint of altered DNA methylation, N is at the precancerous stage, and N showing accumulation of DNA methylation may generate more malignant RCCs. Regional DNA hypermethylation may be associated with renal tumorigenesis from a precancerous condition to malignant progression and become a predictor of patient prognosis.

N2  - beta-cells sense glucose and secrete appropriate amounts of insulin by coupling glucose uptake and glycolysis with quantitative ATP production via mitochondrial oxidative pathways. Therefore, oxidative phosphorylation is essential for normal beta-cell function. Multiple cell types adapt to hypoxia by inducing a transcriptional programme coordinated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). HIF activity is regulated by the von Hippel-Lindau (Vhl) protein, which targets the HIF. alpha subunit for proteasomal degradation in the presence of oxygen. Several recent studies have shown that Vhl deletion in beta-cells results in Hif1. alpha activation, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and glucose intolerance. This was found to be because of alterations in beta-cell gene expression inducing a switch from aerobic glucose metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis, thus disrupting the GSIS triggering pathway. Situations in which islets may become hypoxic are discussed, in particular islet transplantation which has been reported to cause islet hypoxia because of an inadequate blood supply post-transplant. Aside from this principal role for HIF in negatively regulating beta-cell glucose sensing, other aspects of hypoxia signalling are discussed including beta-cell differentiation, development and vascularization. In conclusion, recent studies clearly show that hypoxia response mechanisms can negatively impact on glucose sensing mechanisms in the beta-cell and this has the potential to impair beta-cell function in a number of physiological and clinical situations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Despite recent advances in cancer therapies, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains difficult to treat. Most RCCs result from inactivation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, leading to stable expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-alpha (HIF-1alpha, -2alpha, -3alpha) and the induction of downstream target genes, including those responsible for angiogenesis and metastasis. While VHL is inactivated in the majority of RCC cases, expression of the PTEN tumor suppressor is reduced in about 30% of cases. PTEN functions to antagonize PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, thereby controlling cell growth and survival. Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR leads to increased HIF-1alpha expression in certain cancer cells, supporting the rationale of using mTOR inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. Notably, HIF-2alpha, rather than HIF-1alpha, has been shown to play a critical role in renal tumorigenesis. To investigate whether HIF-2alpha is similarly regulated by the PI3K pathway in VHL(-/-)RCC cells, we manipulated PI3K signaling using PTEN overexpression and siRNA knockdown studies and pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K or Akt. Our data support a novel role for wild-type PTEN in promoting HIF-2alpha activity in VHL null RCC cells. This mechanism is unique to the cellular environment in which HIF-2alpha expression is deregulated, resulting from the loss of VHL function. Our data show that PTEN induces HIF-2alpha transcriptional activity by inhibiting expression of Yin Yang 1 (YY1), which acts as a novel corepressor of HIF-2alpha. Further, PTEN suppression of YY1 is mediated through antagonism of PI3K signaling. We conclude that wild-type PTEN relieves the repressive nature of YY1 at certain HIF-2alpha target promoters and that this mechanism may promote early renal tumorigenesis resulting from VHL inactivation by increasing HIF-2alpha activity.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome (1/36,000 live births) with highly penetrance that predispose to the development of a panel of highly vascularized tumors (model of tumoral angiogenesis). Main manifestations include central nervous system (CNS) and retinal haemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. RCC has become the first potential cause of mortality and VHL disease is the main cause of inherited RCC. The disease is caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor-suppressor gene that plays a major role in regulation of the oxygen-sensing pathway by targeting the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF for degradation in proteasome. VHL has also major HIF-independent functions, specially in regulation of primary cilium, extracellular matrix and apoptosis. Somatic inactivation of the VHL gene is the main molecular event in most sporadic RCC and the treatment of advanced RCC has been revolutionized by targeted therapy with drugs that block angiogenesis. These drugs are now in first line in metastatic sporadic RCC and have shown promising results for RCC, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and malignant pheochromocytomas in VHL patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous disease as reflected in its presentation and clinical course, pathological subtypes, nuclear grades and molecular biology. Emerging data indicate that renal tumors express a variety of molecular tumor markers and unique patterns of gene expression. Clinically the disease behaves quite heterogeneously, with courses ranging from indolent to highly aggressive. Surgical monotherapy or as part of a multimodal approach remains the standard of care for most cases of RCC. Radical or partial nephrectomy is associated with a 5-year cancer specific survival (CSS) of 85-97% for pT1 tumors. Unfortunately, 20% of patients have either locally advanced or node positive (N+) RCC while another 22% have metastatic RCC (mRCC) at presentation. Unlike the outcomes in early localized disease, survival rates for N+ patients are poor and patients with mRCC are rarely cured despite aggressive multimodal therapy. Classic cytotoxic chemotherapy has repeatedly been shown to have little effect and only 5-20% of patients with mRCC respond to immunologic agents such as interferon and/ or interleukin. Cytoreductive nephrectomy with systemic immunotherapy is associated with few cures with median survivals of 12-24months. Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular origins and pathways of RCC have led to the development of more effective targeted therapies. Here we review the molecular pathways that define the pertinent therapeutic targets in RCC and the clinical data for these new and promising agents. © Current Science Inc. 2007.

N2  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is an inherited cancer syndrome that includes pheochromocytoma. Germline mutations in RET are responsible for MEN 2 but the precise pathogenetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis are unknown. We have recently identified possible mechanisms of tumor formation in patients with MEN 2A-related pheochromocytoma. Two of nine tumors investigated, however, did not reveal either of these mechanisms. In the present study, we therefore searched for other possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of MEN 2A-related pheochromocytoma. Hereditary pheochromocytoma also occurs in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a syndrome consisting of tumors caused by inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. A subset of sporadic pheochromocytomas have somatic mutations in RET or VHL, suggesting that both genes contribute to pheochromocytoma pathogenesis in a subset of tumors. It is unknown, however, whether VHL gene alterations would be associated with tumorigenesis in hereditary, MEN 2-related pheochromocytoma. We therefore investigated four pheochromocytomas from patients with MEN 2A and RET germline mutations for the presence of allelic deletion and/or somatic mutation of the VHL gene. LOH analysis using the polymorphic markers D3S1038 and D3S1110 that map to the VHL gene locus 3p25/26, revealed evidence for somatic VHL gene deletion in all four MEN 2A-related pheochromocytomas. Mutation analysis of the VHL gene showed frameshift mutations in two tumors and a splice acceptor mutation in one tumor. The remaining tumor did show LOH but not mutation of the VHL gene. These results suggest that somatic genetic alterations of the VHL gene may play a role in the tumorigenesis of some MEN 2A-related pheochromocytomas.

N2  - Monogenic or single-gene forms of human hypertension result from mutations involving regulatory elements of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) or occur in syndromes associated with hereditary pheochromocytoma. RAAS gain-of-function mutations result in sodium retention, suppression of plasma renin activity, and often, but not invariably, hypokalemia. Hereditary RAAS syndromes result from intrinsic renal abnormalities (apparent mineralocorticoid excess and Liddle's syndromes) or from mineralocorticoid excess states (congenital adrenal hyperplasia and glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism). In the hereditary pheochromocytoma syndromes many asymptomatic individuals are identified because they are at-risk individuals in kindreds with a pheochromocytoma-predisposing syndrome. On the other hand, up to 25% of subjects with presumed "sporadic" pheochromocytoma have germline mutations in one of four pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes (the RET proto-oncogene, von Hippel-Lindau gene, neurofibromatosis F1 gene, and succinate dehydrogenase subunit D and succinate dehydrogenase subunit B genes). Hereditary pheochromocytomas are typically intra-adrenal and bilateral and patients typically present at younger ages compared with sporadic pheochromocytoma. [References: 25]

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the major subtype of kidney cancer that is characterized by frequent inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (. VHL) gene in 80-90% of the tumors. Recent reports using massive parallel sequencing technologies have discovered additional cancer driver genes. PBRM1 was found to be mutated in about 40% of ccRCC tumors, whereas BAP1 and SETD2 were each mutated in about 10-15% of ccRCC tumors. JARID1C and UTX, two histone H3 demethylases, were also found to harbor mutations in ccRCC, albeit at lower rates. ccRCC tumors display a high degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, with some mutations present in all cancer cells (ubiquitous), whereas others are subclonal. The VHL mutations were always ubiquitous in the tumors; PBRM1 mutations were also ubiquitous but to a lesser extent. On the contrary, mutations in BAP1, SETD2, JARID1C, and UTX were all subclonal, meaning that they were present in a subset of cancer cells in a tumor. The prognostic value of PBRM1 mutations in ccRCC is still controversial, whereas BAP1 mutations were tightly linked to worse clinical outcomes in multiple studies. The molecular functions of these newly identified cancer driver genes are discussed, and they were known readers, writers, or erasers of histone marks on histone H2 and H3 tails that are very close to each other, suggesting that these factors might functionally interact and affect common pathways. The studies on these newly identified tumor suppressors will shed light on ccRCC tumorigenesis and development, and will likely lead to development of novel therapeutic interventions for ccRCC patients.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is inactivated frequently in sporadic clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) by genetic alteration (mutation, loss of heterozygosity, or promoter hypermethylation). However, the pathological or prognostic significance of VHL gene alteration has not been well defined. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between VHL alteration and clinopathologic findings in ccRCCs. We performed a systematic computerized search of online databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (up to July 2018). From ten studies, 1,082 patients were included in the pooled analyses of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pathological features (nuclear grade and disease stage) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for overall survival (OS). VHL alteration was not significantly associated with nuclear grade (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.59-1.06, p = 0.12) or disease stage (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.79-1.46, p = 0.65). There was also no significant correlation between VHL alteration and OS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.43-1.29, p = 0.30). When we pooled HRs for OS according to the VHL alteration types, the combined HRs were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.47-1.11, p = 0.14) for VHL mutations and 1.32 (95% CI: 0.70-2.47, p = 0.39) for methylation. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that VHL gene alteration is not significantly associated with the pathological features and survival in patients with ccRCC.

N2  - The majority of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are caused by an accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and the overexpression of downstream genes in response to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene becoming inactivated. In the present study, our hypothesis was that BNIP3, a gene positioned downstream of HIF, would be expressed at a higher level in ccRCC; however, instead, lower levels of BNIP3 expression were identified in RCC tumor tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. These changes were associated with lower levels of VHL, and higher levels of HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor. BNIP3 was also undetectable in three investigated RCC cell lines (786-O, ACHN, A498) and GRC-1-1 cells. Methylation of the BNIP3 promoter was not detected, and neither did treatment with a methylation inhibitor cause cell proliferation. However, treatment with a histone deacetylation inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), inhibited cultured RCC cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis and restored BNIP3 expression. Furthermore, histone deacetylation of the BNIP3 promoter was identified in ACHN and 786-O cells, and the acetylation status was restored following TSA treatment. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that histone deacetylation, but not methylation, is most likely to cause BNIP3 inactivation in RCC. The data also indicated that restoration of BNIP3 expression by a histone deacetylation inhibitor led to growth inhibition and apoptotic promotion in RCC.

N2  - CONTEXT: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease manifests as a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. Previous studies of VHL disease have documented several genotype-phenotype correlations; however, many such correlations are still unknown. Increased identification of new mutations and patients with previously described mutations will allow us to better understand how VHL mutations influence disease phenotypes.
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A total of 45 individuals from five unrelated families were evaluated, of which 21 patients were either diagnosed with VHL disease or showed strong evidence related to this disease. We compared the patients' gene sequencing results with their medical records including CT or MRI scans, eye examinations and laboratory/pathological examinations. Patients were also interviewed to obtain information regarding their family history.
RESULTS: We identified four missense mutations: c.239G>T (p.Ser80Ile), linked with VHL Type 2B, was associated with renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and hemangioma in the cerebellum; c.232A>T (p.Asn78Tyr) manifested as RCC alone and likely caused VHL Type 1; c.500G>A (p.Arg167Gln) mutation was more likely to cause VHL Type 2 than Type 1 as it preferentially induced Pheo and HB in the retina, cerebellum and spinal cord; c.293A>G (p.Try98Cys) was associated with Pheo and thus likely induced VHL Type 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Characterizing VHL disease genotype-phenotype correlations can enhance the ability to predict the risk of individual patients developing different VHL-related phenotypes. Ultimately, such insight will improve the diagnostics, surveillance and treatment of VHL patients.
PRECIS: Four missense mutations in VHL have been identified in 21 individuals when five unrelated Chinese families with VHL disease were analyzed; VHL mutations are highly associated with unique disease phenotypes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: No approved systemic therapy exists for von Hippel-Lindau disease, an autosomal dominant disorder with pleiotropic organ manifestations that include clear cell renal cell carcinomas; retinal, cerebellar, and spinal haemangioblastomas; pheochromocytomas; pancreatic serous cystadenomas; and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. We aimed to assess the activity and safety of pazopanib in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.METHODS: In this non-randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, adult patients with clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease were recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and were treated with pazopanib (800 mg orally daily) for 24 weeks, with an option to continue treatment if desired by the patient and treating physician. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response and safety in the per-protocol population. The objective response was measured for each patient and each lesion type. Radiographic assessments were done at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout the study. Activity and safety were assessed with continuous monitoring and a Bayesian design. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01436227, and is closed to accrual.FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012, and Aug 10, 2016, we screened 37 patients with genetically confirmed or clinical features consistent with von Hippel-Lindau disease, of whom 31 eligible patients were treated with pazopanib. The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 42% (13 of 31 patients). By lesion sites responses were observed in 31 (52%) of 59 renal cell carcinomas, nine (53%) of 17 pancreatic lesions, and two (4%) of 49 CNS haemangioblastomas. Seven (23%) of 31 patients chose to stay on the treatment after 24 weeks. Four (13%) of 31 patients withdrew from the study because of grade 3 or 4 transaminitis, and three (10%) discontinued study treatment because of treatment intolerance with multiple intercurrent grade 1-2 toxicities. Treatment-related serious adverse events included one case each of appendicitis and gastritis and one patient had a fatal CNS bleed.INTERPRETATION: Pazopanib was associated with encouraging preliminary activity in von Hippel-Lindau disease, with a side-effect profile consistent with that seen in previous trials. Pazopanib could be considered as a treatment choice for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and growing lesions, or to reduce the size of unresectable lesions in these patients. The safety and activity of pazopanib in this setting warrants further investigation.FUNDING: Novartis Inc and NIH National Cancer Institute core grant.

N2  - Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are critical regulators of the response to oxygen deficiency by activating target genes involved in a variety of biological functions. HIFs have been implicated in the pathophysiology of numerous pathologies including cancer. Patients with mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, an essential regulator of HIF activity, develop tumors in several organs including the pancreas. Previous functional studies of HIF activation in the pancreas have used Vhlh (the murine homolog of VHL) deficient mice. However, the role of each specific HIF transcription factors in the pancreas has not been thoroughly examined. We derived mice that constitutively express a normoxia-stable form of HIF2alpha in the pancreas. Activation of HIF2alpha in the pancreas severely impairs postnatal exocrine pancreas. Mice with pancreas-specific activation of HIF2alpha develop histological features reminiscent of pancreatitis including loss of acinar cells, ductal dilation and fibrosis. Moreover, we provide evidence that signaling pathways important for acinar cell homeostasis are altered in HIF2alpha-overexpressing pancreata.

N2  - p53 mutations are rarely detected in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), but, paradoxically, these tumors remain highly resistant to chemotherapy and death receptor-induced death. Here, we show that the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2alpha), a critical oncogenic event in CCRCC following the loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, leads to Hdm2-mediated suppression of p53. Primary CCRCC specimens exhibiting strong hypoxic signatures show increased levels of activated nuclear phospho-Hdm2(Ser<sup>166</sup>), which is concomitant with low p53 expression. The abrogation of Hdm2-p53 interaction using the small-molecule Hdm2 inhibitor nutlin-3 or the downregulation of HIF2alpha via HIF2alpha-specific short hairpin RNA or wild-type VHL reconstitution restores p53 function and reverses the resistance of CCRCC cells to Fas-mediated and chemotherapy-induced cell death. These findings unveil a mechanistic link between HIF2alpha and p53 and provide a rationale for combining Hdm2 antagonists with chemotherapy for the treatment of CCRCC. ©2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis of lung cancer remains poor and clinically applicable prognostic markers have not yet been satisfactory identified. Several chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) have been associated with metastasis, relapse, and survival of patients with lung cancer; however, no study has focused exclusively on identifying CNAs at a gene level. The aim of this study was to identify genes whose CNAs are associated with survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The CNA status of a panel of 48 genes was detected by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization in 56 lung adenocarcinoma samples. The follow-up time of these patients was 8.5-65.7 months. The gene CNAs were analyzed for their association with patient survival. RESULTS: Cox univariate regression analysis revealed that EGFR gain (hazard ratio (HR) 3.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-9.10), VHL loss (HR 4.56, 95% CI 1.85-11.27) and WWOX loss (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.60-10.69) were each associated with poor survival. Multivariate analyses including EGFR gain, VHL loss and WWOX loss, as well as the clinicopathological variables such as age, sex, tumor size, tumor differentiation and TNM stage showed that EGFR gain (HR 4.63, 95% CI 1.69-12.7) and VHL loss (HR 4.82, 95% CI 1.41-16.43) were independent prognostic factors for poor survival, whereas WWOX loss lost statistical significance. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that EGFR gain and VHL loss are associated with poor overall survival for lung adenocarcinoma patients and may be used as prognostic markers.

N2  - The second joint conference of the AACR and the EACR held in Oxford from 9-12 September 1997 was successful from many vantage points. While providing an optimal setting in which European and American cancer researchers could meet and exchange information, the conference had an excellent scientific programme which encompassed both methodological updates on important models used in cancer research and presentations of recent key advances in the molecular genetics of cancer. Lower eukaryotes are established model organisms used to elucidate fundamental but complex eukaryotic processes, such as those involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, and the progressive availability of their genome sequence makes them even more attractive. Transgenic mouse models are increasingly used not only for the study of one gene of interest but for investigation of the interactions among genes involved in the same pathway. The family of tumours suppressor genes is growing fast and several presentations were devoted to recently identified members such as the Von Hippel-Lindau gene, the FHIT gene and the PTEN gene. The systematic analysis of loss of heterozygosity on multiple loci in tumour specimens can provide the basis for preliminary models of molecular multistep progression in some tumour types, even though this is limited by the high degree of complexity found. Mechanisms of cell cycle regulation and apoptosis continue to be dissected and to constitute a fruitful area of investigation, with important recent insights on the p53-MDM2 autoregulatory loop and on the involvement of E2F-l in apoptosis.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factors are transcription factors controlling energy, iron metabolism, erythropoiesis, and development. When these proteins are dysregulated, they contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, mutations in genes encoding alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-alpha) have not previously been identified in any cancer. Here we report two novel somatic gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2A) in two patients, one presenting with paraganglioma and the other with paraganglioma and somatostatinoma, both of whom had polycythemia. The two mutations were associated with increased HIF-2alpha activity and increased protein half-life. Copyright © 2012 Massachusetts Medical Society.

N2  - While speculation has centered on a role for nuclear lamins in tumor progression for many years, most of the diseases that have been linked to lamin mutation are dystrophic in nature, often limiting the proliferation potential of affected cells in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, these lamin mutations, particularly in the LMNA gene that encodes A-type lamins, have provided an interesting tool set to understand functions of nuclear intermediate filament proteins in cell cycle progress and various means of exit, including quiescence, senescence, and differentiation down various lineages. The picture that has emerged is complex with lamins controlling the activity of key cell cycle factors such as the retinoblastoma protein (RB) and interacting with several important signal transduction pathways. Here we describe the current state of knowledge and speculate that lamins may be intimately involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, acting at the interface between cancer and aging. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - The hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha) contributes to the vascular response to hypoxia. Hypoxia inhibits prolyl hydroxylation of the N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD), thus preventing binding of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) and proteasomal degradation; additionally, hypoxia inhibits asparagyl hydroxylation of the C-TAD, thus diminishing cofactor recruitment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from NADPH oxidases (NOXs) have been shown to control vascular functions and to promote vascular remodeling. However, whether HIF-2alpha, ROS, and NOXs are linked under such nonhypoxic conditions is unclear. We found that activation of NOX4 by thrombin or H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf> increased HIF-2alpha protein because of decreased pVHL binding in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Thrombin, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, and NOX4 overexpression increased HIF-2alpha N-TAD and C-TAD activity, which was prevented by ascorbate treatment or mutation of the hydroxylation sites in the TADs. HIF-2alpha also mediated induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and the proliferative response to thrombin, H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, or NOX4 overexpression. Thus, ROS derived from NOX4 in response to thrombin stabilize HIF-2alpha by preventing hydroxylation of the N-and C-TAD, thus allowing formation of transcriptionally active HIF-2alpha, which promotes PASMC proliferation. Together, these findings present the first evidence that HIF-2alpha is critically involved in the ROS-regulated vascular remodeling processes. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the VHL tumor-suppressor gene, leading to the dysregulation of many hypoxia-induced genes. Affected individuals are at increased risk of developing recurrent and bilateral kidney cysts and dysplastic lesions which may progress to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Following the eponymous VHL gene inactivation, ccRCCs evolve through additional genetic alterations, resulting in both intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity. Genomic studies have identified frequent mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation. Currently, local therapeutic options include nephron-sparing surgery and alternative ablative procedures. For advanced metastatic disease, systemic treatment, including inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor pathways and mTOR pathways, as well as immunotherapy are available. Multimodal therapy, targeting multiple signaling pathways and/or enhancing the immune response, is currently being investigated. A deeper understanding of the fundamental biology of ccRCC development and progression, as well as the development of novel and targeted therapies will be accelerated by new preclinical models, which will greatly inform the search for clinical biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment.

N2  - Targeted therapy has radically altered the way metastatic renal cancer is treated. Six drugs are now licensed in this setting, with several other agents under evaluation. Sunitinib is currently the most widely used in the first line setting with impressive efficacy and an established toxicity profile. However, as further randomised studies report and as newer drugs become available this may change. In this review, we address our current understanding of targeted therapy in renal cancer. We also discuss areas in which our knowledge is incomplete, including the identification of correlative biomarkers and mechanisms of drug resistance. Finally, we will describe the major areas of clinical research that will report over the next few years. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.

N2  - The understanding of cellular processes underlying tumour biology has allowed the development of novel molecular-targeted drugs with optimistic results in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene are found in 75% of sporadic RCCs, which results in upregulation of several genes involved in angiogenesis, e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Other activated pathways in RCC are the epidermal growth factor receptor and the mTOR pathway, which regulate survival and cell growth. In addition to temsirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) two different strategies have been studied to inhibit these targets: monoclonal antibodies, e.g. bevacizumab, and small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, sunitinib and AG 013736. Phase II studies with these drugs reported substantial clinical activity in advanced RCC. Survival benefit was reported with temsirolimus, sunitinib and sorafenib in randomized trials, which led to the accelerated approval of sorafenib and sunitinib for advanced RCC by regulatory authorities in the USA and Europe. Nevertheless, as new therapies develop, new challenges arise for the optimum use of these targeted drugs. We discuss the rationale and the clinical development of these novel molecular-targeted agents, with special emphasis on updated information presented at recent meetings because of the relevance of the data reported and the potential future impact in the management of patients with RCC. © 2006 The Authors.

N2  - Developments in genetic and genomic technology have produced vast quantities of data that are gradually yielding new insights into fundamental cellular and molecular processes. In particular, they have revealed some differences between normal and transformed cells that could potentially be exploited to develop targeted, personalized cancer therapies with unprecedented efficiencies. This review summarizes recent findings from synthetic lethality (SL) screens against cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that can be targeted with small molecule kinase inhibitors. SL screens can be used to identify cancers sensitive to CDK inhibitors. Several SL partners of specific CDKs have been identified, including MYC, K-Ras, VHL, PI3K, and PARP, all of which are discussed in the review. CDK inhibitors have been in clinical trials for nearly 20 years and it has become clear that effective therapy using these compounds will require careful selection of patients with respect to the specific molecular phenotype of their disease.

N2  - A chemoorganotrophic Gram-negative bacterium was isolated by means of a diffusion sandwich system from a soil sample from the Sierra Nevada National Park, Spain. Strain F-279,208<sup>T</sup> was oxidase and catalase positive, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming and motile by single polar flagellum. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD genes revealed that strain F-279,208<sup>T</sup> belongs to the Pseudomonas putida group with Pseudomonas mosselii and Pseudomonas entomophila as its closest relatives. DNA-DNA hybridization assays and phenotypic traits confirmed that this strain belongs to a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F-279,208<sup>T</sup> (=DSM 28043<sup>T</sup>=LMG 27941<sup>T</sup>), and during fermentation it produces xantholysins, a family of lipodepsipeptides. The major compound, xantholysin A, showed an interesting activity in a RCC4 kidney tumor cell line with inactivation of VHL linked with the HIF pathway, without any cytotoxic effects against other human tumor cell lines tested including, liver, pancreas and breast. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

N2  - The eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT mediates folding of an essential subset of newly synthesized proteins, including the tumor suppressor VHL. Here we show that chaperonin binding is specified by two short hydrophobic beta strands in VHL that, upon folding, become buried within the native structure. These TRiC binding determinants are disrupted by tumor-causing point mutations that interfere with chaperonin association and lead to misfolding. Strikingly, while unable to fold correctly in vivo, some of these VHL mutants can reach the native state when refolded in a chaperonin-independent manner. The specificity of TRiC/CCT for extended hydrophobic beta strands may help explain its role in folding aggregation-prone polypeptides. Our findings reveal a class of disease-causing mutations that inactivate protein function by disrupting chaperone-mediated folding in vivo.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the susceptibility genes RET, SDHB, SDHD, and VHL have been reported in 7.5-24% of patients with pheochromocytoma (Pheo) or paraganglioma (PGL) and sporadic presentation. The purpose of the present study was to establish population-based data on the frequency of germline mutations in patients with apparently sporadic Pheo or abdominal PGL in Western Sweden. METHODS: From the Swedish National Cancer Registry, all patients with Pheo or PGL in Western Sweden (population 1.72 million) registered between 1958 and 2009 were identified (n = 256). Patients were characterized using register data, hospital records, and clinical interviews. All living patients with Pheo or abdominal PGL and sporadic presentation (n = 81) were invited to genetic screening; 71 patients accepted. Germline mutations were investigated by using direct sequencing for point mutations in RET, SDHB, SDHD, and VHL, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for gross deletions in SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, and VHL. Plasma or urinary metanephrines and/or urinary catecholamines were used for biochemical follow-up. RESULTS: The prevalence of germline mutations was 5.6%. Mutations were only seen in RET (n = 1) and SDHB (n = 3). Notably, in the patients with SDHB mutations, no malignant phenotype was observed during a mean follow-up of 23.3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of germline mutations in patients with apparently sporadic Pheo and abdominal PGL in Western Sweden was lower than in previous studies. Variations in reported frequencies of germline mutations in patients with clinically sporadic Pheo/PGL may reflect geographical differences or patient selection.

N2  - The study of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer holds the key to the discovery of novel biological markers for diagnostics and can help to delineate important mechanisms of disease. We have identified 12 loci that are differentially methylated in serous ovarian cancers and endometrioid ovarian and endometrial cancers with respect to normal control samples. The strongest signal showed hypermethylation in tumors at a CpG island within the ZNF154 promoter. We show that hypermethylation of this locus is recurrent across solid human epithelial tumor samples for 15 of 16 distinct cancer types from TCGA. Furthermore, ZNF154 hypermethylation is strikingly present across a diverse panel of ENCODE cell lines, but only in those derived from tumor cells. By extending our analysis from the Illumina 27K Infinium platform to the 450K platform, to sequencing of PCR amplicons from bisulfite treated DNA, we demonstrate that hypermethylation extends across the breadth of the ZNF154 CpG island. We have also identified recurrent hypomethylation in two genomic regions associated with CASP8 and VHL. These three genes exhibit significant negative correlation between methylation and gene expression across many cancer types, as well as patterns of DNaseI hypersensitivity and histone marks that reflect different chromatin accessibility in cancer vs. normal cell lines. Our findings emphasize hypermethylation of ZNF154 as a biological marker of relevance for tumor identification. Epigenetic modifications affecting the promoters of ZNF154, CASP8, and VHL are shared across a vast array of tumor types and may therefore be important for understanding the genomic landscape of cancer.

N2  - Central nervous system hemangioblastoma is a neoplasm with characteristic and well-described histopathological features, including proliferation of vascular and stromal cells. yet, the histogenesis of the stromal cell component and its neoplastic capacity as compared with the vascular component are still controversial. Stromal cells were selectively procured from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease patient with a cerebellar hemangioblastoma and studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the VHL gene locus and associated microsatellite regions. The stromal cells consistently showed LOH. Analysis of mixed stromal anti vascular areas of this tumor and four other hemangioblastomas of VHL patients showed that loss of heterozygosity was partially obscured. These preliminary results suggest that the stromal component of hemangioblastomas contains genetic alterations consistent with a neoplastic nature. Additional samples of pure stromal cells need to be analyzed to establish the prevalence of VHL gene deletion in stromal cells of capillary hemangioblastoma and, hence, its pathogenetic significance.

N2  - Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene product pVHL is the cause of inherited VHL disease and is associated with sporadic kidney cancer. pVHL is found in a multiprotein complex with elongins B/C, Cul2, and Rbx1 forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex called VEC. This modular enzyme targets the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. Consequently, tumour cells lacking functional pVHL overproduce the products of HIF-target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis. This likely accounts for the hypervascular nature of VHL-associated neoplasms. Although pVHL has been linked to the cell-cycle, differentiation, and the regulation of extracellular matrix assembly, microenvironment pH, and tissue invasiveness, this review will focus on the recent insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of VEC.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common malignant neoplasm of the kidney and belongs to the few human tumors known to develop from mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. VHL germline mutations are associated with hereditary ccRCCs in VHL disease. However, somatic VHL gene defects may also occur in sporadic ccRCCs. In this study, we analyzed the frequency and the spectrum of VHL gene alterations in 35 Italian patients with sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Tumor-specific intragenic VHL pathogenic mutations were detected in 38% (11/29) of the ccRCC patients and 33% (2/6) of the patients with other types of RCC. One novel 18-bp in-tandem duplication and 4 previously unreported nucleotide changes in the VHL gene were described. Microsatellite analysis showed loss of heterozygosity for at least 1 informative marker in 43% (9/21) of the ccRCCs and 50% (3/6) of the non-ccRCCs; 5 of the 13 tumors (38%) harboring VHL gene alterations also had loss of heterozygosity for at least 1 microsatellite marker. Our results confirm that somatic inactivation of the VHL gene may play a pivotal role in the tumorigenesis of sporadic ccRCCs in Italian patients and suggests that mutation analysis of the VHL gene may be helpful for discriminating sporadic, VHL-gene-related ccRCCs from those related to VHL disease.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by a high risk of developing benign and malignant tumors, including central nervous system hemangioblastomas (CNS HBs). For an early diagnosis of VHL, before the occurrence of cancers (especially renal cell carcinoma), it is of huge importance to initiate VHL genetic testing in at-risk patients. The aim of the study was to assess the psychological impact of VHL genetic testing in patients previously diagnosed with a CNS HB. From 1999 until 2015, 55 patients underwent surgery for CNS HBs. Eleven patients were already screened for VHL mutations and 3 patients deceased before the start of the study. From the remaining 42 patients, 24 were accepted to be enrolled in the study. Assessment of psychological impact of VHL genetic testing was performed by measuring anxiety levels, mood disorders, quality of life, and psychological consequences of genetic screening. Twenty-one of the enrolled 24 patients underwent VHL genetic testing and 12 patients came back for the communication of positive genetic results. The baseline psychological status did not differ between these 2 groups. Patients who attended the visit of communication of genetic results had similar anxiety levels compared to those who had not. Furthermore, they also experienced an improvement in the level of anxiety and two QoL dimension scores compared to their baseline status. In summary, there is no evidence of a negative psychosocial impact of VHL genetic testing in patients with a previous history of CNS HB. We, therefore, recommend the recall of patients who have not been previously screened.
