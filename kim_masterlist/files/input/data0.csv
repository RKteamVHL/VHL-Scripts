Frequently observed lesions were phaeochromocytoma (47%), retinal angiomas (36%), haemangioblastoma of the spine (36%), and haemangioblastoma of the brain (16%). Four patients developed renal cell carcinoma. VHL was symptomatic in 47% of subjects; 30% were asymptomatic despite the presence of at least one VHL related tumour and 23% of the carriers had no detectable VHL lesion. Of the 19 patients who had died (15%), 10 died of symptomatic VHL lesions. Overall penetrance by cumulative incidence functions is estimated at 48% by 35 years and 88% by 70 years. ","A total of 125 eligible subjects with germline c. 292T>C (authors used c.505T>C in the paper) mutation living in the district of Freiburg in Southern Germany underwent ophthalmoscopy and gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, the spinal cord, and the abdomen to assess for VHL lesions. 64 out of the 125 subjects subjects were from 15 branches of the previously reported Black Forest family. Other subjects include 10 probands and 51 of their first-degree relatives who are also mutation carriers. Of the 125 sugjects, 96 (77%) had clinical manifestations of VHL. VHL was symptomatic in 47% of the patients, 30% were asymptomatic despite the presence of at least one VHL related tumour, and 23% of the subjects had no detectable VHL lesions. Estimation by cumulative incidence functions showed an overall VHL penetrance of 48% by the age of 35 and 88% by the age of 70, whereas estimation among symptomatic mutation carriers showed a penetrance of 30% by the age of 35 and 55% by the age of 70. There were no differences between males and females in the manifestation of single tumours or the overall penetrance of VHL. Among the 118 subjects with well documented adrenal gland status, 55 (47%) subjects developed phaeochromocytoma during their lifetime. Other frequent lesions were retinal angioma (36%), haemangioblastoma of the spine (36%), and, to a lesser extent, haemangioblastoma of the brain (16%). 4 patients developed renal clear cell carcinoma. 1 patient developed pancreatic islet cell tumour and pituitary adenoma. 1 patient developed small cell lung cancer. 2 patients developed testicular teratoma.
