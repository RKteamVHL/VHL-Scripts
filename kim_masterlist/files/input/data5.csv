High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes by standard protocols. Mutation scanning of the VHL gene for identification of point- or small-size mutations was conducted on the entire coding sequence and intron–exon boundaries by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, denaturating high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and direct sequence analysis.

Abdominal contrast enhancement CT showed multiple lesions in the liver, pancreas and posterior peritoneum. The cerebellar tumor nodes were removed surgically and a diagnosis of hemangioblastoma was confirmed though histological analysis. The tumors in the proband’s pancreatic tail and retroperitoneal space also were removed subsequently. Histological analysis indicated the tumors to be pancreatic islet cell tumor and phaeochromocytoma, respectively. The probands grandmother (I-1) was 79 years old upon examination and CT and MRI exams identified two occupying cystic nodes in her cerebellar vermis and brain stem space, which later were removed surgically. Histological exam indicated the tumors to be hemangioblastoma.The proband’s 53-year-old father (II-1) was admitted to the hospital for sudden loss of consciousness. Head CT scan revealed cystic lesions with bleeding at left cerebellopontine angle. The tumors were removed surgically and identified as hemangioblastoma in histological examinations.

In family 1, the proband (F1-II-1), a 31-year-old male patient, presented with headache, paroxysmal hypertension and dizzy spells in 2009 with a 4-year history. Ultrasound and MRI scans confirmed single masses, multiple tumors and multiple cysts in the right adrenal glands, bilateral kidney and pancreas, respectively. Right pheochromocytoma and multiple right renal cell carcinoma were confirmed by histopathological examination. In 2012, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral epididymal head multiple nodules. Bilateral epididymal tubercle resection was performed and epididymal papillary adenoma was confirmed by histopathological examination. Additionally, the patient's younger brother (F1-II-3, 30 years old) presented with multiple right renal masses, epididymal nodules and multiple pancreatic cysts. Radical right nephrectomy was performed and histopathological analysis revealed right RCC with hemorrhagic cyst. In family 1 they identified a heterozygous variant, c.233A>G (p.N78S), within exon 1 of the VHL gene in two affected cases and one clinically normal family member (F1-III-1, the proband's 5-year-old son). Peripheral blood samples were collected for mutation analysis of the RET proto-oncogene and VHL tumor suppressor gene. PCR amplification of all exons and the flanking splice junctions of RET and VHL was performed, followed by direct bidirectional DNA sequencing. One hundred unrelated controls with a similar ethnic background were also included in this study.

Patient patient I,1 (female patient) was found to have bilateral adrenal tumors (pheochromocytomas). She agreed to genetic analysis. Patient II,1 died in childbirth with the symptoms and signs of a hypertensive crisis. Whole body autopsy showed a left adrenal and an extraadrenal pheochromocytoma. The child died 1 day after birth from a cerebral hemorrhage (sex unknown). Patient II,3 (female patient) did not have the familial presentation as confirmed by her family doctor, she agreed to genetic analysis. Patient II,2 (female patient) was found to have bilateral pheochromocytomas. Patient II,4 was a male who presented with bilateral pheochromocytoma. His son, III,1, presented with a right-sided pheochromocytoma. Patient I,2 was a male presenting with right-sided pheochromocytoma. His daughter, II,5, presented with bilateral pheochromocytoma. The family had age of evaluation at 14, 20, 29, 42, 45, 59, and 71 years old, but the patent information was not matched to the ages mentioned. ACMG evidence codes: 'flag for PM2' since the mutation was not found in the single nucleotide polymorphism database, but should have an up to date check preformed, ‘PP1’ because there is co-segreggation of the variant with VHL disease in the family. RET point mutations in genomic DNA of the family members were tested at codons 609,611,618,620, and 634 in exons 10 and 11, respectively. Furthermore, no mutations were found in exon 16 (codon 918). Examination of the vHL gene identified a reported C to G transversion at nucleotide 775 of the published coding sequence. This sequence change was predicted to cause a substitution of a leucine by a valine at codon 259 in the putative vHL protein. This mutation is now reported as L188V (c.562C>G) corresponding to the NM_000551.3 transcript reference. The C775G change segregated with the disease and has not been detected in analysis of more than 400 normal vHL alleles.

An association of clear cell renal carcinoma development with a relatively high loss of structural stability in VHL protein missense mutations was discovered. VGL gene rearrangements were found in 8 patients. One patient with a VHL rearangement, had an age of onset of 30 years old and presented with Cerebellar Haemangioblastoma, billateral phaeochromocytoma and retinal hemangioblastomas. There was also a family history of broad ligament cysts and pancreatic cysts. In the next patient with a VHL rearrangement, they had an age of onset at 23 years old and presented with retinal hemangioblastomas, renal cyst, cerebellar  hemangioblastoma, unilateral phaeochromocytoma, billateral CCRC. The third patient mentioned in this paper with a chromosomal rearrangement had an age of onset at 58 years old and presented with pacreatic cyst, cerebellar hemangioblastomas, billateral CCRC, renal cyst. Their family history also included instances of retinal hemangioblastomas. The fourth patient with a VHL rearrangement had an age of onset of 39 years old and presented with cerebellar hemangioblastomas, unilateral phaeochromocytoma, renal cyst, pancreatic cyst. The 5th pathient with a VHL rearrangement had an age of onset of 30 years old and presented with cerebellar hemangioblastoma, endolymphatic sac tumor, The 6th patent has an age of onset of 12 years old and presented with cerebellar hemangioblastomas, unilateral CCRC, renal cyst, pancreatic cyst,  Epydidimal cysts. The 7th patient with a VHL rearrangement had an age of onset of 54 and presented with spinal hemangioblastomas, bilateral CCRC, Paraganglioma. The 8th patient had an age of onset of 44 years old and presented with cerebellar hemangioblastomas, Unilateral CCRC (patients F22, F28, F58, F39, F27, F45, F55, F58 respectivly). These rearrangements were discovered by a southern blot positive test. Using three different restriction enzymes, they found the eight families that had presented gross rearrangements along the VHL gene. A detailed map of the deleted segments could not be performed since all restriction assays were insufficient to define the VHL region that was lost.
