Three were related (family 1). The 7 year old male proband was diagnosed with malignant extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma of the left retroperitoneum with regional lymph node metastases and treated with resection of the primary tumor, lymphadenectomy, and chemotherapy. At age 9, he presented with a local reocurrance which was treated with resection and external radiotherapy of 20Gy. At age 13, he presented a right adrenal pheochromocytoma which was resected. At age 15 a left carotid body tumor was clinically detected and removed, but recurred at age 16 and again was resected. At age 17, a pheochromocytoma at the renal pelvis was diagnosed by MRI and resected. At age 18, he was disease free except for a lesion in the L1 vertebral body suggestive of hemangioma or pheochromocytoma. His mother was asymptomatic but had the mutation. His cousin had the mutation and presented with a pheochromocytoma. His aunt also had the mutation and a history of retinal hemangioblastomas. The fourth patient with this mutation, an unrelated 34 year old female, presented with no personal or family history of VHL and persistent pharyngeal discomfort. MRI demonstrated a 4cm tumor in the parapharyngeal space. The tumor was removed, and histology revealed a paraganglioma. Postoperatively, she had Horner’s syndrome and a transitory hypoglossal paresis. At age 46, bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma and a paraaortic paraganglioma were removed. Later, her niece was diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma, and her brother suffered from pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and retinal hemangioblastomas.
