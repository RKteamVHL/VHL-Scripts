The DNA was extracted using conventional methods. The proband, 26 years old female, underwent surgery at 11 years of age to resect a pheochromocytoma associated with hypertension. At age 18 years, she underwent further surgery to remove a pheochromocytoma in the contralateral adrenal gland and two concurrent paragangliomas of the abdominal aorta and urinary bladder. One year ago, she was also found to have a right-sided, extra-axial, 1.6-cm supratentorial frontal meningioma. The patient's father, now 51 years old, was found to have an angioma of the glans penis and had had surgery for a mandibular cyst and epididymal cystadenomas at age 43 years.
