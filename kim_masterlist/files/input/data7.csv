Review this paper, references 30-38 have pts with same mutation. Review p2p and paternal family","The authors evaluated a proband (male) with a heterozygous compound mutation p.Pro81Ser;p.Pro2Pro and early-onest renal cell carcinoma at 29Y old. Four family members on the maternal side tested positive as c.241C>T (p.Pro81Ser) carriers, with no VHL-related phenotypes. The proband's mother did have breast cancer at 34 Y old and was 52Y old at the time of the study. The proband had a 2Y old daughter with only the p.Pro2Pro mutation and no phenotypes. The paternal family members were not available for genetic testing, but members had the following phenotypes: father died at 56Y from bladder cancer in situ (he was a smoker), uncle died at 46Y from renal cell carcinoma (he was a smoker), aunt had cervix cancer at 46Y old, niece was 23Y old and born with one kindey, 2 other aunts (60Y and 52Y) had diabetes mellitus type 2, and grandma diead at 77Y from ventricular cancer. We are not able to tell if the p.Pro2Pro synonymous variant was de novo or inherited from the paternal side. The paper also looked at in silico analysis for the p.Pro81Ser mutation and found the variant was predicted as tolerated by SIFT, Mutation Taster and Polyphen but was predicted to affect the protein function by HOPE and Symphony. RCC tissue analysis from the proband revealed lack of pVHL expression in the tumor tissue.

A total of 291 patients from 115 different families were included for analysis. Seven unrelated probands were genetically confirmed with this familial mutation. The first proband was a male patient from family #71 who was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma at 27Y, multiple pancreatic lesions at 24Y, and pheochromocytoma at 24Y. His mother, of unknown age, was asymptomatic. The second proband was a female patient from family #72 who was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblastoma at 37Y, renal cell carcinoma at 37Y, multiple pancreatic lesions at 37Y, and pheochromocytoma at 39Y. Her father was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblastoma at age 65Y, renal cell carcinoma at 54Y, and multiple pancreatic lesions at 67Y. Her first sister, who was not genetically confirmed with the mutation, was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblastoma at 22Y. Her second sister was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblastoma at 39Y and multiple pancreatic lesions at 36Y. Her third sister was diagnosed with retinal angioma at 34Y and multuple pancreatic lesions at 32Y. The third proband was a female from family #73 who was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblatoma at 26Y and retinal angioma at 13Y. Her mother was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblastoma at 38Y, retinal angioma at 25Y, and multiple pancreatic lesions at 52Y. The fourth proband was a female from family #74 who was diagnosed witmale h CNS hemangioblastoma at 16Y. Her mother was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at 36Y. The fifth proband was a male from family #75 diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at 32Y. The sixth proband was a male from family #76 who was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at 26Y. His father, who was not genetically confirmed with the mutation, was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at 64Y. His uncle, who was not genetically confirmed for the mutation, was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at 53Y. His cousin (son of uncle) was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma at 36Y and pheochromocytoma at 36Y. The seventh proband was a female from family #77 who was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblastoma at 25Y. Her mother, who was not genetically confirmed with the mutation, was diagnosed with CNS haemangioblastoma at 51Y, pancreatic lesions at 46Y, and pheochromocytoma at 25Y. Her first aunt, who was not genetically confirmed with the mutation, was diagnosed with CNS hemangioblastoma at 27Y. Her cousin (daughter of first aunt), who was not genetically confirmed with the mutation, was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at 31Y. The grandson of her first aunt, who was not genetically confirmed with the mutation, was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at 9Y. Her second aunt, who was not genetically confirmed with the mutation, was diagnosed with CNS haemangioblastoma at 43Y, renal cell carcinoma at 36Y, and multiple pancreatic lesions at 48Y.
