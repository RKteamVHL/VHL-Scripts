N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is the major renal cancer gene in adults. The mechanism of renal tumor suppression by VHL protein is only partly elucidated. VHL loss increases expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha transcription factors. However, clinical and biochemical data indicate that the hypoxia-inducible factors are necessary but not sufficient for renal tumorigenesis, which suggests other VHL effector pathways are involved. Jade-1 protein interacts strongly with VHL and is most highly expressed in renal proximal tubules, precursor cells of renal cancer. Short-lived Jade-1 protein contains plant homeodomain (PHD) and candidate PEST degradation motifs and is substantially stabilized by VHL. The effect of VHL on Jade-1 protein abundance and relative protein stability was further examined in immunoblots and metabolic labeling experiments using two time points. VHL-Jade-1 binding was tested in coimmunoprecipitations. In cotransfection studies with wild-type VHL, the Jade-1 PHD-extended PHD module, not the candidate PEST domain, was required for full VHL-mediated stabilization. This module is also found in leukemia transcription factors AF10 and AF17, as well as closely related Jade-like proteins, which suggests all might be VHL regulated. Intriguingly, naturally occurring truncations and mutations of VHL affected wild-type Jade-1 binding and stabilization. Although the VHL beta domain was sufficient for Jade-1 binding, both the alpha and beta domains were required for Jade-1 stabilization. Thus, truncating VHL mutations, which are severe and associated with renal cancer development, prevented Jade-1 stabilization. Moreover, well-controlled cotransfection and metabolic labeling experiments revealed that VHL missense mutations that cause VHL disease without renal cancer, such as Tyr98His and Tyr112His, stabilized Jade-1 fully. In contrast, like the VHL truncations, VHL missense mutations commonly associated with renal cancer, such as Leu118Pro or Arg167Trp, did not stabilize Jade-1 fully. Therefore, loss of Jade-1 stability may correlate with renal cancer risk. Endogenous Jade-1 in stable renal cancer lines also exhibited VHL mutation-dependent regulation. As in the cotransfections, VHL truncations did not increase endogenous Jade-1 abundance, whereas the VHL missense mutations tested partially increased Jade-1 expression. Additional studies with non-PHD proteins indicated that Jade-1 stabilization by VHL is highly specific. Fibronectin was not stabilized like Jade-1 by VHL, nor were candidate VHL interactors from a yeast screen. Thus, protein stabilization likely reflects the biological activity of largely intact VHL protein on the PHD-extended PHD module of Jade-1. Dysregulation of the VHL protein stabilization pathway or of Jade-1 itself may therefore contribute to VHL renal disease and renal cancer pathogenesis.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) affects 38,000 individuals in the U.S. yearly. Seventy-five percent of cases are clear-cell carcinomas, and a majority is driven by dysfunction of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. VHL loss of function and other non-VHL pathways leading to RCC share aberrant activation of the hypoxic response, such as upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and consequent neoangiogenesis. Metastatic RCC has been notoriously resistant to therapy. For decades, its treatment has been based on nephrectomy and limited use of toxic and often inefficient immunotherapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-alpha. However, new biologic agents are beginning to break the resistance barrier. Small-molecule multikinase inhibitors that target VEGF receptors (sunitinib and sorafenib) have a favorable toxicity profile and can prolong time to progression and preserve quality of life when used in newly diagnosed or previously treated patients. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab enhances the response rate and prolongs disease control when added to interferon-alpha. Temsirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, prolongs the survival duration of patients with poor-risk disease. Despite three new drugs being approved for RCC in the past 2 years, responses are mostly partial and of limited duration. Multiple new drugs and drug combinations are undergoing clinical trials and will likely impact the treatment of RCC in future years. Compounds found to be active in the metastatic setting are now being tried in earlier stage disease in an attempt to improve curability. However, no method has yet been validated to predict patient response to these newer treatments. [References: 99]

N2  - Loss of pVHL function, characteristic for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), causes increased expression of CXCR4 chemokine receptor, which triggers expression of metastasis-associated MMP27MMP9 in different human cancers. The impact of pVHL on MMP2/MMP9 expression and their relationship to CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 in ccRCC is unclear. By using reverse transcription PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, strong mRNA and protein expression of CXCR4, CXCL12, MMP2, MMP9 and MMP inhibitors TIMP1 and TIMP2 was found in VHL-null 786-O ccRCC cells. Loss of CXCR4/CXCL12 expression after restoration of VHL function in these cells was accompanied by a significant reduction of MMP2 and MMP9 expression, whereas neither TIMP1 nor TIMP2 expression was affected. Using real-time PCR analysis, higher MMP2 (p = 0.0134) and MMP9 (p = 0.067) mRNA expression levels were detected in primary ccRCC with strong CXCR4 compared to cases with weak CXCR4 expression. There was no association between CXCR4 and TIMP1 or TIMP2 mRNA expression. MMP2 protein expression data obtained by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray uncovered positive cytoplasmic staining in 290/380 (76%) primary ccRCCs. Co-expression of CXCR4 and MMP2 was found in 282 of these tumours (74%). Our in vitro and in vivo data strongly indicate that pVHL coordinately regulates expression of metastasis-associated genes CXCR4/CXCL12 and MMP2/MMP9 but the exact molecular mechanism of this regulation remains to be determined. Co-expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12, as demonstrated in VHL-null 786-O cells, might enable ccRCC progression and metastatic dissemination by autocrine receptor stimulation, even in the absence of exogenous CXCL12.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein is the principal negative regulator of hypoxia sensing mediated by transcription factors. Mutations in exon 3 of the VHL gene lead to Chuvash (VHL<sup>R200W</sup>) and Croatian (VHL<sup>H191D</sup>) polycythemias. Here, we describe an infant of Bangladesh ethnicity with a novel homozygous VHL<sup>D126N</sup> mutation with congenital polycythemia and dramatically elevated erythropoietin (EPO) levels, who developed severe fatal pulmonary hypertension. In contrast to Chuvash polycythemia, erythroid progenitors (BFU-Es) did not reveal a marked EPO hypersensitivity. Further, NF-E2 and RUNX1 transcripts that correlate with BFU-Es EPO hypersensitivity in polycythemic mutations were not elevated. Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    	Kaelin, William G Veronica: no unique phenotype-genotype data
N2  - von Hippel-Lindau disease, which is characterized by an increased risk of hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas, is caused by inactivating mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. The VHL gene product, pVHL, has multiple functions, but the best documented, and the one most clearly linked to tumor development, relates to its role as the substrate recognition module of a ubiquitin ligase complex that targets hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for destruction. pVHL function is often compromised in sporadic kidney cancers, and inhibitors of the HIF-responsive growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor) are active against this disease. pVHL, by inhibiting atypical protein kinase C and hence JunB, also affects neuronal survival, as do the products of the other genes linked to familial pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (NF1, RET, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD). It is hypothesized that tumor-associated alleles of these genes allow primitive sympathoadrenal precursors to escape developmental culling, and that such cells are at increased risk of forming tumors.

N1  - Veronica: no phenotype-genotype data
N2  - Malignant tumours of the kidneys are relatively rare tumours that occur in adults, although there has been a constant increase in the incidence of this cancer type in recent years. It occupies the 10th place in terms of the number of new cases of cancer in men and 14th place in women. Considerable progress in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma over the last years has forced researchers to look for new factors of potential prognostic or predictive value in this tumour type in order to clarify the selection of patients for optimal treatment. The drugs from the group of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have played a decisive role. So far, the Motzer model, grouping the prognostic factors, has been most commonly used in clinical practice. Based on the current research looking for new markers of prognostic or predictive value, these factors can be divided into cellular hypoxia-induced proteins and proteins regulating the cell cycle and the apoptosis process. In the second part of this study, hypoxia-inducible factors will be discussed.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations of the VHL tumour suppressor gene. The VHL gene product, pVHL, forms multiprotein complexes that contain elongin B, elongin C and Cul-2, and negatively regulates hypoxia-inducible mRNAs. pVHL is suspected to play a role in ubiquitination given the similarity of elongin C and Cul-2 with Skp1 and Cdc53, respectively. pVHL can also interact with fibronectin and is required for the assembly of a fibronectin matrix. Finally, pVHL, at least indirectly, plays a role in the ability of cells to exit the cell cycle. Thus, pVHL is a tumour suppressor protein that regulates angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation and the cell cycle. [References: 45]

N2  - OBJECT: Research into the etiopathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms has failed to demonstrate molecular markers or pathognomonic genetic sequences. The authors describe the case of aneurysmal rupture in a patient with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome and explore a possible molecular link. METHODS: A 17-year-old girl underwent endovascular coiling for an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Six years later, she developed spinocerebellar hemangioblastomas. Gene sequencing revealed a heterozygous, germline point mutation at nucleotide 469 in the VHL locus on chromosome 3. The mutation changed a codon for proline (CCC) to one for serine (TCC) at amino acid position 86. CONCLUSIONS: The VHL tumor suppressor gene may be causally related to aneurysm formation through the effects of transcription factors, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases. Although a single point mutation is unlikely to be responsible for the complex phenotype of intracranial aneurysm, further research on aneurysmal domes and VHL gene expression may help validate the theory that extracellular matrix destruction is the final common pathway to aneurysm formation.

N2  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and tumour growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) are frequently overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) yet responses to single-agent EGFR inhibitors are uncommon. Although von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations are predominant, RCC also develops in individuals with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Tuberous sclerosis mutations activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and biochemically resemble VHL alterations. We found that RCC cell lines expressed EGFR mRNA in the near-absence of other ErbB family members. Combined EGFR and mTOR inhibition synergistically impaired growth in a VHL-dependent manner. Iressa blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation specifically in wt-VHL cells, whereas rapamycin inhibited phospho-RPS6 and 4E-BP1 irrespective of VHL. In contrast, phospho-AKT was resistant to these agents and MYC translation initiation (polysome binding) was similarly unaffected unless AKT was inhibited. Primary RCCs vs cell lines contained similar amounts of phospho-ERK1/2, much higher levels of ErbB-3, less phospho-AKT, and no evidence of phospho-RPS6, suggesting that mTOR activity was reduced. A subset of tumours and cell lines expressed elevated eIF4E in the absence of upstream activation. Despite similar amounts of EGFR mRNA, cell lines (vs tumours) overexpressed EGFR protein. In the paired cell lines, PRC3 and WT8, EGFR protein was elevated post-transcriptionally in the VHL mutant and EGF-stimulated phosphorylation was prolonged. We propose that combined EGFR and mTOR inhibitors may be useful in the subset of RCCs with wt-VHL. However, apparent differences between primary tumours and cell lines require further investigation.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the retinal function in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Patients: Studies were undertaken in 12 patients (17 eyes) with detected VHL gene mutation and 12 normal healthy controls (17 eyes). Methods: Pattern ERG (PERG), standard flash electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed in accordance with the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standards. Results: In VHL patients, electrophysiological statistically significant changes were found. In PERG examination, increased latency of P50 was found in the total VHL group (p < 0.02) and in the VHL subgroup with retinal angiomas (p < 0.04). In ERG examination, photopic b-wave latency was increased in the total VHL group (p < 0.03) and also in the VHL subgroup without retinal angiomas (p < 0.05). In OPs, latency increase of OP2, OP3 waves and reduced amplitude of OP3 wave in the total VHL group (OP2 latency, p < 0.05; OP3 latency, p < 0.01; OPS amplitude, p < 0.03) and in the VHL subgroup with retinal angiomas (OP2 latency, p < 0.02; OP3 latency, p < 0.008; OP3 amplitude, p < 0.02) were obtained. Conclusions: It can be hypothesized that dysfunction of the inner retinal layer is present in individuals with VHL disease even in patients without retinal angiomas.

Veronica: review
N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a commonly diagnosed and histologically diverse urologic malignancy. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is by far the most common, followed by the papillary and chromophobe subtypes. Sarcomatoid differentiation is a morphologic change that can be seen in all subtypes that typically portends a poor prognosis. In the past, treatment options for RCC were limited to cytokine-based therapy with a high-toxicity profile and low response rate. An increased understanding of the molecular basis of RCC has led to substantial improvement in treatment options in the form of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. A significant early discovery in RCC was frequent inactivation of the Von Hippel Lindau gene in ccRCC, which ultimately led to the development of vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Further genomic sequencing of ccRCC tumors has identified other common mutations including BAP-1, PBRM1, SETD2, and PIK3CA. Many recent studies have explored how these mutations can affect prognosis and response to treatment. Likewise, papillary RCC has also been studied at the molecular level, which has shown a high level of mutations in the MET gene; early clinical data suggest the utility of MET targeted therapy. Finally, regarding the rarer sarcomatoid tumors, mutations in TP53 and NF2 may be important to their development. As we continue to learn more about what drives RCC at the molecular level, treatment options for RCC patients are diversifying.

N2  - We recently identified a class of pyridyl aniline thiazoles (PAT) that displayed selective cytotoxicity for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells in vitro and in vivo. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were used to develop a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model that related VHL-selective potency to the three-dimensional arrangement of chemical features of the chemotype. We now report the further molecular alignment-guided exploration of the chemotype to discover potent and selective PAT analogues. The contribution of the central thiazole ring was explored using a series of five- and six-membered ring heterocyclic replacements to vary the electronic and steric interactions in the central unit. We also explored a positive steric CoMFA contour adjacent to the pyridyl ring using Pd-catalysed cross-coupling Suzuki-Miyaura, Sonogashira and nucleophilic displacement reactions to prepare of a series of aryl-, alkynyl-, alkoxy- and alkylamino-substituted pyridines, respectively. In vitro potency and selectivity were determined using paired RCC cell lines: the VHL-null cell line RCC4 and the VHL-positive cell line RCC4-VHL. Active analogues selectively induced autophagy in RCC4 cells. We have used the new SAR data to further develop the CoMFA model, and compared this to a 2D-QSAR method. Our progress towards realising the therapeutic potential of this chemotype as a targeted cytotoxic therapy for the treatment of RCC by exploiting the absence of the VHL tumour suppressor gene is reported.

Veronica: only protein mutation is given (not &quot;c.&quot; mutation)
N2  - The germ-line loss-of-function VHL(R200W) mutation is common in Chuvashia, Russia and occurs in other parts of the world. VHL(R200W) homozygotes have elevated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2 levels, increased hemoglobin concentration, propensity to thrombosis and early mortality. Because the mutation persists from an ancient origin, we hypothesized that there is a heterozygote advantage. Thirty-four VHL(R200W) heterozygotes and 44 controls over 35 years of age from Chuvashia, Russia were studied. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin less than 130 g/L in men and less than 120 g/L in women. Mild anemia was present in 15% of VHL(R200W) heterozygotes and 34% of controls without a mutated VHL allele. By multivariate logistic regression, the odds of anemia were reduced an estimated 5.6-fold in the VHL(R200W) heterozygotes compared to controls (95% confidence interval 1.4-22.7; P=0.017). In conclusion, heterozygosity for VHL(R200W) may provide protection from anemia; such protection could explain the persistence of this mutation.

N2  - Cell regulatory circuits integrate diverse, and sometimes conflicting, environmental cues to generate appropriate, condition-dependent responses. Here, we elucidate the components and mechanisms driving a protein-directed RNA switch in the 3'UTR of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. We describe a novel HILDA (hypoxia-inducible hnRNP L-DRBP76-hnRNP A2/B1) complex that coordinates a three-element RNA switch, enabling VEGFA mRNA translation during combined hypoxia and inflammation. In addition to binding the CA-rich element (CARE), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L regulates switch assembly and function. hnRNP L undergoes two previously unrecognized, condition-dependent posttranslational modifications: IFN-gamma induces prolyl hydroxylation and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated proteasomal degradation, whereas hypoxia stimulates hnRNP L phosphorylation at Tyr(359), inducing binding to hnRNP A2/B1, which stabilizes the protein. Also, phospho-hnRNP L recruits DRBP76 (double-stranded RNA binding protein 76) to the 3'UTR, where it binds an adjacent AU-rich stem-loop (AUSL) element, "flipping" the RNA switch by disrupting the GAIT (interferon-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) element, preventing GAIT complex binding, and driving robust VEGFA mRNA translation. The signal-dependent, HILDA complex coordinates the function of a trio of neighboring RNA elements, thereby regulating translation of VEGFA and potentially other mRNA targets. The VEGFA RNA switch might function to ensure appropriate angiogenesis and tissue oxygenation during conflicting signals from combined inflammation and hypoxia. We propose the VEGFA RNA switch as an archetype for signal-activated, protein-directed, multi-element RNA switches that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression in complex environments.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) has a key role in cellular responses to hypoxia, including the regulation of genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis and apoptosis. The alpha subunits of HIF are rapidly degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions, but are stabilized by hypoxia. Cobaltous ions or iron chelators mimic hypoxia, indicating that the stimuli may interact through effects on a ferroprotein oxygen sensor. Here we demonstrate a critical role for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene product pVHL in HIF-1 regulation. In VHL-defective cells, HIF alpha-subunits are constitutively stabilized and HIF-1 is activated. Re-expression of pVHL restored oxygen-dependent instability. pVHL and HIF alpha-subunits co-immunoprecipitate, and pVHL is present in the hypoxic HIF-1 DNA-binding complex. In cells exposed to iron chelation or cobaltous ions, HIF-1 is dissociated from pVHL. These findings indicate that the interaction between HIF-1 and pVHL is iron dependent, and that it is necessary for the oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF alpha-subunits. Thus, constitutive HIF-1 activation may underlie the angiogenic phenotype of VHL-associated tumours. The pVHL/HIF-1 interaction provides a new focus for understanding cellular oxygen sensing.

N2  - A glycolytic profile unifies a group of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PHEOs/PGLs) with distinct underlying gene defects, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB) mutations. Nevertheless, their tumor aggressiveness is distinct: PHEOs/PGLs metastasize rarely in VHL-, but frequently in SDHB-patients. To date, the molecular mechanisms causing the more aggressive phenotype in SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs remain largely unknown. Recently, however, an excellent model to study aggressive PHEOs (mouse tumor tissue (MTT) cells) has been developed from mouse PHEO cells (MPC). We employed this model for a proteomics based approach to identify changes characteristic for tumor aggressiveness, which we then explored in a homogeneous set of human SDHB- and VHL-PHEOs/PGLs. The increase of glucose transporter 1 in VHL, and of hexokinase 2 in VHL and SDHB, confirmed their glycolytic profile. In agreement with the cell model and in support of decoupling of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), SDHB tumors showed increased lactate dehydrogenase levels. In SDHB-PGLs OXPHOS complex activity was increased at complex III and, as expected, decreased at complex II. Moreover, protein and mRNA expression of all tested OXPHOS-related genes were higher in SDHB- than in VHL-derived tumors. Although there was no direct evidence for increased reactive oxygen species production, elevated superoxide dismutase 2 expression may reflect elevated oxidative stress in SDHB-derived PHEOs/PGLs. For the first time, we show that despite dysfunction in complex II and evidence for a glycolytic phenotype, the Warburg effect does not seem to fully apply to SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs with respect to decreased OXPHOS. In addition, we present evidence for increased LDHA and SOD2 expression in SDHB-PHEOs/PGLs, proteins that have been proposed as promising therapeutic targets in other cancers. This study provides new insight into pathogenic mechanisms in aggressive human PHEOs/PGLs, which may lead to identifying new diagnostic and prognostic markers in the near future.

N2  - Posttranslational histone modifications serve to store epigenetic information and control both nucleosome assembly and recruitment of non-histone proteins. Histone methylation occurs on arginine and lysine residues and is involved in the regulation of gene transcription. A dynamic control of these modifications is exerted by histone methyltransferases and the recently discovered histone demethylases. Here we show that the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1alpha binds to specific recognition sites in the genes encoding the jumonji family histone demethylases JMJD1A and JMJD2B and induces their expression. Accordingly, hypoxic cells express elevated levels of JMJD1A and JMJD2B mRNA and protein. Furthermore, we find increased expression of JMJD1A and JMJD2B in renal cancer cells that have lost the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein VHL and therefore display a deregulated expression of hypoxia-inducible factor. Studies on ectopically expressed JMJD1A and JMJD2B indicate that both proteins retain their histone lysine demethylase activity in hypoxia and thereby might impact the hypoxic gene expression program.

N2  - Inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) is a common event in clear cell renal carcinoma, which is the most common form of kidney cancer. pVHL performs many functions, including serving as the substrate recognition module of an ubiquitin ligase complex that targets the alpha subunits of the heterodimeric HIF transcription factor for proteasomal degradation. Deregulation of HIF2alpha appears to be a driving force in pVHL-defective clear cell renal carcinomas. In contrast, genetic and functional studies suggest that HIF1alpha serves as a tumor suppressor and is a likely target of the 14q deletions that are characteristic of this tumor type. Drugs that inhibit HIF2alpha, or its downstream targets such as VEGF, are in various stages of clinical testing. Indeed, clear cell renal carcinomas are exquisitely sensitive to VEGF deprivation and four VEGF inhibitors have now been approved for the treatment of this disease.

N2  - Congenital polycythemias have diverse etiologies, including mutations in the hypoxia sensing pathway leading to increased levels of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF) and erythropoietin. These include mutations of negative regulators of HIFs, such as germline von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene heterozygous mutations (Chuvash polycythemia), HIF-prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) gene mutations, and gain-of-function mutations of HIF-2-alpha (HIF2A) (exon 12). Mutation of the PHD2 gene in one family was associated with polycythemia and recurrent pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL) a neuroendocrine tumor commonly found in so called VHL tumor predisposition syndrome. Over the past two decades, we have studied six unrelated patients with sporadic congenital polycythemia who subsequently developed PHEO/PGLs without till now discernible molecular basis. We now report on these three patients, two with different tumor somatic codon A530 HIF2A mutations in exon 12 and one with germline mutation F374Y inherited from his mother, in a unique domain (exon 9) of HIF2A, all three cases later developed multiple recurrent neuroendocrine tumors and were subjects of our study.In search of species homology, codons F374 and A530 of the HIF2A are highly conserved among man, chimpanzee, mouse, horse, cattle, chicken and zebrafish, suggesting this serves an important function for the gene. These mutations were identified in the vicinity of the primary hydroxylation site (exon 12) and novel domain (exon 9) of the HIF2A protein which affects VHL protein binding, Functional studies of the HIF2A mutants shown that three HIF2A variants have increased half-life consistent with gain-of-function of the HIF2A due to disruption in the VHL binding to these mutant residues impairing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This results in increased transcription of genes downstream of HIF2A including erythropoietin. Further examination did not reveal any evidence of loss-of-heterozygosity, nor an additional mutation of HIF2A, or other HIF-pathway genes in their tumor tissues. The fact that two patients with polycythemia and PHEO/PGL had somatic and one germline HIF2A mutations, albeit at different locations, underscore the PHEO/PGL promoting potential of gain-of-function mutations of HIF2A that alone, either as somatic or germline mutations can contribute to, but are not sufficient for PHEO/PGL development but is sufficient for inducing polycythemic phenotype.

N2  - Background: Current large-scale cancer sequencing projects have identified large numbers of somatic mutations covering an increasing number of different cancer tissues and patients. However, the characterization of these mutations at the structural and functional level remains a challenge.Results: We present results from an analysis of the structural impact of frequent missense cancer mutations using an automated method. We find that inactivation of tumor suppressors in cancer correlates frequently with destabilizing mutations preferably in the core of the protein, while enhanced activity of oncogenes is often linked to specific mutations at functional sites. Furthermore, our results show that this alteration of oncogenic activity is often associated with mutations at ATP or GTP binding sites.Conclusions: With our findings we can confirm and statistically validate the hypotheses for the gain-of-function and loss-of-function mechanisms of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, respectively. We show that the distinct mutational patterns can potentially be used to pre-classify newly identified cancer-associated genes with yet unknown function. © 2011 Stehr et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Mutation of the VHL tumor suppressor is associated with the inherited von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) cancer syndrome and the majority of kidney cancers. VHL binds the ElonginC-ElonginB complex and regulates levels of hypoxia-inducible proteins. The structure of the ternary complex at 2.7 angstrom resolution shows two interfaces, one between VHL and ElonginC and another between ElonginC and ElonginB. Tumorigenic mutations frequently occur in a 35-residue domain of VHL responsible for ElonginC binding. A mutational patch on a separate domain of VHL indicates a second macromolecular binding site. The structure extends the similarities to the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex that targets proteins for degradation, supporting the hypothesis that VHL may function in an analogous pathway.

N2  - Functional genomics represents one of the most rapidly evolving fields of contemporary medical research. It is being more and more exploited in endocrinological research, as well, including studies on endocrine tumours. By comparing gene expression profiles of different tumour tissues or to their healthy counterparts, large amounts of information can be obtained that was unfeasible even until recently. There are only few data available on the pathogenesis of sporadic adrenal and pituitary tumours. Owing to recent studies applying functional genomics tools, novel genes were identified that could have pathogenetic relevance. Some of these genes may even be applicable in clinical practice, e.g. for the study of malignancy, determination of prognosis or the choice of therapy. In this short review, the authors attempt to present a synopsis of the possible applications of functional genomics in the field of endocrine tumours by summarizing recent studies on adrenal and pituitary tumours.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHLS) is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome arising from germ-line inactivation of the VHL gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. VHLS manifests in a myriad of hyper-vascular tumors of both benign and malignant nature. Incidence of VHLS is roughly 1 in 36,000 live births and has over 90% penetrance by the age of 65. Improved understanding of the natural history and biology of VHLS has led to the introduction of screening protocols, early interventions and improved treatments, all of which resulted in a substantially improved prognosis for this disease. Further details regardingvariegated molecular pathways and mechanisms ofVHLS are emerging with the subsequent advent of novel treatment protocols that are currently in clinical trials.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation of VHL gene. The incidence of the disease is one in 36,000 and its clinical manifestation is a familial occurrence of hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system and retina, renal cell cancer and pheochromocytoma. Cerebellar hemangioblastoma is the most frequent or sometimes the only abnormality observed in this syndrome. We present a family with von Hippel-Lindau disease in which four first degree relatives had a cerebellar hemangioblastoma. This neoplasm caused the death of two brothers aged 27 and 24 years old, respectively and their mother aged 62. The third son of this family was affected ten years ago, at the age of 30. The healthy family members are counselled in Oncological Genetic Outpatient Unit in Gdansk.

N1  - Pioli, P ARigby, W F Veronica: no reference to specific mutations
N2  - The product of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, pVHL, functions as a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase in regulating HIF-1 protein turnover, thus accounting for the increased transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes that accompanies VHL mutations. The increased vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA stability in cells lacking pVHL has been hypothesized to be due to a similar regulation of an RNA-binding protein. We report the expression of the GLUT-1 3'-untranslated region RNA-binding protein, heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2, is specifically increased in pVHL-deficient cell lines. Enhanced hnRNP A2 expression was apparent in all cell fractions, including polysomes, where a similar modest effect on hnRNP L (a GLUT-1 and VEGF 3'-untranslated region-binding protein), was seen. Steady state levels of hnRNP A2 mRNA were unaffected. Regulation of hnRNP A2 levels correlated with the ability of pVHL to bind elongin C. Proteasome inhibition of cells expressing wild type pVHL selectively increased cytoplasmic hnRNP A2 levels to that seen in pVHL-deficient cells. Finally, an in vivo interaction between pVHL and hnRNP A2 was demonstrated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data indicate that hnRNP A2 expression is regulated by pVHL in a manner that is dependent on elongin C interactions as well as functioning proteasomes.

N1  - Smith, Thomas GRobbins, Peter ARatcliffe, Peter J Veronica: no unique phenotype-genotype information
N2  - When humans are exposed to hypoxia, systemic and intracellular changes operate together to minimise hypoxic injury and restore adequate oxygenation. Emerging evidence indicates that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors plays a central regulatory role in these homeostatic changes at both the systemic and cellular levels. HIF was discovered through its action as the transcriptional activator of erythropoietin, and has subsequently been found to control intracellular hypoxic responses throughout the body. HIF is primarily regulated by specific prolyl hydroxylase-domain enzymes (PHDs) that initiate its degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (VHL). The oxygen and iron dependency of PHD activity accounts for regulation of the pathway by both cellular oxygen and iron status. Recent studies conducted in patients with rare genetic diseases have begun to uncover the wider importance of the PHD-VHL-HIF axis in systems-level human biology. These studies indicate that, in addition to regulating erythropoiesis, the system plays an important role in cardiopulmonary regulation. This article reviews our current understanding of the importance of HIF in human systems-level physiology, and is modelled around the classic physiological response to high-altitude hypoxia.

N2  - Less than 20 years ago, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene was discovered and associated with sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Since then, researchers and clinicians have labored to better understand the biology driving RCC tumor progression and provide means to predict patient survival and response to therapy. Studies surrounding VHL inactivation and downstream effects continue to provide insights into these areas. Besides studies of this primary pathway, cytogenetic studies, gene expression analyses, tissue microarrays, serum proteomics, genomic resequencing, and microRNA profiling have yielded greater understanding of RCC biology and clinical presentation, and have led to a rich understanding of the heterogeneity of this disease. We review the current state of research investigations into the molecular biology of RCC, and discuss the applications to currently used clinical prognostic nomograms. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Hereditary susceptibility to pheochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) represents a very complex genetic scenario. It has been reported that the absence of familial antecedents of the disease does not preclude the existence of a mutation affecting any of the five major susceptibility genes. In fact, 11-24% of apparently sporadic cases (without familial or syndromic antecedents) harbor an unexpected germline mutation, but we do not know what is happening in "truly apparently" sporadic patients (i.e., apparently sporadic cases diagnosed with only one tumor). In the present study, we have analyzed 135 apparently sporadic patients developing a single tumor for the five major susceptibility genes: VHL, RET, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. Fourteen percent of cases were found to harbor a germline mutation, and only 2.2% of patients were older than 45 years at onset. By taking into account the tumor location and a threshold age at onset of 45 years, we propose a rational scheme for genetic testing. Analyzing VHL and RET genes would be recommended only in young patients developing a single PCC. On the other hand, genetic testing of SDHD should be done in all patients developing an extra-adrenal tumor before the age of 45, and SDHC could be the responsible gene in cases developing a single head and neck tumor, independently of age. Finally, the analysis of SDHB should always be performed because of its association to malignancy and the low penetrance of mutations affecting this gene.

N2  - The radiographic findings and method of investigation are presented in the retrospective and prospective study of 221 descendents of an individual affected with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Among 42 affected individuals, most of the reported manifestations were found, such as cerebellar hemangioblastoma, retinal angioma, and renal cell carcinoma. A new manifestation, pancreatic carcinoma, was also seen. Although pheochromocytoma is common in some reported families, no cases were found in this group. An organized multidisciplinary approach is necessary to effectively identify and treat individuals affected with this disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal-dominant genetic disorder with variable penetrance characterized by multiorgan hemangioblastomas and a predisposition to carcinoma. CASE: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 35 weeks' gestation, with a family history of von Hippel-Lindau disease, presented with paraplegia caused by an acute intramedullary hemorrhage from a spinal hemangioma at the thoracic (T) 4-5 level. An unruptured hemangioblastoma was noted at the T7-8 level. A T3-6 laminectomy resulted in the improvement of symptoms. The postoperative period was complicated by autonomic dysreflexia and preterm labor. The woman was delivered by cesarean under epidural anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Pregnant patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease present problems related to hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system. Imaging studies of the central nervous system are mandatory for prompt recognition and treatment of complications related to intramedullary hemorrhage. If spinal hemangioblastomas are identified, cesarean delivery may be the most sensible choice.

N1  - Pasini, BStratakis, C A Veronica: no genotype-phenotype data
N2  - A genetic predisposition for paragangliomas and adrenal or extra-adrenal phaeochromocytomas was recognized years ago. Beside the well-known syndromes associated with an increased risk of adrenal phaeochromocytoma, Von Hippel Lindau disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and neurofibromatosis type 1, the study of inherited predisposition to head and neck paragangliomas led to the discovery of the novel 'paraganglioma-phaeochromocytoma syndrome' caused by germline mutations in three genes encoding subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme (SDHB, SDHC and SDHD) thus opening an unexpected connection between mitochondrial tumour suppressor genes and neural crest-derived cancers. Germline mutations in SDH genes are responsible for 6% and 9% of sporadic paragangliomas and phaeochromocytomas, respectively, 29% of paediatric cases, 38% of malignant tumours and more than 80% of familial aggregations of paraganglioma and phaeochromocytoma. The disease is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with a peculiar parent-of-origin effect for SDHD mutations. Life-time tumour risk seems higher than 70% with variable clinical manifestantions depending on the mutated gene. In this review we summarize the most recent knowledge about the role of SDH deficiency in tumorigenesis, the spectrum and prevalence of SDH mutations derived from several series of cases, the related clinical manifestantions including rare phenotypes, such as the association of paragangliomas with gastrointestinal stromal tumours and kidney cancers, and the biological hypotheses attempting to explain genotype to phenotype correlation.

N1  - Veronica: no phenotype-genotype data
N2  - The tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 functions in part as a caretaker in preserving the integrity of the genome, but also exhibits tissue-specific function by inhibiting estrogen receptor activity. Because estrogen (E2) induces a wide range of gene expression changes (by nongenomic and several transcriptiomal pathways), we sought to determine how comprehensive is the BRCA1-mediated inhibition of E2-induced gene expression alterations. Using cDNA-spotted microarrays, we identified a relatively large number of gene expression alterations (both increased and decreased expression) in MCF-7 cells caused by E2, some of which have been reported in previous studies. However, in the presence of exogenous wild-type BRCA1 (wtBRCA1), the response to E2 was severely blunted, with only about 10% the number of gene expression changes as that found in the absence of wtBRCA1. Examples of these findings were confirmed by semiquantitative and quantitative RT-PCR assays. In contrast to wtBRCA1, the induction by E2 of several E2-responsive genes was not inhibited by a full-length tumor-associated mutant BRCA1 protein [T300G (or <sup>61</sup>Cys->Gly)]. For three E2-responsive genes whose induction by E2 was inhibited by wtBRCA1, wtBRCA1 had little or no effect on the mRNA half-life in the presence of E2. Consistent with these findings, wtBRCA1 inhibited E2-stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells, but wtBRCA1 failed to inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 cells stimulated by IGF-I. Our findings suggest that BRCA1 globally inhibits the response to estrogen in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The implications of these findings for understanding how BRCA1 may act to restrain E2 action in vivo are considered. Copyright © 2005 by The Endocrine Society.

N1  - Anbalagan, SelvakumarPires, Isabel MBlick, ChristopherHill, Mark AFerguson, David J PChan, Denise AHammond, Ester M Veronica: in vitro study
N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For patients diagnosed with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), there are few therapeutic options. Radiation therapy is predominantly used to treat metastasis and has not proven effective in the adjuvant setting for renal cancer. Furthermore, RCC is resistant to standard cytotoxic chemotherapies. Targeted anti-angiogenics are the standard of care for RCC but are not curative. Newer agents, such as mTOR inhibitors and others that induce autophagy, have shown great promise for treating RCC. Here, we investigate the potential use of the small molecule STF-62247 to modulate radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using RCC cell lines, we evaluate sensitivity to radiation in addition to agents that induce autophagic cell death by clonogenic survival assays. Furthermore, these were also tested under physiological oxygen levels. RESULTS: STF-62247 specifically induces autophagic cell death in cells that have lost VHL, an essential mutation in the development of RCC. Treatment with STF-62247 did not alter cell cycle progression but when combined with radiation increased cell killing under oxic and hypoxic/physiological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the possibility of combining targeted therapeutics such as STF-62247 or temsirolimus with radiation to reduce the reliance on partial or full nephrectomy and improve patient prognosis.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma with prominent smooth muscle stroma is a rare neoplasm composed of an admixture of epithelial cell with clear cytoplasm arranged in small nest and tubular structures and a stroma composed of smooth muscle. In the epithelial component, loss of chromosome 3p detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been reported and on this basis these neoplasms have been viewed as variants of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. To test the validity of this classification, we have evaluated the chromosome 3 and VHL status of three of these tumors using FISH, array comparative genomic hybridization, gene sequencing, and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis. None of the tumors showed deletion of chromosome 3p, VHL mutation, a significant VHL methylation, or changes in VHL copy number and all three tumors demonstrated a flat profile in the comparative genomic hybridization analysis. We conclude that renal cell carcinoma with smooth muscle stroma should be considered as an entity distinct from clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

Veronica: no genotype-phenotype data
N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene encodes a protein consisting of 213 amino acid residues with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (pVHL30). Here we show that cells also produce a VHL protein (pVHL19) that appears to arise as a result of internal translation from the second methionine within the VHL ORF. pVHL30 resides primarily in the cytosol, with less amounts found in the nucleus or associated with cell membranes. In contrast pVHL19, in biochemical fractionation experiments, is equally distributed between the nucleus and cytosol and is not found in association with membranes. pVHL19, like pVHL30, can bind to elongin B, elongin C, and Hs-Cul2 in coimmunoprecipitation assays and can inhibit the production of hypoxia-inducible proteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and GLUT1 when reintroduced into renal carcinoma cells that lack a wild-type VHL allele. Thus, cells contain two biologically active VHL gene products.

N2  - In this study, we identified mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) in patients with sporadic clear cell renal carcinoma and analyzed the relationship between these VHL mutations and VHL protein (pVHL) expression levels. Analysis of VHL coding region mutations by direct polymerase chain reaction in 39 patients with clear cell renal carcinoma, who had all undergone radical nephrectomy, revealed heterozygous mutations in 7 (17.9%) of the 39 patients, including 2 novel mutations. Analysis of the levels of pVHL expression in tumor tissue samples from the 7 patients with mutations by Western blot analysis demonstrated that pVHL was not expressed in 3 patients, and that 3 subjects expressed about 50%, and 1 was similar to the normal level. These results suggest that the 3 patients who did not express pVHL had both mutation and loss of heterozygosity, and that the 3 patients who expressed about 50% of the normal pVHL level had heterozygous mutations.

N2  - Twenty-seven renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) found in one family affected with von Hippel-Lindau disease were examined using ultrasound (US), CT, MRI and angiography. The sensitivity of the tumor detection using different imaging modalities was evaluated by macroscopic pathology (solid or cystic) and size (exceeding 2cm in diameter or not). In 18 of the RCC's exceeding 2cm in diameter (eight solid and ten cystic), all lesions were detected on US, CT, and MRI. However, on angiography, solid RCCs were detected in 88%, and cystic RCCs were detected in 60%. In nine RCCs less than 2cm in diameter (seven solid and two cystic), solid RCCs were detected in 86% on US, 86% on CT, 80% on MRI, and 43% on angiography, but cystic RCCs were detected in 50% on only CT and MRI. From the pathologic correlation, even renal simple cystic lesions in VHL are considered premalignant lesions and they had better be removed if the residual renal function after surgery is preserved. In case of the observation, they should be followed carefully using thin slice thickness dynamic CT to discover the wall irregularity, septation and irregular contour.

N2  - We present a case report of von Hippel-Lindau disease associated with renal cell carcinoma and bilateral cystadenoma of the epididymis. A 26-year-old man appeared with painless tumors of the bilateral scrotal contents. Ultrasonography and other radiographic examinations including computed tomographic scan and dripinfusion pyelography showed multiocular tumors in the bilateral epididymis and a right renal tumor 3 cm in diameter. The tumors of the bilateral epididymis were surgically resected and of the right renal tumor enucleated. Histopathological examination revealed cystadenoma of the epididymis and renal cell carcinoma (clear cell carcinoma, G1, pT1a). He has not received adjuvant therapy, and is doing well with no evidence of metastatic disease 2 years after surgery.

N2  - Endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs) occur sporadically or in association with an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. In VHL disease, a germline mutation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is inherited, and loss of function of the wild-type allele occurs through genetic deletion with subsequent development of neoplastic growth. Genetic alterations associated with sporadic ELSTs are less well understood. In this study, we used tissue microdissection to selectively analyze neoplastic cells from four sporadic ELSTs. In two cases, we detected somatic mutations involving VHL gene exons 1 and 2, respectively. Additionally, one of these cases revealed deletion of the VHL gene locus. Two cases did not reveal VHL gene mutation; one of these two cases showed VHL gene deletion. These results suggest that mutations and allelic deletions of the VHL tumor suppressor gene play a role in the tumorigenesis of sporadic ELSTs.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma is a rare but important tumor of chromaffin cells that is frequently considered in the evaluation of hypertension, arrhythmias, or panic disorder and in the follow-up of patients with particular genetic diseases. This report provides an update about the genetics, neurochemical diagnosis, localization by imaging, and surgical management of pheochromocytoma. Specific mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause familial predisposition to pheochromocytoma in multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, and mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene cause familial disposition to pheochromocytoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease. Recent findings demonstrating extraordinarily high sensitivity of plasma levels of metanephrines for detecting pheochromocytoma have led to an algorithm for clinical diagnostic steps. Nuclear imaging approaches, such as(123) I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and 6-[(18) F]fluorodopamine positron emission tomography, enhance both diagnosis and localization of the tumor, as described in an algorithm for patients with positive biochemical test results. Since pheochromocytoma is often benign, surgical resection by laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be curative. Areas requiring further work include determining appropriate follow-up of patients with familial pheochromocytoma, elucidating the bases for phenotypic differences, improving both specificity and sensitivity of biochemical tests, optimizing cost-effectiveness of diagnostic imaging, and testing the risk for tumor recurrence after partial adrenalectomy.

N2  - Inactivating mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene are associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (VHL-/- RCC), the most frequent malignancy of the human kidney. The VHL protein targets the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor for ubiquitination and degradation. VHL-/- RCC cells fail to degrade HIF resulting in the constitutive activation of its target genes, a process that is required for tumorigenesis. We recently reported that HIF activates the transforming growth factor-alpha/epidermal growth factor receptor (TGF-alpha/EGFR) pathway in VHL-defective RCC cells. Here, we show that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of EGFR is sufficient to abolish HIF-dependent tumorigenesis in multiple VHL-/- RCC cell lines. The 2alpha form of HIF (HIF-2alpha), but not HIF-1alpha, drives in vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis of VHL-/- RCC cells by specifically activating the TGF-alpha/EGFR pathway. Transient incubation of VHL-/- RCC cell lines with small interfering RNA directed against EGFR prevents autonomous growth in two-dimensional culture as well as the ability of these cells to form dense spheroids in a three-dimensional in vitro tumor assay. Stable expression of shRNA against EGFR does not alter characteristics associated with VHL loss including constitutive production of HIF targets and defects in fibronectin deposition. In spite of this, silencing of EGFR efficiently abolishes in vivo tumor growth of VHL loss RCC cells. These data identify EGFR as a critical determinant of HIF-2alpha-dependent tumorigenesis and show at the molecular level that EGFR remains a credible target for therapeutic strategies against VHL-/- renal carcinoma.

N1  - Nakamura, EijiroKaelin, William G Jr Veronica: no novel genotype-phenotype data
N2  - Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare tumors derived from chromaffin cells. These tumors can arise in the context of hereditary cancer syndromes such as von Hippel- Lindau disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and neurofibromatosis 1. Recent studies indicate that germ line mutations of genes encoding specific succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits also predispose individuals to pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. This review focuses on the genetics of these tumors and suggests a possible link between familial pheochromocytomas/paraganglioma genes and control of neuronal apoptosis during embryological development.

N2  - Von Hippel Lindau disease (vHL), an autosomal dominant precancerous condition, had segregated in a large kindred. Fourteen relatives were known to have been affected; record reviews disclosed features of vHL in 15 previously undiagnosed relatives; presymptomatic evaluations detected vHL in 13 additional members of this kindred. Altogether, among 220 descendants of an ancestral couple, 41 had vHL. We screened for HLA haplotypes and for polymorphic gene markers at 31 loci in 102 direct descendants and 16 spouses from this kindred, including 23 with vHL. Linkage analyses failed to reveal a significant lod score with any locus tested, or any HLA linkage disequilibrium. Expression of vHL among the affected relatives was compared with 384 other reported cases of vHL. The age of onset, tissue involvement, and life expectancy in this family were similar to the other reported cases. The sigmoid age-of-onset distribution for vHL most closely matched a square-foot transformation (mean = 26.2(-2) years; variance = 1.224).

N2  - Aberrant microRNA expression has been implicated in the development of human cancers. Here, we investigated the oncogenic significance and function of miR-23b in glioma. We identified that the expression of miR-23b was elevated in both glioma samples and glioma cells, indicated by real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Down-regulation of miR-23b triggered growth inhibition, induced apoptosis, and suppressed invasion of glioma in vitro. Luciferase assay and Western blot analysis revealed that VHL is a direct target of miR-23b. Restoring expression of VHL inhibited glioma proliferation and invasion. Mechanistic investigation revealed that miR-23b deletion decreased HIF-1alpha/VEGF expression and suppressed beta-catenin/Tcf-4 transcription activity by targeting VHL. Furthermore, expression of VHL was inversely correlated with miR-23b in glioma samples and was predictive of patient survival in a retrospective analysis. Therefore, we demonstrated that downregulation of miR-23b suppressed tumor survival through targeting VHL, leading to the inhibition of beta-catenin/Tcf-4 and HIF-1alpha/VEGF signaling pathways. © The Author(s) 2012.

Veronica: placental cell culture
N2  - The von Hippel Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL) protein is essential for proper placental development and is downregulated in preeclampsia (PE), a devastating disorder of pregnancy typified by chronic hypoxia. To date, knowledge on VHL genetic and epigenetic regulation is restricted to inactivating mutations and loss-of-heterozygosity in renal cell carcinomas. Herein, we sought to examine whether VHL DNA is subject to differential methylation, and if so, whether it is altered in early-onset PE (E-PE). Sodium bisulfite modification and methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed that VHL is subject to extensive methylation in a CpG-rich region within its promoter in the human placenta. Notably, we detected significant differences in methylation in E-PE placentae relative to normotensive age-matched controls at key transcription factor binding sites, including that of the transcriptional repressor E2F4. Treatment of JEG3 cells with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, revealed that loss of DNA methylation promoted VHL transcription by attenuating VHL association with E2F4. RNAi knockdown of E2F4 in vitro confirmed its function on VHL repression. Exposure of JEG3 cells to transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) downregulated VHL mRNA. In line with elevated levels of TGFbeta3 in E-PE, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that E2F4-VHL association was enhanced upon TGFbeta3 treatment, indicative of VHL transcriptional inhibition. In line with decreased VHL expression in E-PE, augmented E2F4-VHL association was also observed in E-PE placental tissue relative to controls. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that hypomethylation of VHL DNA at a key transcription factor binding site has significant consequences for its transcriptional repression in early-onset preeclampsia.

N1  - Veronica: review
N2  - In the last years of the previous century the genes involved in the aetiology of five endocrine tumour syndromes have been identified. The tumour-suppressor gene that is responsible for Von Hippel-Lindau Disease was cloned in 1993; multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma were found to be caused by activating mutations in the ret proto-oncogene in 1993 and 1994, and most recently the menin-gene, another tumour-suppressor gene, was shown to be associated with MEN-1. As usual, the answer to one question leads to innumerable new questions. And so, now we want to know the extent to which germ-line mutations (de novo, or otherwise previously undetected) in these genes play a role in the occurrence of the various endocrine tumours that are associated with these syndromes in apparently sporadic cases. We also want to know if the nature of the (germ-line) mutation conveys any information about the characteristics (phenotype) of the disease. We want to know the role of somatic mutations in these genes in truly sporadic tumours. And finally we want to know the exact function of the proteins that are encoded by these genes. The paper by Roijers et al. elsewhere in this issue is an example of a small but well-directed step on the way to address some of these questions with respect to the menin-gene. It addresses the problem of patient selection when looking for germ-line mutations in apparently sporadic MEN-1 patients. In this review we want to give a brief summary of the present status with regard to some of the questions mentioned above, in relation to the endocrine tumour syndromes caused by the vhl, rct and menin genes.

N2  - Recently the gene responsible for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease was identified as a tumor suppressor gene. Our ongoing studies on the mutation of the VHL gene in Japanese 28 VHL families with single strand conformational analyses of DNA and Southern blot analyses revealed 6 cases of insertion or deletion, 1 cases of splice site mutation and 9 cases of missense mutation, and 3 possible intragenic deletions. Our analytical findings are essentially similar to those observed in the western countries. The VHL families associated with pheochromocytoma had the same mutational hot spot as those in the western countries. Molecular analyses of the VHL gene in the Japanese VHL disease substantially improved the understanding of this disease and its inheritance character.

N2  - The master switch of cellular hypoxia responses, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), is hydroxylated by factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) at a conserved asparagine residue under normoxia, which suppresses transcriptional activity of HIF-1 by abrogating its interaction with transcription coactivators. Here we report the crystal structure of human FIH-1 at 2.8-A resolution. The structural core of FIH-1 consists of a jellyroll-like beta-barrel containing the conserved ferrous-binding triad residues, confirming that FIH-1 is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. Except for the core structure and triad residues, FIH-1 has many structural deviations from other family members including N- and C-terminal insertions and various deletions in the middle of the structure. The ferrous-binding triad region is highly exposed to the solvent, which is connected to a prominent groove that may bind to a helix near the hydroxylation site of HIF-1. The structure, which is in a dimeric state, also reveals the putative von Hippel-Lindau-binding site that is distinctive to the putative HIF-1-binding site, supporting the formation of the ternary complex by FIH-1, HIF-1, and von Hippel-Lindau. The unique environment of the active site and cofactor-binding region revealed in the structure should allow design of selective drugs that can be used in ischemic diseases to promote hypoxia responses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene encodes two mRNA variants. Variant 1 encodes two protein isoforms, pVHL213 and pVHL160, that have been extensively documented in the literature. Variant 2 is produced by alternative splicing of exon 2 and encodes a pVHL isoform of 172 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 19kDa (pVHL172), the expression of which has never been demonstrated so far due to the absence of suitable antibodies. METHODS: We have generated an anti-pVHL monoclonal antibody (JD-1956) using pVHL172 recombinant protein. We tested the antibody against exogenous or endogenous expressed proteins in different cell lines. We identified the pVHL172 using a silencing RNA strategy. The epitope of the antibody was mapped using a peptide array. RESULTS: We efficiently detected the three different isoforms of pVHL in cell lines and tumorigenic tissues by western blotting and immunohistochemistry and confirmed for the first time the endogenous expression of pVHL172. CONCLUSIONS: The endogenous expression of the three isoforms and particularly the pVHL172 has never been shown before due to a lack of a highly specific antibody since none of the available commercial antibodies distinguish the three isoforms of pVHL in cells or in both normal and cancerous human tissues. Evidence of pVHL172 expression emphasises the need to further study its implication in renal tumorigenesis and VHL disease.

N2  - We describe the clinical and pathological features in nine members of a large British family with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Twenty living family members underwent detailed assessment for features of the disease, including retinal examination and computed tomography of the head and abdomen. The hospital records of three deceased family members were reviewed and detailed information about a fourth was obtained from members of the family. As a result of this study, three asymptomatic family members were found to have features of the disease and all three living affected family members were found to have additional features. Lesions discovered included retinal angiomas requiring treatment in four family members, one asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma and one asymptomatic pancreatic endocrine tumour. We also report the occurrence of a spermatic cord mesenchymal hamartoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease.

N2  - Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) leads to failure of proteolytic regulation of the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), constitutive upregulation of the HIF complex, and overexpression of HIF target genes. However, recent studies have indicated that in this setting, upregulation of the closely related HIF-alpha isoforms, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, have contrasting effects on tumour growth, and activate distinct sets of target genes. To pursue these findings, we sought to elucidate the mechanisms underlying target gene selectivity for HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation to probe binding to hypoxia response elements in vivo, and expression of chimaeric molecules bearing reciprocal domain exchanges between HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha molecules, we show that selective activation of HIF-alpha target gene expression is not dependent on selective DNA-binding at the target locus, but depends on non-equivalent C-terminal portions of these molecules. Our data indicate that post-DNA binding mechanisms that are dissimilar for HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha determine target gene selectivity in RCC cells.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although genetic abnormalities on 3p have been suggested to be linked to the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, to the authors' knowledge no study to date has examined such genetic abnormalities in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. In the current study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was evaluated at several loci within 3p, including the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL), in samples of tongue squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, the coding region of the intact VHL allele was screened for sequence mutations. METHODS: DNA was extracted from tumor and nontumor tissues collected from 28 patients with tongue squamous cell carcinoma. LOH was investigated by analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms within exon 3 of VHL and by microsatellite analysis within another 10 loci. Mutation analysis of the VHL gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the coding region of the gene. RESULTS: LOH within VHL was found at a high frequency (45.5%) within the tumor. However, mutations of the VHL gene were not detected in all tumor samples. LOH of other microsatellite markers on 3p was observed in 27.3% to 50% of tumor samples. Eleven (58%) of 19 samples that were informative at more than 2 loci exhibited LOH of at least 1 locus; 10 of these 11 cases exhibited LOH at multiple loci. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of deletions in 3p, including at the VHL gene, may play a role in the development of tongue cancer.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation occurs in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. The protein pVHL functions in a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1alpha for proteasomal degradation during normoxia. We establish that pVHL binds to Tat-binding protein-1 (TBP-1), a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome. TBP-1 associates with the beta-domain of pVHL and complexes with pVHL and Hif1alpha in vivo. Overexpression of TBP-1 promotes degradation of Hif1alpha in a pVHL-dependent manner that requires the ATPase domain of TBP-1. Blockade of TBP-1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) causes prolonged degradation kinetics of Hif1alpha. Several distinct mutations in exon 2 of VHL disrupt binding of pVHL to TBP-1. A pVHL mutant containing a P154L substitution coimmunoprecipitates with Hif1alpha but not TBP-1, and does not promote degradation of Hif1alpha. Thus, the ability of pVHL to degrade Hif1alpha depends in part on its interaction with TBP-1 and suggests a new mechanism for Hif1alpha stabilization in some pVHL-deficient tumors.

N2  - Aims. The von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor is a multifunctional protein. VHL mutations are common in sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Different mutation types may specifically alter pVHL functions, which have significant impact on gene expression and, consequently, on the disease outcome. The aim of this study was to identify gene expression signatures that correlate with specific VHL gene mutation types in RCC. Methods. Total RNA and genomic DNA were extracted from 94 frozen clear cell (ccRCC) and 21 papillary RCC (pRCC) specimens from the tumor biobank of Zurich University Hospital. Transcriptome analysis was performed using Affymetrix HG U133A gene chips. All ccRCC tumors were subjected to VHL gene mutation analysis. Results. By applying significance analysis of microarrays genes were identified, which were differentially regulated among the tumor subgroups. Hierarchical clustering based on the expression profile of the most differentially regulated genes resulted in a significant stratification between the two RCC populations. A total of 186 differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of ccRCC with VHL loss-of-function mutations and ccRCC with no gene alterations. Conclusions. The results clearly argue for a significant influence of VHL mutations on gene expression profiles in RCC. © 2008 Springer Medizin Verlag.

N2  - Although missense mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau disease (. VHL) gene are the most common germline mutation underlying this heritable cancer syndrome, the mechanism of tumorigenesis is unknown. We found a quantitative reduction of missense mutant VHL protein (pVHL) in tumors associated with physiologic mRNA expression. Although mutant pVHL is unstable and degraded contemporarily with translation, it retains its E3 ligase function, including hypoxia-inducible factor degradation. The premature pVHL degradation is due to misfolding and imbalance of chaperonin binding. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) can modulate this pathway by inhibiting the HDAC-Hsp90 chaperone axis, stabilizing pVHL, and restoring activity comparable to wild-type protein, both in vitro and in animal models. Furthermore, HDACI-mediated stabilization of missense pVHL significantly attenuates the growth of 786-O rodent tumor model. These findings provide direct biological insight into VHL-associated tumors and elucidate a treatment paradigm for VHL. © 2013 The Authors.

N2  - Patients diagnosed with von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) require life-long surveillance for this multi-system disease. It is therefore important to assess the comprehensiveness of screening provision, as well as identify what type of screening service is most likely to encourage regular patient attendance. This descriptive study reports on two types of screening service: single appointment One Stop (OS) clinics and multiple appointment Ad Hoc (AH) clinics. One hundred and seventeen vHL patients from eight regional genetics centres were approached to take part. Seventy-two (61.5%) returning a completed study questionnaire: fifty-four (75%) were screened at OS clinics and eighteen (25%) at AH clinics. Comprehensiveness of screening, attendance rates, patient ratings of quality of care and levels of psychological morbidity were compared between the two types of service. While levels of disease severity were similar in patients screened at OS and AH clinics, those seen at OS clinics were screened for twice as many site-specific vHL manifestations compared to those seen at AH clinics (P < 0.0001). More patients at OS clinics regularly attended their screening appointments compared to those at AH clinics (P = 0.0045). There was no difference in the quality of care reported by patients attending the two types of screening service and few problems were reported. Twenty-nine percent of respondents were categorised as clinically anxious and 13% as clinically depressed. These findings suggest that an optimum vHL screening service is one based on OS clinics offering regular comprehensive surveillance and psychological support.

N1  - Veronica: review
N2  - Under obese conditions, adipose tissue can become oxygen-deficient or hypoxic. Extensive work has been done using various diet-induced obesity models to demonstrate an important role of hypoxia-induced signaling in adipose tissue and its impact on adipose functions related to adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation. We have recently identified a new mechanism connecting activation of the hypoxia-sensing pathway manifested by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 2a to adipose tissue inflammation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, this observation is consistent with the clinical evidence showing that obesity is often associated with ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction as well as congestive heart failure independent of other well-established risk factors including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. This brief review will discuss the currently published genetic mouse models to determine the role of the HIF pathway in adipose tissue-associated diseases with a focus on the newly identified role of adipocyte HIF-2 in the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

N2  - AIMS: The vhl gene is a tumour suppressor gene implicated in renal tumorigenesis in both familial and sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Alterations in the gene may modify its suppressor function and allow the formation of renal tumours. The purpose of this study was to determine the existence of vhl gene mutations in renal tumour tissue among patients with sporadic RCC and to assess the effects on the structure of the VHL protein. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an observational, analytical and descriptive study of 96 patients who had undergone surgery for sporadic RCC. In surgical specimens of tumour tissue, the three exons of the vhl gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subjected to automatic sequencing. The consequences of the mutations detected on the VHL protein were analysed, taking into account the physical and chemical properties of the amino acids changed by the mutations, the location of the alterations in the protein sequence, the degree of conservation throughout evolution, and prediction of the secondary structure of the protein. RESULTS: In total, 22 vhl gene mutations were detected in 21 (21.9%) patients; in particular, 13 exonic point mutations consisting of 11 sense mutations, one silent mutation and one missense mutation, plus five exon deletions and one insertion. The remaining three were intronic mutations. All changes occurred in protein functional domains and in regions that have been well conserved throughout evolution. Two-thirds of the intronic mutations were considered relevant for protein function. Among the mutations detected, 72.7% were considered capable of compromising the VHL protein suppressor function. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the vhl gene result in amino acid changes in the protein that usually occur at important functional sites that have been conserved throughout evolution and where the binding domains for other proteins are located and exert their suppressor function.

N2  - Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences representing a substantial fraction of most genomes. Through the creation of new genes and functions, TEs are important elements of genome plasticity and evolution. However TE insertion in human genomes may be the cause of genetic dysfunction and alteration of gene expression contributing to cancer and other human diseases. Besides the chromosome rearrangements induced by TE repeats, this mini-review shows how gene expression may be altered following TE insertion, for example by the creation of new polyadenylation sites, by the creation of new exons (exonization), by exon skipping and by other modification of alternative splicing, and also by the alteration of regulatory sequences. hrough the I correlation between TE mobility and the methylation status of DNA, the importance of chromatin regulation is evident in several diseases. Finally this overview ends with a brief presentation of the use of TEs as biotechnology tools for insertional mutagenesis screening and gene therapy with DNA transposons.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau disease gene (VHL) is the causative gene for most adult renal cancers. However, the mechanism by which VHL protein functions as a renal tumor suppressor remains largely unknown. To identify low occupancy VHL protein partners with potential relevance to renal cancer, we screened a human kidney library against human VHL p30 using a yeast two-hybrid approach. Jade-1 (gene for Apoptosis and Differentiation in Epithelia) encodes a previously uncharacterized 64-kDa protein that interacts strongly with VHL protein and is most highly expressed in kidney. Jade-1 protein is short-lived and contains a candidate destabilizing (PEST) motif and plant homeodomains that are not required for the VHL interaction. Jade-1 is abundant in proximal tubule cells, which are clear-cell renal cancer precursors, and expression increases with differentiation. Jade-1 is expressed in cytoplasm and the nucleus diffusely and in speckles, where it partly colocalizes with VHL. VHL reintroduction into renal cancer cells increases endogenous Jade-1 protein abundance up to 10-fold. Furthermore, VHL increases Jade-1 protein half-life up to 3-fold. Thus, direct protein stabilization is identified as a new VHL function. Moreover, Jade-1 protein represents a novel candidate regulatory factor in VHL-mediated renal tumor suppression.

N2  - The clinical manifestations of von Hippel and von Hippel-Lindau's disease are illustrated. Four cases are presented with special emphasis on the angiographic characteristics, the evolution and the complications of the retinal capillary hemangiomas. Special attention is given to fundoscopy, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography and to the systemic manifestations. We summarize new molecular genetic insights. The importance of systemic and familial evaluation is stressed. Retinal angiomatosis is a clinical diagnosis but the angiography has an adjuvant value.

N2  - We have previously shown that human cullin-2 (Cul-2) is covalently modified at Lys-689 by NEDD8 (Wada, H., Yeh, E. T. H., and Kamitani, T. (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257, 100-105). Cul-2 has also been reported to form a multiprotein complex, Cul-2-VBC, with the von Hippel- Lindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL) and elongins B and C. In this study, using an in vivo coexpression system in COS cells, we show that NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2 is promoted by coexpression with wild-type pVHL and elongins B and C. Interestingly, tumorigenic mutants and deletion mutants of pVHL, which are unable to form a Cul-2 VBC complex, do not have the activity to promote NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. These results suggest that the complex formation is required for NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. Furthermore, we used a pVHL-deficient cell line, 786-0, to show that Cul-2 is poorly but clearly conjugated by NEDD8, indicating that pVHL is not the only molecule that promotes NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-2. Taken together, the VBC complex appears to have ligase activity in the conjugation of NEDD8 to Cul-2.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors in children arising from chromaffin cells of adrenal medullary or extra-adrenal paraganglionic tissue. The tumors are characterized by synthesis, metabolism, and secretion of catecholamines. The formerly used guidelines for pheochromocytoma have been changed by recent discoveries, implementation of new approaches, and understanding of biochemistry, genetics, imaging, pathophysiology, and nomenclature of these tumors. In children, pheochromocytomas are more frequently familial, extra-adrenal, bilateral, and multifocal than in adults. Because of a highly variable clinical presentation, pheochromocytoma is often referred to as the great mimic. Measurements of plasma or urinary fractionated metanephrines are recommended as first-line biochemical tests for diagnosis, with optimum diagnostic sensitivity to be preferred over specificity. In general, localization studies must be used secondary to clinical and biochemical evidence. Adequate preoperative treatment with alpha-blockade is mandatory, including for pheochromocytomas that do not secrete but only synthesize catecholamines. Because approximately 40% of pheochromocytomas in children have a hereditary basis, proper genetic testing should be performed, with appropriate implications for future follow-up and treatment options. The risk for development of malignant disease depends highly on the underlying mutation, which may also impact recommendations concerning screening and surgical or systemic treatment. This article reviews recent advances in biochemistry, genetics, and imaging and outlines recommendations for improved evaluation and treatment of children with benign or malignant pheochromocytomas. © IPNA 2008.

N2  - We report here the characterization of a new polymorphic locus (D3S1207), shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization to map to 3p26-pter. The distal region of chromosome 3 has been implicated in both von Hippel-Lindau and 3p deletion syndrome, lung, uterine, breast, testicular, and ovarian cancers, renal cell and nasopharyngeal carcinomas, mesotheliomas, and various haematological malignancies, yet relatively few polymorphic marker probes are well mapped within this region. The identification of this new probe will therefore be particularly useful for the study of these diseases.

N2  - CONTEXT: Von Hippel Lindau disease is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited multisystem disorder characterized by development of benign and malignant tumors. The abdominal manifestation of the syndrome are protean. Magnetic resonance plays an important role in identification of abdominal abnormalities and follow-up of lesions. OBJECTIVE: To describe magnetic resonance imaging findings and patterns of pancreatic and other principal abdominal manifestations in a series of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease patients and to review literature. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed abdominal magnetic resonance studies performed in 23 patients (10 males, 13 females) diagnosed of VHL. RESULTS: In all examined patients abdominal involvement was present. The pancreatic imaging findings detected were: unilocular cystic lesions (6/23: 26.1%); serous cystadenomas (11/23: 47.8%), including diffuse lesions (8/23: 34.8%); solid neuroendocrine tumors (8/23: 34.8%); cystic neuroendocrine tumors (1/23: 4.3%). The renal findings detected were: simple renal cysts (18/23: 78.3%); complex renal cysts (13/23: 56.5%), including benign lesions (10/23: 43.5%) and malignant lesions (3/23: 13.0%); renal carcinomas (11/23: 47.8%) and 5 of these (45.5%) were multiple and bilateral. Five patients (21.7%) presented pheochromocytoma (4 of these were bilateral; 80.0%) and 1 patient (4.3%) presented cystadenoma of the epididymis. CONCLUSIONS: In VHL disease patients, magnetic resonance imaging plays an essential role in the identification of pancreatic and other abdominal lesions, in their follow-up, in the screening of asymptomatic gene carriers, and in their long-term surveillance.

N2  - Fragile sites are nonrandom, heritable sites on chromosomes that can be induced to form gaps, breaks, and rearrangements under specific conditions. There is currently no established criterion to define a common fragile site. We applied seven published criteria to our data from three groups of subjects: (1) three pairs of like-sexed twins, (2) four unaffected von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) family members, and (3) six patients affected with VHL disease. Substantial differences were present in the numbers of sites considered positive by these criteria. While some of this variability can be attributed to technical factors, our data illustrate the problems in comparing results from different studies to assess the significance of fragile sites. A recently published criterion is based upon the Poisson distribution. We found this criterion to be flawed in its presentation, and furthermore, the Poisson distribution did not provide an adequate approximation to our data. We propose here an alternative approach based upon the negative binomial distribution.

N2  - Renal cancers account for approximately 3.6% of all malignances represented in men and 2.6% in women. It is estimated that the increase in incidence of renal cancers is about 2-4% per year. The causes of kidney cancer are believed to be environmental and genetic. It is estimated that about 4% of renal cancer are "hereditary cancers", thus due to high predisposition by constitutional genetic changes. The clinical hereditary forms of renal cancer are characterized by multifocal and generally bilateral tumours. Also vertical transmission has been observed. The age of diagnosis of patients with hereditary forms of renal cancer was younger than the age of patients with sporadic forms. Although to date there are over 20 syndromes described in which renal cell cancer may occur, only four syndromes with an unequivocal genetic predisposition to renal cell carcinoma have been identified: von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), hereditary clear cell carcinoma, hereditary papillary carcinoma (HPRC) and hereditary leiomyomatosis and papillary renal cell cancer syndrome (HLRCC). Most of them occur as a result of high monogenic predisposition. The advancement of molecular genetics will allow in the near future the identification of the polygenic background of cancer. The identification of a genetic predisposition to cancer has a great value because knowledge about the molecular basis of the carcinogenesis allows for a better understanding of the aetiology of the disease and also allows for the identification of individuals who are carriers of the mutations which means they are at risk of disease development.

N2  - Loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene function occurs in familial and most sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), resulting in the aberrant expression of genes that control cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. The molecular mechanisms by which VHL loss leads to tumorigenesis are not yet fully defined. VHL loss has been shown to allow robust RCC cell motility, invasiveness, and morphogenesis in response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation, processes that are known to contribute to tumor invasiveness and metastatic potential. Among the most likely intracellular mediators of these HGF-driven activities is beta-catenin, a structural link between cadherens and the actin cytoskeleton, as well as a gene transactivator. We show that reconstitution of VHL expression in RCC cells repressed HGF-stimulated beta-catenin tyrosyl phosphorylation, adherens junction disruption, cytoplasmic beta-catenin accumulation, and reporter gene transactivation in RCC cells. Ectopic expression of a ubiquitination-resistant beta-catenin mutant specifically restored HGF-stimulated invasion and morphogenesis in VHL-transfected RCC cells. VHL gene silencing in non-RCC renal epithelial cells phenotypically mimicked VHL loss in RCC, and HGF-driven invasiveness was blocked by the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Tcf. We conclude that, unlike many other cancers, where HGF pathway activation contributes to malignancy through the acquisition of autocrine signaling, receptor overexpression, or mutation, in RCC cells VHL loss enables HGF-driven oncogenic beta-catenin signaling. These findings identify beta-catenin as a potential target in biomarker and drug development for RCC.

N1  - Rechsteiner, Markus Pvon Teichman, AdrianaNowicka, AnnaSulser, TullioSchraml, PeterMoch, Holger Veronica: patient data not specific enough?
N2  - Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are frequent in clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Nonsense and frameshift mutations abrogate the function of the VHL protein (pVHL), whereas missense mutations can have different effects. To identify those missense mutations with functional consequences, we sequenced VHL in 256 sporadic ccRCC and identified 187 different VHL mutations of which 65 were missense mutations. Location and destabilizing effects of VHL missense mutations were determined in silico. The majority of the thermodynamically destabilizing missense mutations were located in exon 1 in the core of pVHL, whereas protein surface mutations in exon 3 affected the interaction domains of elongin B and C. Their impact on pVHL's functionality was further investigated in vitro by stably reintroducing VHL missense mutations into a VHL null cell line and by monitoring the green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals after the transfection of a hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)alpha-GFP expression vector. pVHL's functionality ranged from no effect to complete HIF stabilization. Interestingly, Asn78Ser, Asp121Tyr, and Val130Phe selectively influenced HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha degradation. In summary, we obtained three different groups of missense mutations: one with severe destabilization of pVHL; a second without destabilizing effects on pVHL but relevance for the interaction with HIFalpha, elongin B, and elongin C; and a third with pVHL functions comparable with wild type. We therefore conclude that the specific impact of missense mutations may help to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations and may explain responses of ccRCC patients to HIF-targeted therapies.

N1  - Veronica: no novel patient study
N2  - The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an inherited neoplasia syndrome caused by the inactivation of VHL tumor suppressor gene, and somatic mutation of this gene has been related to the development of sporadic clear cell renal carcinoma. The affected individuals are at higher risk for the development of tumor in other organs, which include pheochromocytomas, retinal angioma, pancreatic cysts, and CNS hemangioblastomas. The VHL mRNA encodes a protein (pVHL) that contains 213 amino acid residues which migrate with an apparent molecular weight of 24 to 30 kDa. The VHL gene protein has multiple functions that are linked to tumor suppression, but the best recognized and evidently linked to the development of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), as well as plays a role in targeting HIF for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Aberrations in VHL's function, either through mutation or promoter hypermethylation, lead to the accumulation of HIF, which will transcriptionally upregulate a sequence of hypoxia responsive genes, including epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and other proangiogenic factors, resulting in upregulated blood vessel growth, one of the prerequisites of a tumor. HIF plays a critical role in pVHL-defective tumor formation, raising the possibility that drugs directed against HIF or its downstream targets (such as vascular endothelial growth factor) may one day play a role in the treatment of RCC. Moreover, a number of drugs have been developed that target HIF-responsive gene products, many of these targeted therapies have demonstrated significant activity in kidney cancer clinical trials and signify substantive advances in the treatment of this disease. © 2011 International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

N1  - Tong, T Q TRohde, DPeter, S Veronica: review
N2  - A more profound understanding in the pathophysiological mechanism of renal cell cancer has led to a shift in the treatment approach. Traditionally, cytokines were the frontline drugs, but recently this has transitioned to drugs interacting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) related pathway. Sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, temsirolimus and everolimus have demonstrated clinical improvements in randomized trials. The purpose of this review is to summarise the current management of advanced RCC. [References: 39]

N2  - We report the case of a 21-year old woman presenting with high blood pressure and raised normetanephrine levels. Indium-111-pentetreotide single photon-emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging showing isolated tracer-uptake by a 2 cm tumor close to the costovertebral angle of the third thoracic vertebra. Thoracic surgery led to normalization of normetanephrine levels. Histological findings were consistent with the presence of a paraganglioma. Mutations in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, RET, SDHAF2, TMEM127, MAX, NF1, FH, MDH2, and EPAS1 were absent, but a heterozygous missense mutation, c.311G > T, was found in exon 1 of the von Hippel-Lindau gene, VHL, resulting in a glycine to valine substitution in the VHL protein at position 104, p.Gly104Val. This same mutation was found in both the mother and the 17-year old sister in whom a small retinal hemangioblastoma was also found. We diagnose an unusual functional mediastinal paraganglioma in this young patient with a germline VHL gene mutation, a mutation previously described as inducing polycythemia and/or pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma or retinal hemangioblastoma.

N2  - In this study, we presented an additional case of renal hemangioblastoma, which demonstrates PAX2 and focal CD10 expression. Histologically, the tumor consisted of sheets of oval or polygonal cells and a prominent vascular network. The tumor cells varied in size, and possessed pale or eosinophilic cytoplasm that sometimes contained sharply delineated fine vacuoles. The tumor cell nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli showed moderate nuclear atypia and pleomorphism. Focal areas of stromal hyalinization and sclerosis were detected. On account of its strong or moderate immunoreactivity for the a-inhibin, S100, NSE, and EGFR, the diagnosis of renal hemangioblastoma was established. For further evidence of VHL deficiency, the tumor was subjected to VHL sequence analysis of all three exons and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection for chromosome 3p deletion. None of the VHL gene mutations and chromosome 3p deletion was detected in the tumor. Because of several shared morphological and immunophenotypic features, renal hemangioblastoma may be underrecognized and should be included in the differential diagnosis of primary renal tumors, in particular clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The unexpected positive staining of PAX2 and CD10 in renal hemangioblastoma should be particular concerned. Using a combination of immunoprofile may be helpful to the differential diagnosis of these renal tumors.

N2  - The hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) subunit is activated in response to lack of oxygen. HIF-1alpha-specific prolyl hydroxylase and factor inhibiting HIF-1alpha (FIH-1) catalyze hydroxylation of the proline and asparagine residues of HIF-1alpha, respectively. The hydroxyproline then interacts with ubiquitin E3 ligase, the von Hippel-Lindau protein, leading to degradation of HIF-1alpha by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomes, while the hydroxylation of the asparagine residue prevents recruitment of the coactivator, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP), thereby decreasing the transactivation ability of HIF-1alpha. We found that the Zn-specific chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), enhances the activity of HIF-1alpha-proline hydroxylase 2 but the level of HIF-1alpha protein does not fall because TPEN also inhibits ubiquitination. Since the Zn chelator does not prevent FIH-1 from hydroxylating the asparagine residue of HIF-1alpha, its presence leads to the accumulation of HIF-1alpha that is both prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylated and is therefore nonfunctional. In hypoxic cells, TPEN also prevents HIF-1alpha from interacting with CBP, so reducing expression of HIF-1alpha target genes. As a result, Zn chelation causes the accumulation of nonfunctional HIF-1alpha protein in both normoxia and hypoxia. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene has been widely analyzed in many tumors. Early studies in animal tumors suggest that changes in VHL protein level and localization may be also important in tumorigenesis. In this study, we determined the role of VHL protein in human renal cell carcinomas. METHODS: Seventy-five human renal cell carcinomas, predominantly of clear cell type (60 of 75), were examined for VHL protein by immunohistochemistry. The level and pattern of protein expression were then compared to VHL mutations and tumor characteristics. RESULTS: An apparent decline of VHL level (positive in <50% of tumor cells) was observed in 49 (65%) tumors, a change more frequent than VHL mutations (28 of 75) (37%). In tumors, VHL was localized to the cytoplasm and/or the cell membrane. The occurrence of a predominantly membranous signal was significantly associated with missense mutations (9 of 14 tumors with missense mutations versus 14 of 61 tumors with no or nonmissense mutations, P = 0.0025) and tumor stage (23 of 60 tumors with stage TI versus 0 of 15 tumors with TII and TIII, P = 0.0034). CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of the role of VHL protein level and intracellular localization in tumorigenesis in humans.

N2  - There are several hereditary diseases that are a predisposition to early-onset tumors. These include syndromic conditions like neurofibromatosis 1 and 2, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia, and familial adenomatous polyposis; and conditions which are usually not possible to diagnose clinically in a single individual, such as Lynch syndrome and BRCA1/2. Understanding of the mortality in hereditary cancer predisposing diseases is important for developing effective disease treatment programs. A number of studies have been undertaken to investigate the genetic predictors, prevalence and incidence, and treatment outcomes of these diseases; however, the majority examine only the most common of these diseases (eg, neurofibromatosis or BRCA), or look into postoperative survival. The mortality of individuals who are diagnosed with one of these hereditary diseases remains an area for investigation. This review is the first to attempt identification of studies investigating life expectancy in hereditary diseases which predispose to early-onset tumors.

N2  - OBJECT: The optimal treatment for intramedullary spinal tumors is controversial, because both resection and conventional radiation therapy are associated with potential morbidity. Stereotactic radiosurgery can theoretically deliver highly conformal, high-dose radiation to surgically untreatable lesions while simultaneously mitigating radiation exposure to large portions of the spinal cord. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the authors' initial experience with frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for intramedullary spinal tumors. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2003, 10 intramedullary spinal tumors were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery at the authors' institution. Seven hemangioblastomas and three ependymomas were treated in four men and three women. These patients either had recurrent tumors, had undergone several previous surgeries, had medical contraindications to surgery, or had declined open resection. Conformal treatment planning delivered a prescribed dose of 1800 to 2500 cGy (mean 2100 cGy) to the lesions in one to three stages. No significant treatment-related complications have been recorded. The mean radiographic and clinical follow-up duration was 12 months (range 1-24 months). One ependymoma and two hemangioblastomas were smaller on follow-up neuroimaging. The remaining tumors were stable at the time of follow-up imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery for intramedullary spinal tumors is feasible and safe in selected cases and may prove to be another therapeutic option for these challenging lesions.

    	The Ubiquitin-Proteasome System. Veronica: no phenotype-genotype data
N2  - With the many processes and substrates targeted by the ubiquitin pathway, it is not surprising to find that aberrations in the system underlie, directly or indirectly, the pathogenesis of many diseases. While inactivation of a major enzyme such as E1 is obviously lethal, mutations in enzymes or in recognition motifs in substrates that do not affect vital pathways or that affect the involved process only partially may result in a broad array of phenotypes. Likewise, acquired changes in the activity of the system can also evolve into certain pathologies. The pathological states associated with the ubiquitin system can be classified into two groups: (a) those that result from loss of function-mutation in a ubiquitin system enzyme or in the recognition motif in the target substrate that lead to stabilization of certain proteins, and (b) those that result from gain of function-abnormal or accelerated degradation of the protein target. Studies that employ targeted inactivation of genes coding for specific ubiquitin system enzymes and substrates in animals can provide a more systematic view into the broad spectrum of pathologies that may result from aberrations in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Better understanding of the processes and identification of the components involved in the degradation of key regulatory proteins will lead to the development of mechanism-based drugs that will target specifically only the involved proteins. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The first congenital defect of hypoxia-sensing homozygosity for VHL 598C>T mutation was recently identified in Chuvash polycythemia. Subsequently, we found this mutation in 11 unrelated individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds. To address the question of whether the VHL 598C>T substitution occurred in a single founder or resulted from recurrent mutational events in human evolution, we performed haplotype analysis of 8 polymorphic markers covering 340 kb spanning the VHL gene on 101 subjects bearing the VHL 598C>T mutation, including 72 homozygotes (61 Chuvash and 11 non-Chuvash) and 29 heterozygotes (11 Chuvash and 18 non-Chuvash), and 447 healthy unrelated individuals from Chuvash and other ethnic groups. The differences in allele frequencies for each of the 8 markers between 447 healthy controls (598C) and 101 subjects bearing the 598T allele (P < 10(-7)) showed strong linkage disequilibrium. Haplotype analysis indicated a founder effect. We conclude that the VHL 598C>T mutation, the most common defect of congenital polycythemia yet found, was spread from a single founder 1,000 to 62,000 years ago.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome that is characterized by the development of multiple vascular tumors and is caused by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). Here we show that pVHL, through its beta-domain, binds directly to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), thereby targeting HIF for ubiquitination in an alpha-domain-dependent manner. This is the first function to be ascribed to the pVHL beta-domain. Furthermore, we provide the first direct evidence that pVHL has a function analogous to that of an F-box protein, namely, to recruit substrates to a ubiquitination machine. These results strengthen the link between overaccumulation of HIF and development of VHL disease.

N2  - Purpose: The median survival following surgical resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is currently <20 months. However, survival >=10 years is achieved by a small subset of patients who are defined as very long-term survivors (VLTS). The goal of this study was to determine whether specific genetic alterations in resected PDACs determined very long-term survival. Experimental Design: We sequenced the exomes of eight PDACs from patients who survived >=10 years. On the basis of the results of the exomic analysis, targeted sequencing of selected genes was performed in a series of 27 additional PDACs from VLTSs. Results: KRAS mutations were identifi ed in 33 of 35 cancers (94%) from VLTSs and represented the most prevalent alteration in our cohort. TP53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A mutations occurred in 69%, 26%, and 17%, respectively. Mutations in RNF43, which have been previously associated with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, were identifi ed in four of the 35 cancers (11%). Taken together, our data show no difference in somatic mutations in carcinomas from VLTSs compared with available data from PDACs unselected for survival. Comparison of clinicopathologic features between VLTSs and a matching control group demonstrated that younger age, earlier stage, well/moderate grade of differentiation, and negative resection margins were associated with VLTS. However, more advanced stage, poor grade, or nodal disease did not preclude long-term survival. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in most patients, somatic mutations in commonly mutated genes are unlikely to be the primary determinant of very long-term survival following surgical resection of PDAC.

N2  - Apart from neuroblastomas, adrenal tumors are exceedingly rare in children and young adults. In this age group, the vast majority of patients present with clinical signs associated with excess hormone production. The most common tumor to arise from the adrenal cortex is an adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Similar to the situation in adults, this tumor is frequently diagnosed at a late stage and carries a very poor prognosis. ACCs require extensive/aggressive local resection followed by mitotane chemotherapy. A multidisciplinary approach is essential, and these children should be referred to units that have previous experience in managing ACCs. International registries are an invaluable source for evidence-based care, and such collaborations should be further developed in the future. Pheochromocytomas are derived from the adrenal medulla and present with symptoms caused by high secretion of catecholamines. At least one-third of these children will be found to carry genetic mutations, most commonly the RET gene (MEN2 syndrome) or the VHL gene. Open radical adrenalectomy should be offered to children with adrenocortical cancers. For all other cases, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice. It is possible that the retroperitoneoscopic approach will gain increasing favor. The role of robotic adrenalectomy remains controversial. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The target of rapamycin (TOR) signal transduction network monitors intra- and extracellular conditions that favor cell growth. Research during the last decade has revealed a modular structure of the TOR signaling network. Each signaling module senses a particular set of signals from the cellular milieu and exerts regulatory control towards TOR activity. The TOR pathway responds to growth factor signals, nutrient availability, and cellular stresses like hypoxia and energy stress. The signaling modules and their molecular components constituting the TOR network are remarkably conserved in both sequence and function across species. In yeast, roundworms, flies, and mice, the TOR pathway has been shown to regulate lifespan. Correspondingly, genetic, dietary or pharmacological manipulation of individual signaling modules as well as TOR activity itself extends lifespan in these model organisms. We discuss the potential impact of manipulating TOR activity for human health and lifespan. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - We attempted to investigate the clinicopathological correlation of renal oncocytoma (RO) with renal vein extension. We identified seven ROs with extension into the branches of renal vein. The age of seven patients ranged from 61 to 82 years. Five cases were identified; incidentally, two patients had gross hematuria. After surgery, all patients were alive and free of tumors with follow-up of 1 to 5 years (mean=3.6). Oncocytomas measured from 2.2 to 7.5 cm. Renal vein extension was grossly suspected in 5/7 cases and histologically confirmed in all seven cases. Tumor cells were positive for cytokeratins, mitochondrial antigen, epithelial membrane antigen, and parvalbumin; 5/7 tumors were focally positive for cluster of differentiation 117. Ultrastructurally, the cytoplasm was packed by mitochondria. Molecular genetic analysis did not detect abnormal numbers of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 17, and XY by fluorescence in situ hybridization, loss of heterozygosity on 3p, and mutation of Von Hippel-Lindau gene in all cases. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis of two cases did not show any major genetic changes. Conclusions are: (1) renal oncocytomas may have intravascular extension to the branches of the renal vein; (2) renal oncocytomas with intravascular extension to the branches of the renal vein have the same morphological, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic findings as have their counterparts without evidence of intravascular invasion; (3) the absence of metastases suggests an overall benign behavior of this tumor, but this has to be substantiated by further studies with a long-term follow-up; (4) in a renal tumor with granular cytoplasm showing renal vein extension, it is necessary to carefully exclude renal cell carcinomas (RCC) such as chromophobe RCC, oncocytic variant of papillary RCC, and granular variant of clear cell RCC.

N2  - Reduced choroidal blood flow and tissue changes in the ageing human eye impair oxygen delivery to photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium. As a consequence, mild but chronic hypoxia may develop and disturb cell metabolism, function and ultimately survival, potentially contributing to retinal pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, we show that several hypoxia-inducible genes were expressed at higher levels in the aged human retina suggesting increased activity of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) during the physiological ageing process. To model chronically elevated HIF activity and investigate ensuing consequences for photoreceptors, we generated mice lacking von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein in rods. This activated HIF transcription factors and led to a slowly progressing retinal degeneration in the ageing mouse retina. Importantly, this process depended mainly on HIF1 with only a minor contribution of HIF2. A gene therapy approach using AAV-mediated RNA interference through an anti-Hif1a shRNA significantly mitigated the degeneration suggesting a potential intervention strategy that may be applicable to human patients.

N2  - Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is a newly discovered modulator of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) with various biological activities such as cell growth, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis. Thus, in the present study, the biological mechanisms of melatonin were elucidated in association with SPHK1 pathway in PC-3 prostate cancer cells under hypoxia. Melatonin inhibited the stability of HIF-1alpha in a time- and concentration- dependent manners. Also, melatonin decreased SPHK1 activity in PC-3 cells during hypoxia. Furthermore, melatonin suppressed AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) signaling pathway, which stabilizes HIF-1alpha via inhibition of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein. Consistently, siRNA-SPHK1 and sphingosine kinase inhibitor (SKI) effectively blocked the expression of HIF-1alpha, phospho-AKT and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in PC-3 cells under hypoxia, suggesting the role of SPHK1 in melatonin-inhibited HIF-1alpha accumulation. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acteylcysteine enhanced melatonin-inhibited HIF-1alpha expression and SPHK1 activity. Overall, our findings suggest that melatonin suppresses HIF-1alpha accumulation via inhibition of SPHK1 pathway and ROS generation in PC-3 cells under hypoxia.

N2  - Carcinogenesis represents a multistep process associated with accumulation of somatic mutations in the classes of genes that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis as well as DNA repair. Oncogenes, positive regulators of cell proliferation are activated during carcinogenesis. On the contrary, tumor suppressor genes, negative regulators of cell proliferation have to be inactivated. Mutations in genes that function in the maintenance of genomic stability are manifested by increase in the mutation rate in cancer cells that drive tumor progression. In general, on the basis of malignant transformation lies the abrogation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell apoptosis. The genetic mechanisms included in the transformation of normally acting genes comprise a wide spectrum of events, such as gene mutation, gene and chromosome rearrangement and gene amplification. Besides the role of somatic gene alteration in the development of sporadic cancer, germline mutations are the basis of a substantial number of inherited cancer syndromes. The future decades will be marked with the expansion of data exploiting cancer genetics, epigenetics and genomics into clinical practice. Consequently, translational cancer research should provide the generating of new targeted therapies, since individual molecular profiling of a patient's tumor should increase efficacy of conventional anticancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. © 2004 Zerbinis Medical Publications.

N2  - Mutations of Ceramide kinase-like (CERKL) gene are associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited degenerative eye disease. CERKL encodes an antioxidant protein which is critical to photoreceptor survival, its deficiency causes retinal degeneration as a result of oxidative damage. However, the regulation of CERKL in response to oxidative stress, and its contribution to photoreceptor survival remain unclear. pVHL, the substrate receptor of RING finger-type SCF like ECV ubiquitin ligase, binds and ubiquitinates a number of hydroxylated proteins for proteasomal degradation. Due to hydroxylated proteins which are modified by PHD1-3, pVHL dependent ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway is blocked by PHD1-3 inhibitors (e.g. hypoxia or oxidative stress). In this study, we identified pVHL as an important regulator of CERKL. Western blot and in vivo ubiquitination assays showed hypoxia up-regulates CERKL at protein level by down-regulating its poly-ubiquitination. By Co-IP and domain mapping studies, we found CERKL complexes with ECV ligase via pVHL. Through overexpression and small RNA interference analysis, we demonstrated pVHL ubiquitinates CERKL for proteasomal degradation. Additionally, our work showed that the oxygen sensors PHD1 and PHD3 are involved in CERKL degradation. Collectively, our results indicated that pVHL interacts with CERKL and ubiquitinates it for oxygen dependent proteasomal degradation.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder, predisposing to the development of central nervous system (CNS) and retinal hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinoma and/or renal cysts, pheochromocytomas, pancreatic cysts and/or tumors. Incidence of the disease is 1/36.000. CNS hemangioblastomas and renal cell carcinoma are the main causes of death. The VHL gene, located on 3p25-26, is a tumor- suppressor gene which plays a major role in regulation of VEGF expression. Germline mutations of the VHL gene are identified in about 70-99 % of the patients. Mutations associated with VHL type 2 (with pheochromocytoma) are mainly, missense mutations with hot-spot at codon 167. Somatic mutations of the VHL gene are found in both sporadic central nervous system hemangioblastomas and sporadic renal cell carcinoma. For endocrinologists search for VHL disease (as for MEN) should be imperative in presence of a patient with pheochromocytoma and neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor.

N2  - The primary cilium is a highly conserved cell organelle that is closely connected to processes involved in cell patterning and replication. Amongst their many functions, cilia act as "signal towers" through which cell-cell signaling cascades pass. Dysfunction of cilia or the myriad processes that are connected with cilium function can lead to disease. Due to the sheer number of cellular processes that at some point involve the primary cilium, the effects of misregulation are highly heterogeneous between different cell populations. However, because of the importance of primary cilia in the development, growth, patterning and orientation of cells and tissues, a common thread has emerged in which defective cilia can lead to disorganization, which can contribute to the growth of neoplasms, including cancer and pre-cancerous phenotypes. Because cilia are so vital for signaling during cell replication and the cell fate decisions that are important in childhood growth, symptoms often arise early in life. Here we review recent work connecting misregulation of the primary cilium with tumor formation in a variety of tissues in the developing body, with a particular focus on the syndromes in which classic tumor genes are mutated, including von Hippel-Lindau disease (OMIM 193300), adenomatous polyposis coli (OMIM 175100), tuberous sclerosis (OMIM 191100) and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (OMIM 135150). Timely diagnosis of these syndromes is essential for entry into appropriate screening protocols, which have been shown to effectively prolong life expectancy in these cohorts of patients.

N2  - Background: Patients with Chuvash polycythemia, (homozygosity for the R200W mutation in the von Hippel Lindau gene (VHL)), have elevated levels of hypoxia inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, often become iron-deficient secondary to phlebotomy, and have elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressure by echocardiography. The objectives of this study were to provide a comprehensive echocardiographic assessment of cardiovascular physiology and to identify clinical, hematologic and cardiovascular risk factors for elevation of tricuspid regurgitation velocity in children and adults with Chuvash polycythemia. Design and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study of 120 adult and pediatric VHL<sup>R200W</sup> homozygotes and 31 controls at outpatient facilities in Chuvashia, Russian Federation included echocardiography assessment of pulmonary artery pressure (tricuspid regurgitation velocity), cardiac volume, and systolic and diastolic function, as well as hematologic and clinical parameters. We determined the prevalence and risk factors for elevation of tricuspid regurgitation velocity in this population and its relationship to phlebotomy. Results: The age-adjusted mean +/- SE tricuspid regurgitation velocity was higher in VHL<sup>R200W</sup> homozy-gotes than controls with normal VHL alleles (2.5+/-0.03 vs. 2.3+/-0.05 m/sec, P=0.005). The age-adjusted left ventricular diastolic diameter (4.8+/-0.05 vs. 4.5+/-0.09 cm, P=0.005) and left atrial diameter (3.4+/-0.04 vs. 3.2+/-0.08 cm, P=0.011) were also greater in the VHL<sup>R200W</sup> homozygotes, consistent with increased blood volume, but the elevation in tricuspid regurgitation velocity persisted after adjustment for these variables. Among VHL<sup>R200W</sup> homozygotes, phlebotomy therapy was associated with lower serum ferritin concentration, and low ferritin independently predicted higher tricuspid regurgitation velocity (standardized beta=0.29; P=0.009). Conclusions: Children and adults with Chuvash polycythemia have higher estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, even after adjustment for echocardiography estimates of blood volume. Lower ferritin concentration, which is associated with phlebotomy, independently predicts higher tri-cuspid regurgitation velocity (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00495638). © 2012 Ferrata Storti Foundation.

N1  - Almeida, Madson QStratakis, Constantine A Veronica: no novel study
N2  - We present an update on molecular and clinical genetics of solid tumors associated with the various multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN) syndromes. MEN type 1 (MEN1) describes the association of pituitary, parathyroid, and pancreatic islet cell tumors with a variety of many other lesions. MEN type 2 (MEN2) conditions represent at least four different syndromes that associate pheochromocytoma with medullary thyroid carcinoma, hyperparathyroidism, and a number of other manifestations. Other pheochromocytoma-associated syndromes include von Hippel-Lindau disease; neurofibromatosis 1; the recently defined paraganglioma syndromes type 1, 3, and 4; Carney-Stratakis syndrome; and the Carney triad. Carney-Stratakis syndrome is characterized by the association of paragangliomas and familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In the Carney triad, patients can manifest gastrointestinal stromal tumors, lung chondroma, paraganglioma, adrenal adenoma and pheochromocytoma, esophageal leiomyoma, and other conditions. The Carney complex is yet another form of MEN that is characterized by skin tumors and pigmented lesions, myxomas, schwannomas, and various endocrine neoplasias.

N2  - The combined efforts of a number of investigators have led to the identification of the VHL gene, which appears to function as a tumor suppressor gene and is implicated in both sporadic and familial forms of RCC. These findings should increase our understanding of the molecular biology of this malignancy; however, there is much work to be done. Identification of the mechanism of inactivation of the VHL gene, as well as the structure and function of the VHL gene product, ultimately may provide clinicians with greater understanding of this malignancy as well as with methods for earlier diagnosis. The role of other tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, is incompletely understood. It is hoped that the techniques that have been applied to the study of RCC also will result in advances in our knowledge of other urologic malignancies. [References: 49]

N2  - Mutations in the VHL gene are associated with highly vascular tumors of kidney, brain, retina, and adrenal gland. The inability of the mutant VHL protein to destabilize HIF-1 plays a crucial role in malignant angiogenesis. VHL is also associated with ECM assembly but the molecular mechanisms of this activity remain unclear. We used expression arrays and cell lines with different VHL status to identify ECM-associated genes controlled by VHL. One of them, adhesion-associated TGFBI, was repressed by VHL and overexpressed in renal, gastrointestinal, brain, and other tumors. Analyzing the mechanism of TGFBI up-regulation in clear cell carcinoma, we identified a novel VHL target, a Kruppel-like transcriptional factor 10 (KLF10). The TGFBI promoter, which we isolated and studied in Luc-reporter assay, was induced by KLF10 but not hypoxia. These data provide the molecular basis for the observed VHL effect on TGFBI and stimulate further research into the KLF10 and TGFBI roles in cancer.

N1  - Veronica: no phenotype-genotype data
N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common form of kidney cancer, accounts for 3% of all adult malignancies and its incidence has significantly increased over the last 20 years. RCC claims 13,000 lives annually in the USA and more than 100,000 worldwide. A better understanding of the molecular basis of RCC has facilitated the development of novel and more selective therapeutic approaches. An important role in RCC oncogenesis is played by the receptor for HGF, Met, which has attracted considerable attention, more recently as a molecular target for cancer therapy, and several drugs selectively targeting this pathway are now in clinical trials. This review will focus on efforts to understand the role of the Met signaling pathway in renal cancer and how this has contributed to the development of potent and selective drug candidates. © 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.

N2  - In the past few years, therapies targeted at the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways, such as sunitinib and sorafenib, have been developed to treat clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the majority of patients will eventually show resistance to antiangiogenesis therapies. The purpose of our study was to identify novel pathways that could be potentially used as targets for new therapies. Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted on eight matched tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples. A novel RUNX1-RUNX1T1 pathway was identified which was upregulated in ccRCC through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We also confirmed the findings based on previously published gene expression microarray data. Our data shows that upregulated of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 gene set maybe an important factor contributing to the etiology of ccRCC.

N1  - Singh, Arun DAhmad, Nina NShields, Carol LShields, Jerry A Veronica: not enough patient data
N2  - PURPOSE: To report the results of genetic testing for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease in patients presenting with solitary retinal capillary hemangioma (RCH). METHODS: Ten patients with solitary RCH, who were excluded clinically as having VHL disease, underwent genetic testing using a combination of Southern blot, conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis, and direct sequence analysis. The results of the genetic tests were used to refine the empiric risk for VHL disease using principles of probability. RESULTS: Genetic testing for VHL disease was negative for mutation in all patients. The negative results of the genetic tests diminished the empiric risk for VHL disease by 100-fold. CONCLUSIONS: Solitary RCH can occur sporadically or be associated with VHL disease. In addition to clinical evaluation, genetic testing should be considered to exclude VHL disease with a high level of certainty.

N1  - Patient data was retrieved from another paper that has already been published to CIViC.
N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome, associated with the development of tumors and cysts in multiple organ systems, whose expression and age of onset are highly variable. The VHL disease tumor suppressor gene (VHL) maps to 3p25-p26 and mutations ranging from a single base change to large deletions have been detected in patients with VHL disease. We developed a single cell PCR protocol for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of VHL disease to select unaffected embryos on the basis of the detection of the specific mutation and segregation analysis of polymorphic linked markers. Multiplex-nested PCR using single buccal cells of an affected individual were performed in order to test the accuracy and reliability of this single-cell protocol. For each locus tested, amplification efficiency was 83% to 87% and allelic drop-out rates ranged from 12% to 8%. Three VHL disease PGD cycles were performed on cells from a couple with paternal transmission of a 436delC mutation in exon 2 of the VHL gene, leading to the identification of three unaffected embryos. Independent of the mutation present, this general PGD protocol for the diagnosis of VHL disease can be used in families informative for either the D3S1038 or D3S1317 microsatellite markers.

N1  - Veronica: no genotype-phenotype data
N2  - Loss of secreted phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R1) has recently been found to render human primary cells more resistant to senescence whereas increased PLA2R1 expression is able to induce cell cycle arrest, cancer cell death or blockage of cancer cell transformation in vitro, suggesting that PLA2R1 displays tumor suppressive activities. Here we report that PLA2R1 expression strongly decreases in samples of human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Knockdown of PLA2R1 increases renal cancer cell tumorigenicity supporting a role of PLA2R1 loss to promote in vivo RCC growth. Most RCC result from Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor loss-of-function and subsequent gain-of-function of the oncogenic HIF-2alpha/c-MYC pathway. Here, by genetically manipulating VHL, HIF-2alpha and c-MYC, we demonstrate that loss of VHL, stabilization of HIF-2alpha and subsequent increased c-MYC activity, binding and transcriptional repression, through induction of PLA2R1 DNA methylation closed to PLA2R1 transcriptional start site, results in decreased PLA2R1 transcription. Our results describe for the first time an oncogenic pathway leading to PLA2R1 transcriptional repression and the importance of this repression for tumor growth.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type (ccRCC) is associated with loss of functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein and high, homogeneous expression of the G250<sup>MN</sup> protein, an isoenzyme of the carbonic anhydrase family. High expression of G250<sup>MN</sup> is found in all ccRCCs, but not in most normal tissues, including normal human kidney. We specifically studied the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the CAIX<sup>G250</sup> gene in RCC. Previous studies identified Sp1 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) as main regulatory transcription factors of G250<sup>MN</sup> in various non-RCC backgrounds. However, G250<sup>MN</sup> regulation in RCC has not been studied and may be differently regulated in view of the HIF accumulation under normoxic conditions due to VHL mutations. Transient transfection of different G250 <sup>MN</sup> promoter constructs revealed strong promoter activity in G250 <sup>MN</sup> -positive RCC cell lines, but no activity in G250<sup>MN</sup> -negative cell lines. DNase-I footprint and band-shift analysis demonstrated that Sp1 and HIF-1alpha proteins in nuclear extracts of RCC cells bind to the CAIX promoter and mutations in the most proximal Sp1 binding element or HIF binding element completely abolished CAIX promoter activity, indicating their critical importance for the activation of G250 expression in RCC. A close correlation between HIF-1alpha expression and G250<sup>MN</sup> expression was observed. In contrast, no relationship between HIF-2alpha expression and G250<sup>MN</sup> was seen. The participation of cofactor CBP/p300 in the regulation of G250 transcription was shown. In conclusion, HIF-1alpha and Sp1, in combination with CBP/p300, are crucial elements for G250<sup>MN</sup> expression in ccRCC, and CAIX<sup>G250</sup> can be regarded as a unique HIF-1alpha target gene in ccRCC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of hereditary pheochromocytoma remains controversial because of the need for lifelong corticosteroid therapy and the risk of Addisonian crisis associated with bilateral total adrenalectomy. We examined our large series of patients with hereditary pheochromocytoma to evaluate postsurgical outcomes, particularly in those who underwent cortical-sparing adrenalectomy. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of all patients with histopathologic diagnoses of hereditary pheochromocytoma treated at our institution from 1962 to 2003. Familial disease was initially determined by pedigree analysis, genetic testing, or both for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 1, 2A, or 2B; von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL); neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1); or familial paraganglioma syndrome (FP). RESULTS: Adrenal pheochromocytomas were present in 56 of 59 patients (95%): MEN2A (39), MEN2B (7), VHL (6), MEN1 (2), NF-1 (2). Paragangliomas (extraadrenal pheochromocytomas) were present in the remaining 3 of 59 patients (5%): FP (2) and NF-1 (1). Thirty-eight of 56 patients with pheochromocytomas had cumulative operations resulting in total or subtotal bilateral adrenalectomy. Acute adrenal insufficiency (Addisonian crisis) occurred in 4 of these 38 patients (11%). Cortical-sparing adrenalectomy was performed in 26 patients who underwent bilateral adrenal resection; 17 (65%) were corticosteroid independent at a median followup of 71 months. Recurrent pheochromocytoma developed in an adrenal remnant in 3 of 30 patients (10%) who underwent unilateral or bilateral cortical-sparing procedures. Metastatic disease did not develop in any patient with pheochromocytoma, but has occurred in two of three patients with paragangliomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy can successfully avoid the need for corticosteroid replacement in the majority of patients who undergo a bilateral adrenalectomy. Long-term followup should include monitoring of the remnant gland for recurrent pheochromocytoma with yearly biochemical screening studies.

N2  - Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-1alpha/beta heterodimer is a master transcription factor for several genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, pH balance and metastasis. These HIF-1 target genes help tumors to overcome forthcoming metabolic obstacles as they grow. Under normoxic condition, the HIF-1alpha subunit is hydroxylated by its specific prolyl-4 hydroxylase 2, given the acronym PHD2. Hydroxylated HIF-1alpha becomes a target for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Src prevents hydroxylation-dependent ubiquitinylation of HIF-1alpha, thus stabilizing it under normoxic conditions. We found that active Src does not directly phosphorylate any tyrosine residue of PHD2. In vitro hydroxylation reaction showed that the presence of the purified active Src protein does not inhibit the hydroxylation activity of the purified PHD2 enzymes. Instead of directly inhibiting PHD2, Src recruits several downstream-signaling pathways to intercept hydroxylation-dependent ubiquitinylation of HIF-1alpha. Using biochemical and genetic inhibition, we demonstrated that Src requires reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase/Rac complex for stabilization of HIF-1alpha. We found that excess vitamin C treatment attenuates Src-induced HIF-1alpha activation. HIF-1alpha-hydroxylation-dependent VHL pull-down assay showed that Src inhibits cellular PHD2 activity by inducing ROS production in a mechanism involving Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase. Src-induced ROS reduces cellular vitamin C, which is required for the activity of PHD2, thus Src can block VHL recruitment of HIF-1alpha, leading to stabilization of HIF-1alpha.

N2  - There are three prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1, 2 and 3) that regulate the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the master transcriptional regulators that respond to changes in intracellular O(2) tension. In high O(2) tension (normoxia) the PHDs hydroxylate two conserved proline residues on HIF-1alpha, which leads to binding of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor, the recognition component of a ubiquitin-ligase complex, initiating HIF-1alpha ubiquitylation and degradation. However, it is not known whether PHDs and VHL act separately to exert their enzymatic activities on HIF-1alpha or as a multiprotein complex. Here we show that the tumour suppressor protein LIMD1 (LIM domain-containing protein) acts as a molecular scaffold, simultaneously binding the PHDs and VHL, thereby assembling a PHD-LIMD1-VHL protein complex and creating an enzymatic niche that enables efficient degradation of HIF-1alpha. Depletion of endogenous LIMD1 increases HIF-1alpha levels and transcriptional activity in both normoxia and hypoxia. Conversely, LIMD1 expression downregulates HIF-1 transcriptional activity in a manner depending on PHD and 26S proteasome activities. LIMD1 family member proteins Ajuba and WTIP also bind to VHL and PHDs 1 and 3, indicating that these LIM domain-containing proteins represent a previously unrecognized group of hypoxic regulators.

N2  - Much progress has recently been obtained in the classification and characterization of RCC by using cytogenetic, gene microarray and proteomic techniques. Pivotal for the understanding of the progression of malignancy of clear cell renal cell carcinomas are findings connecting its biology to inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene product (VHLp), found in most CC-RCCs. Disruption of VHLp function appears to be involved in altered cell cycle control, resistance to hypoxia, hyperangiogenesis and changes in the organization of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins in RCC. These changes are reflected in the overexpression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and other angiogenetic and metastasis-promoting factors. Other changes related to progression of malignancy in RCC are the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and changes in cell adhesion proteins. [References: 49]

N1  - Veronica: review
N2  - Therapeutic targeting of integral biological pathways, including those involving vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), has produced robust clinical effects and revolutionised the treatment of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (RCC). However, some patients are inherently resistant to these approaches and most, if not all, patients acquire resistance over time. As such, the biological basis for resistance to these targeted therapies and the clinical approach in this setting is of heightened interest. Emerging preclinical evidence suggests resistance is mediated via tumour and environmental changes, which allow for continued perfusion and tumour growth that is less reliant on VEGF. Furthermore, elements upstream of receptor blockade, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and protein kinase B (AKT), in addition to pathways independent of VEGF or mTOR, could drive tumour growth despite adequate target blockade. These considerations provide a rational basis for combination or sequential therapy targeting these elements. Clinical data support activity of several agents in resistant patient populations, with large-scale clinical trials ongoing to more thoroughly test several postulations regarding the optimum clinical approach. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Veronica: no novel patient study
N2  - Previous research has revealed that the von-Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) may downregulate never-in-mitosis A-related kinase 8 (NEK8) via hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha). The HIF-independent functions of pVHL also serve an important role in its tumor-suppressor action. In the present study, the association between pVHL and NEK8 was demonstrated in the human gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901, indicating a direct interaction of pVHL with NEK8. Subsequently, it was reported that MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, may attenuate pVHL overexpression-induced reductions in NEK8 protein expression levels. In addition, the present study revealed that pVHL may stimulate the rapid degradation of NEK8 protein and promote its ubiquitination. The association between the expression profile of NEK8 and the survival status of patients with gastric cancer was analyzed from an online database. Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicated that higher expression levels of NEK8 may lead to poor survival, as suggested by the transcriptomic data of 1,065 patients with gastric cancer. It was found that NEK8-knockdown mediated by RNA interference inhibited SGC-7901 and SNU-1 proliferation, colony formation and migration in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, the present study proposed that NEK8 may be a novel target of pVHL as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and may serve a role as a potential oncoprotein in human gastric cancer.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene has been shown to be mutated frequently not only in neoplasms from von Hippel-Lindau disease, but also in sporadic clear cell renal carcinoma. In order to reveal the possible role of the VHL tumor suppressor gene in the development of ovarian carcinoma, a total of 71 primary sporadic ovarian carcinomas were analyzed for the presence of mutations in the exon 2 and 3 of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, using the polymerase chain reaction with single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. No mutations in the VHL gene were found in any of the tumors analyzed. This result shows that the VHL tumor suppressor gene does not play a major role in the tumorigenesis of sporadic ovarian carcinoma.

N2  - We performed a comparative study of catecholamine content, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity, and TH mRNA levels in normal human adrenals and various clinical forms of human pheochromocytoma. We studied sporadic, benign intra-adrenal chromaffin tumors and other non-malignant intra-adrenal tumors associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B) and von Hippel-Lindau disease along with one extra-adrenal malignant pheochromocytoma. Our findings suggest substantial differences in TH transcriptional rates or the stability of TH mRNA or both may contribute to altered TH expression in human chromaffin cells associated with "normal" adrenal tissues and various forms of pheochromocytoma and distinctive patterns of expression in the different settings in which these tumors arise.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) regulate hundreds of genes involved in cellular adaptation to reduced oxygen availability. HIFs consist of an O2-labile alpha-subunit (primarily HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha) and a constitutive HIF-1beta subunit. In normoxia the HIF-alpha subunit is hydroxylated by members of a family of prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins, PHD1-3, resulting in recognition by von Hippel-Lindau protein, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In contrast, reduced oxygen availability inhibits PHD activity resulting in HIF-1alpha stabilisation and nuclear accumulation. Nuclear import of HIF-1alpha mainly depends on classical nuclear localisation signals (NLS) and involves importin alpha/beta heterodimers. Recently, a specific inhibitor of nuclear import has been identified that inhibits importin alpha/beta-dependent import with no effects on a range of other nuclear transport pathways involving members of the importin protein family. In this study we evaluated the physiological activity of this importin alpha/beta-inhibitor (Ivermectin) in the hypoxia response pathway. Treatment with Ivermectin decreases binding activity of HIF-1alpha to the importin alpha/beta-heterodimer. Moreover, HIF-1alpha nuclear localisation, nuclear HIF-1alpha protein levels, HIF-target gene expression, as well as HIF-transcriptional activity are reduced upon Ivermectin treatment. For the first time, we demonstrate the effect of specific importin alpha/beta-inhibition on the hypoxic response on the molecular level.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are chromaffin-cell tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal paraganglia, respectively. The dysfunction of genes involved in the cellular response to hypoxia, such as VHL, EGL nine homolog 1, and the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes, leads to a direct abrogation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) degradation, resulting in a pseudo-hypoxic state implicated in PCC/PGL development. Recently, somatic post-zygotic mutations in EPAS1 (HIF2A) have been found in patients with multiple PGLs and congenital erythrocytosis. We assessed 41 PCCs/ PGLs for mutations in EPAS1 and herein describe the clinical, molecular and genetic characteristics of the 7 patients found to carry somatic EPAS1 mutations; 4 presented with multiple PGLs (3 of them also had congenital erythrocytosis), whereas 3 were single sporadic PCC/PGL cases. Gene expression analysis of EPAS1-mutated tumors revealed similar mRNA EPAS1 levels to those found in SDH-gene- and VHL-mutated cases and a significant up-regulation of two hypoxia-induced genes (PCSK6 and GNA14). Interestingly, single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis revealed an exclusive gain of chromosome 2p in three EPAS1-mutated tumors. Furthermore, multiplex-PCR screening for small rearrangements detected a specific EPAS1 gain in another EPAS1-mutated tumor and in three non-EPAS1-mutated cases. The finding that EPAS1 is involved in the sporadic presentation of the disease not only increases the percentage of PCCs/PGLs with known driver mutations, but also highlights the relevance of studying other hypoxia-related genes in apparently sporadic tumors. Finally, the detection of a specific copy number alteration affecting chromosome 2p in EPAS1-mutated tumors may guide the genetic diagnosis of patients with this disease. © The Author 2013.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) binds to elongins B and C and posttranscriptionally regulates the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs under normoxic (21% O2) conditions. Here we report that pVHL binds, via elongin C, to the human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans Cul2 protein. Coimmunoprecipitation and chromatographic copurification data suggest that pVHL-Cul2 complexes exist in native cells. pVHL mutants that were unable to bind to complexes containing elongin C and Cul2 were likewise unable to inhibit the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs. A model for the regulation of hypoxia-inducible mRNAs by pVHL is presented based on the apparent similarity of elongin C and Cul2 to Skp1 and Cdc53, respectively. These latter proteins form complexes that target specific proteins for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein is the substrate binding subunit of the CBC(VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Mutations in the VHL gene cause a variety of tumors with complex genotype/phenotype correlations. Type 2A and type 2B VHL disease are characterized by a low or high risk of renal cell carcinoma, respectively. To investigate the molecular basis underlying the difference between disease types 2A and 2B, we performed a detailed biochemical analysis of the two most frequent type 2A mutations, Y98 H and Y112 H, in comparison to type 2B mutations in the same residues, Y98N and Y112N. While none of these mutations affected the assembly of CBC(VHL) complexes, the type 2A mutant proteins exhibited higher stabilities at physiological temperature. Moreover, the type 2A mutant proteins possessed higher binding affinities for the key cellular substrate, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF-1alpha). Consistent with these results, type 2A but not type 2B mutant VHL proteins retained significant ubiquitin ligase activity towards HIF-1alpha in vitro. We propose that this residual ubiquitin ligase activity is sufficient to suppress renal cell carcinogenesis in vivo.

N2  - Recent human studies found that the mRNA expression level of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) was positively associated with the prognosis of breast cancer. In this study, we used small interfering RNA techniques to knockdown ARNT2 expression in MCF7 human breast cancer cells, and found that an almost 40% downregulation of ARNT2 mRNA expression increased the expression of sensitive to apoptosis gene (3.36-fold), and decreased the expression of von Hippel-Lindau (0.27-fold) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (0.35-fold). The metabolite analysis revealed the contents of glucose, glycine, betaine, phosphocholine, pyruvate and lactate involved in the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-dependent glycolytic pathway were significantly lower in cells treated with siARNT2. Our results suggested that ARNT2 might play an important role in the modulation of HIF-1-regulated signaling and metabolism.

N2  - With the recent emergence of novel technologies, the field of biomarker discovery has been the subject of intense research and activity. Major advances in cancer control will be greatly aided by early detection for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in its pre-invasive state. Cancer being a diverse disease involves alterations in three classes of genes viz. (proto) oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and DNA repair genes offering a wide variety of opportunities for the development of biomarkers. The emergence of innovative technologies in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and imaging allows researchers to facilitate inclusive analysis of cancer cells. These approaches have already demonstrated its power to discriminate cancer cells from normal cells and to identify specific genetic elements involved in cancer progression. Cancer evolves via manifold pathways and is a culmination of a variety of genetic, molecular and clinical events. In the past few years, several reports have led to identification of novel cancer signatures via high throughput biology. Current review gives an overview of the bioinformatics tools, cancer database and available software package tools and further summarizes about different strategies involved in Omics research (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) for the development of cancer biomarkers. We also discuss about the current and emerging biomarkers in breast cancer with fundamental insight into different markers used in breast cancer detection. In addition, we focus upon the systematic integration of various omic data for accelerating cancer biomarker discovery with evidence based cancer management. The above strategies may lead to significant improvement in cancer screening, prognosis and management of therapeutic response in cancer patients. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

Veronica: both somatic and germline mutations are examined
N2  - BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma, a common malignant tumor arising from the kidney, occurs in 3.62 and 1.95 cases per one hundred thousand people among men and women, respectively, in Taiwan each year. Approximately 80% of cases are classified as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene has been implicated in the tumorigenic pathway of renal cell carcinoma. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs779805 and rs1642742, located in the promoter and 3' untranslated regions of the von Hippel-Lindau gene are informative and implicated in the occurrence of renal cell carcinoma worldwide. The aim of this study is to clarify whether these polymorphisms are associated with renal cell carcinoma in Taiwanese. Genomic DNA was isolated from normal and tumor tissues of 19 renal cell carcinoma patients. The samples were screened for allelic polymorphisms by restriction fragment length polymorphism with BsaJ I and Acc I digestion. Reconfirmation was carried out by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Consistent with Knudson's two-hit theory, AA to AG somatic mutations were observed in rs779805. In addition, loss of heterozygosity in both rs779805 and rs1642742 was demonstrated in 10 out of 15 RCC patients aged 50 or over. The G allele or AG heterozygote frequencies at these two loci were much higher in patient germline DNA when compared with the control group. After adjusting for age, the frequency of the G allele in both loci was much higher for late onset renal cell carcinoma in the Taiwanese population. CONCLUSIONS: Our current results confirmed that the existence of G allele in both rs779805 and rs1642742 in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene is of importance in renal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis. However, more comprehensive and detailed research is needed to address the clinical relevance. Larger sample size is required to determine the exact power of correlation between these two genetic polymorphisms and renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - Sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas frequently harbor inactivating mutations in exon 2 of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Here, we examine the effect of the loss of exon 2-encoded beta-domain function on VHL biochemical properties. Exon 2-encoded residues are required for VHL-mediated NEDD8 conjugation on cullin-2 and assembly with hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha) and fibronectin. These residues are not essential for VHL ability to assemble with elongin BC/cullin-2, to display E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and to confer energy-dependent nuclear import properties to a reporter protein. Localization studies in HIF-1alpha-null embryonic cells suggest that exon 2-encoded beta-domain mediates transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of VHL independently of assembly with HIF-1alpha and oxygen concentration. Exon 3-encoded alpha-helical domain is required for VHL complex formation with BC/cullin-2 and E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, for binding to HIFalpha/fibronectin, but this domain is not essential for transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking. VHL(-/-) renal carcinoma cells expressing beta-domain mutants failed to produce an extracellular fibronectin matrix and to degrade HIFalpha, which accumulated exclusively in the nucleus of normoxic cells. These results demonstrate that exon 2-encoded residues are involved in two independent functions: substrate protein recognition and transcription-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking. They also suggest that beta-domain mutations inactivate VHL function differently than alpha-domain mutations, potentially providing an explanation for the relationship between different mutations of the VHL gene and clinical outcome.

Veronica: describes a frameshift in exon 1 AND phenotype data but NO specific location of frameshift
N2  - INTRODUCTION: Myotonic dystrophy of Steinert, DM1, is the most common adult muscular dystrophy and generally is not associated to development on multiple site neoplasm. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome that is associated to tumors such as hemangioblastoma of the retina or central nervous system, clear-cell renal carcinoma (RCC) and endocrine tumors, most commonly pheochromocytoma and non-secretory pancreatic islet cell cancers. No data exist in literature describing the coexistence of both DM1 and VHL. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Herein we report a case of renal and pancreatic neoplasm in a young adult female affected by DM1 and VHL simultaneously. DISCUSSION: DM1 is due to an unstable trinucleotide (CTG) expansion in the 30 antranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene, located on chromosome 19q13.3. Several molecular mechanisms thought to be determining the classical DM phenotype have been shown. VHL disease is characterized by marked phenotypic variability and the most common tumors are hemangioblastomas of the retina or central nervous system, clear-cell renal carcinoma (RCC) and endocrine tumors, most commonly pheochromocytoma and non-secretory pancreatic islet cell cancers. The pancreatic manifestations seen in patients with VHL disease are divided into 2 categories: pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) as solid tumors, and cystic lesions, including a simple cyst and serous cystadenoma. The surgical approach for these cistic lesions is to consider as golden standard. Blansfield has proposed 3 criteria to predict metastatic disease of PNET in patients with VHL disease: (1) tumor size greater than or equal to 3cm; (2) presence of a mutation in exon 3; and (3) tumor doubling time less than 500d. If the patient has none of these criteria the patient could be followed with physical examination and radiological surveillance on a 2/3 years base.(4) If the patient has 1 criterion, the patient should be followed more closely every 6 months to 1 year. If the patient has 2 or 3 criteria, the patient should be considered for surgery given the high risk of future malignancy. Our patient owned only one criterion but in presence of a second malignant tumor. Our hypothesis for this rare findings is that both DM and VHL might be derived from genetic aberration and these might be linked to a major cancer susceptibility. As far as we know this is the first confirmed case of RCC and neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer occurring concurrently with VHL and, at the same time, DM1. According to this case report and the literature data a VHL should be ruled out in the presence of RCC presenting along with pancreatic cysts/tumor. CONCLUSION: As far as we know this is the first confirmed case of RCC and neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer occurring concurrently with VHL and, at the same time, DM1. Our hypothesis for the unusual findings is that both DM and VHL derived from genetic aberration and these are linked to a major cancer susceptibility.

N2  - Mitochondria play essential roles in cellular metabolism, redox homeostasis, and regulation of cell death. Emerging evidences suggest that cancer cells exhibit various degrees of mitochondrial dysfunctions and metabolic alterations, which may serve as a basis to develop therapeutic strategies to preferentially kill the malignant cells. Mitochondria as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment is gaining much attention in the recent years, and agents that impact mitochondria with anticancer activity have been identified and tested in vitro and in vivo using various experimental systems. Anticancer agents that directly target mitochondria or indirectly affect mitochondrial functions are collectively classified as mitocans. This review article focuses on several natural compounds that preferentially kill cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction, and discusses the possible underlying mechanisms and their therapeutic implications in cancer treatment. Mitocans that have been comprehensively reviewed recently are not included in this article. Important issues such as therapeutic selectivity and the relevant biochemical basis are discussed in the context of future perspectives. © 2010.

N2  - The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) regulate the stability of HIF protein by post-translational hydroxylation of two conserved prolyl residues in its alpha subunit in an oxygen-dependent manner. Trans-4-prolyl hydroxylation of HIFalpha under normal oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) availability enables its association with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor pVHL E3 ligase complex, leading to the degradation of HIFalpha via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Due to the obligatory requirement of molecular O<sub>2</sub> as a co-substrate, the activity of PHDs is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, resulting in stabilized HIFalpha, which dimerizes with HIFbeta and, together with transcriptional co-activators CBP/p300, activates the transcription of its target genes. As a key molecular regulator of adaptive response to hypoxia, HIF plays important roles in multiple cellular processes and its overexpression has been detected in various cancers. The HIF1alpha isoform in particular has a strong impact on cellular metabolism, most notably by promoting anaerobic, whilst inhibiting O<sub>2</sub>-dependent, metabolism of glucose. The PHD enzymes also seem to have HIF-independent functions and are subject to regulation by factors other than O<sub>2</sub>, such as by metabolic status, oxidative stress, and abnormal levels of endogenous metabolites (oncometabolites) that have been observed in some types of cancers. In this review, we aim to summarize current understandings of the function and regulation of PHDs in cancer with an emphasis on their roles in metabolism.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs) originate in cells that share a common neuroectodermal origin. Like other neuroendocrine neoplasms, they are characterized by a propensity to secrete amines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and peptide hormones (calcitonin). Improved understanding of underlying molecular pathways, such as mutations of the RET (rearranged during transfection) proto-oncogene, has led to new rational targeted therapies. Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) originate in the steroid hormone-producing adrenal cortex. While tumors of the adrenal cortex are not, strictly speaking, part the "diffuse neuroendocrine system," they are often included in neuroendocrine tumor guidelines due to their orphan status. In this update on management of unusual neuroendocrine tumors, we review the biology and treatment of these rare neoplasms. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) interacts with and inhibits the cellular transcription factor elongin. However, the subcellular localization of pVHL has remained uncertain. Naturally occurring pVHL mutants which fail to interact with elongin have been described in patients with VHL disease or sporadic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, we have examined the cellular expression pattern of endogenous pVHL in different RCC cell lines by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Both anti-N-terminal and anti-C-terminal pVHL antibodies were able to recognize endogenous wild-type pVHL expressed by the RCC cells studied. A C-terminal truncated VHL mutant expressed by RCC cell line A498 was detected only by the N-terminal antibody but not by the C-terminal antibody as expected. The overall staining patterns of these cell lines are similar, with a predominant nuclear speckled pattern and a moderate cytoplasmic staining in subconfluent cell cultures. Interestingly, when cells reached confluency, more prominent nuclear staining with little or no cytoplasmic expression was observed. By using double labeling with anti-VHL and anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) antibodies and cell cycle analyses, we found that in the G1/G0-phase, pVHL was localized exclusively in the nucleus associated with distinctive large subnuclear structures, whereas the majority of the cells in S-phase of the cell cycle also showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Our results indicate that subcellular localization of pVHL is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

N2  - In the context of multiple neuroendocrine tumor syndromes, reproductive abnormalities may occur via a number of different mechanisms, such as hyperprolactinemia, increased GH/IGF-1 levels, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypercortisolism, hyperandrogenism, hyperthyroidism, gonadotropin hypersecretion, as well as, tumorigenesis or functional disturbances in gonads or other reproductive organs. Precocious puberty and/or male feminization is a feature of McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Carney complex (CNC), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), while sperm maturation and ovulation defects have been described in MAS and CNC. Although tumorigenesis of reproductive organs due to a multiple neuroendocrine tumor syndrome is very rare, certain lesions are characteristic and very unusual in the general population. Awareness leading to their recognition is important especially when other endocrine abnormalities coexist, as occasionally they may even be the first manifestation of a syndrome. Lesions such as certain types of ovarian cysts (MAS, CNC), pseudogynecomastia due to neurofibromas of the nipple-areola area (NF1), breast disease (CNC and Cowden disease (CD)), cysts and 'hypernephroid' tumors of the epididymis or bilateral papillary cystadenomas (mesosalpinx cysts) and endometrioid cystadenomas of the broad ligament (von Hippel-Lindau disease), testicular Sertoli calcifying tumors (CNC, PJS) monolateral or bilateral macroochidism and microlithiasis (MAS) may offer diagnostic clues. In addition, multiple neuroendocrine tumor syndromes may be complicated by reproductive malignancies including ovarian cancer in CNC, breast and endometrial cancer in CD, breast malignancies in NF1, and malignant sex-cord stromal tumors in PJS. © 2009 Society for Endocrinology.

N2  - Background: Somatic alteration of the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene (VHL) is one of the most common genetic changes observed in the sporadic, clear-cell subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the prognostic utility of VHL mutations has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between VHL mutations and the risk of death from sporadic clear-cell RCC. Methods: A total of 187 Japanese patients with clear-cell RCC who underwent nephrectomy from October 1986 through December 1995 were examined for somatic VHL gene alteration. Clinicopathologic and survival data were also collected. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore associations. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: A VHL alteration (mutation or hypermethylation) was detected in 108 RCC tumor samples: intragenic mutations in 98 (52%) and hypermethylation in 10 (5.3%). VHL alterations were strongly associated with better cancer-free survival and cancer-specific survival for the 134 patients with stage I-III clear-cell RCC treated by radical nephrectomy (log-rank P = .024 and .023, respectively). These associations were more statistically significant among patients with relatively advanced disease (stage III [P = .014 and .010, respectively] or stage II + III [P = .002 and. 009]) or higher grade tumors (G3 or higher [P = .013 and .032] or G2 or higher [P = .013 and .018]) and among patients who presented with symptoms (r = .00.5 and .012). VHL alterations remained an independent prognostic factor for patients with stage I-III tumors after adjustment for sex, age, stage, grading, and symptomatic presentation. VHL alterations were not associated with cancer-specific survival for the 53 patients with stage IV tumors treated with palliative or adjunctive nephrectomy (log-rank P = .760). Conclusion: The VHL alteration status may provide useful prognostic information, as a biomolecular marker, for patients with stage I-III clear-cell RCC who have undergone nephrectomy.

N2  - Distinction between benign adrenal cortical proliferative lesions and adrenal cortical carcinoma has been approached by a combination of histological, immunohistochemical, and macroscopical parameters. Modern imaging studies allow detection of small adrenal cortical lesions that may be incorrectly diagnosed. Differentiation between benign and malignant tumors of the adrenal cortex was attempted by microdissection of nine cases of adrenal cortical hyperplasia, 10 cortical adenomas, and 18 adrenal cortical carcinomas with subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of five microsatellites of putative tumor suppressor gene loci: p53 gene (17p), the neuroblastoma candidate gene (1p), the p16 gene (9p), the von Hippel Lindau gene (3p), and the retinoblastoma gene (13q). None of the hyperplastic lesions or cortical adenomas showed LOH of any of the gene markers used. Conversely, genetic changes were observed in 61% (11 of 18) of the cases of carcinoma. Forty-four percent of the lesions showed LOH for p53 (7 of 16). LOH of 1p, 3p, and 9p were seen in 22%, 22%, and 26%, respectively. LOH of the retinoblastoma gene was seen in 80% or four of five of the informative cases studied. We conclude that LOH studies may be used to distinguish malignant from nonmalignant adrenal cortical proliferations. Relative infrequency of LOH in 3p may furthermore help to differentiate adrenal lesions from clear cell carcinomas of the kidney.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla originating in the chromaffin cells derived from the neural crest. Ten % of these tumors are associated with the familial cancer syndromes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), and rarely, neurofibromatosis type 1, in which germ-line mutations have been identified in RET, VHL, and NF1, respectively. In both the sporadic and familial form of pheochromocytoma, allelic loss at 1p, 3p, 17p, and 22q has been reported, yet the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors is largely unknown. Allelic loss at chromosome 1p has also been reported in other endocrine tumors, such as medullary thyroid cancer and tumors of the parathyroid gland, as well as in tumors of neural crest origin including neuroblastoma and malignant melanoma. In this study, we performed fine structure mapping of deletions at chromosome 1p in familial and sporadic pheochromocytomas to identify discrete regions likely housing tumor suppressor genes involved in the development of these tumors. Ten microsatellite markers spanning a region of approximately 70 cM (1pter to 1p34.3) were used to screen 20 pheochromocytomas from 19 unrelated patients for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). LOH was detected at five or more loci in 8 of 13 (61%) sporadic samples and at five or more loci in four of five (80%) tumor samples from patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. No LOH at 1p was detected in pheochromocytomas from two VHL patients. Analysis of the combined sporadic and familial tumor data suggested three possible regions of common somatic loss, designated as PC1 (D1S243 to D1S244), PC2 (D1S228 to D1S507), and PC3 (D1S507 toward the centromere). We propose that chromosome 1p may be the site of at least three putative tumor suppressor loci involved in the tumorigenesis of pheochromocytomas. At least one of these loci, PC2 spanning an interval of <3.8 cM, is likely to have a broader role in the development of endocrine malignancies.

N2  - pVHL, product of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, functions as the substrate recognition component of an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha) is the well-known substrate of pVHL. Besides HIFalpha, pVHL also binds to many other proteins and has multiple functions. In this manuscript, we report that the nuclear clusterin (nCLU) is a target of pVHL. We found that pVHL had a direct interaction with nCLU. nCLU bound to pVHL at pVHL's beta domain, the site for recognition of substrate, indicating that nCLU might be a substrate of pVHL. Interestingly, pVHL bound to nCLU but did not lead to nCLU destruction. Further studies indicated that pVHL mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of nCLU and promoted nCLU nuclear translocation. In summary, our results disclose a novel function of pVHL that mediates K63-linked ubiquitination and identify nCLU as a new target of pVHL.

N2  - The VHL tumour-suppressor gene (TSG) has a critical 'gatekeeper' role in regulating growth and differentiation of human kidney cells, and inactivation of the VHL gene is the most frequent genetic event in human kidney cancer. There are many similarities between the genetics of the VHL and retinoblastoma TSGs, but the VHL tumourigenesis model is more complex. Here, we examine the current knowledge of the genetics and functional aspects of the VHL TSG, and emphasize how the VHL gene provides a paradigm that illustrates many aspects of TSG biology.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2) express phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine, whereas those in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome do not. Consequently, pheochromocytomas in MEN-2 produce epinephrine, whereas those in VHL syndrome produce mainly norepinephrine. This study examined whether transcription factors known to regulate expression of PNMT explain the different tumor phenotypes in these syndromes. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting were used to assess levels of mRNA and protein for the glucocorticoid receptor, early growth response 1 (Egr-1), the Sp1 transcription factor (Sp1), and MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) in 6 MEN-2 and 13 VHL tumors. Results were cross-checked with data obtained using microarray gene expression profiling in a further set of 10 MEN-2 and 12 VHL tumors. Pheochromocytomas in MEN-2 and VHL syndrome did not differ in expression of the glucocorticoid receptor, Egr-1, Sp1, or MAZ as assessed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting. Microarray data also indicated no relevant differences in expression of the glucocorticoid receptor, Egr-1, MAZ, and the AP2 transcription factor. Thus, our results do not support a role for the above transcription factors in determining differences in expression of PNMT in pheochromocytomas from patients with VHL syndrome and MEN-2. Microarray analysis, however, did indicate differences in expression of genes involved in neural crest cell lineage and chromaffin cell development, consistent with differential survival of PNMT-expressing cells in the two syndromes.

N2  - The degree of cooperation and redundancy between different chaperones is an important problem in understanding how proteins fold in the cell. Here we use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to examine in vivo the chaperone requirements for assembly of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL)-elongin BC (VBC) tumor suppressor complex. VHL and elongin BC expressed in yeast assembled into a correctly folded VBC complex that resembles the complex from mammalian cells. Unassembled VHL did not fold and remained associated with the cytosolic chaperones Hsp70 and TRiC/CCT, in agreement with results from mammalian cells. Analysis of the folding reaction in yeast strains carrying conditional chaperone mutants indicates that incorporation of VHL into VBC requires both functional TRiC and Hsp70. VBC assembly was defective in cells carrying either a temperature-sensitive ssa1 gene as their sole source of cytosolic Hsp70/SSA function or a temperature-sensitive mutation in CCT4, a subunit of the TRiC/CCT complex. Analysis of the VHL-chaperone interactions in these strains revealed that the cct4ts mutation decreased binding to TRiC but did not affect the interaction with Hsp70. In contrast, loss of Hsp70 function disrupted the interaction of VHL with both Hsp70 and TRiC. We conclude that, in vivo, folding of some polypeptides requires the cooperation of Hsp70 and TRiC and that Hsp70 acts to promote substrate binding to TRiC.

N2  - The biological functions of Myc are to regulate cell growth,apoptosis, cell differentiation and stem-cell self-renewal. Abnormal accumulation of c-Myc is able to induce excessive proliferation of normal cells. von Hippel-Lindau protein(pVHL) is a key regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha(HIF1alpha), thus accumulation and hyperactivation of HIF1alpha is the most prominent feature of VHL-mutated renal cell carcinoma. Interestingly, the Myc pathway is reported to be activated in renal cell carcinoma even though the precise molecular mechanism still remains to be established. Here, we demonstrated that pVHL locates at the c-Myc promoter region through physical interaction with Myc. Furthermore, pVHL reinforces HDAC1/2 recruitment to the Myc promoter, which leads to the auto-suppression of Myc. Therefore, one possible mechanism of Myc auto-suppression by pVHL entails removing histone acetylation. Our study identifies a novel mechanism for pVHL-mediated negative regulation of c-Myc transcription.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma (PHEO), a rare catecholamine producing tumor arising from the chromaffin cells, may occurs sporadically (76%-80%) or as part of inherited syndromes (20%-24%). Angiogenesis is a fundamental step in tumor proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) is the most well-characterized angiogenic factor. The role of angiogenic markers in PHEO is not fully understood; investigations were therefore made to evaluate the expression of VEGF-A and its receptors in PHEO and correlate to clinical parameters. Twenty-nine samples of PHEO were evaluated for VEGF-A, VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) VEGFR-2 expression and microvessel density (MVD) by immunohistochemistry. Clinical data were reviewed in medical records. The mean age of patients was 38 +/- 14 years, and 69% were woman. VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 staining were detected in nearly all PHEO samples. No significant correlation was observed between VEGF-A, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 expression or MVD and age at diagnosis, tumor size or sporadic and hereditary PHEO. However, the levels of expression of these molecules were significantly higher in malignant PHEO samples (p = 0.027, p = 0.003 and p = 0.026, respectively).VEGF-A and its receptors were shown to be up-regulated in malignant PHEO, suggesting that these molecules might be considered as therapeutic targets for unresectable or metastatic tumors. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a heritable syndrome that confers an increased risk of developing various benign and malignant tumors to those with a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene. We present a case of a male patient who initially presented at age 9 with headaches, fevers, and fatigue. He was found to have a left pheochromocytoma which was successfully managed with open total adrenalectomy. He presented again at age 18 with a second pheochromocytoma in the right adrenal gland. DNA analysis revealed a de novo Val84Leu mutation in the Von Hippel-Lindau gene, not seen in either parent. The challenge presented was that of balancing the obvious benefits of cortical-sparing adrenalectomy with the risk of tumor recurrence in spared tissue. Ultimately, management consisted of a robot-assisted laparoscopic partial right adrenalectomy with successful preservation of adrenocortical function. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Fluorescein angiography (FA) is used for the identification of retinal capillary hemangiomas in patients with von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL). We show that new retinal hemangiomas can also be identified using wide-field autofluorescence imaging, which may obviate the need for fluorescein administration in some cases. Methods: A consecutive, retrospective case series of patients with von Hippel Lindau disease that were seen between 2011 and 2013. Results: Thirty-one patients with previously identified mutations of the VHL gene were seen between 2011 and 2013. During this time period, they underwent 102 wide-field retinal imaging studies using the Optos system, which included autofluorescence as well as FA. Seventeen patients (55%, median age 34 years) were found to have retinal capillary hemangiomas, of whom 11 developed a total of 17 new hemangiomas during the study period. Fourteen patients (45%, median age 14.5 years) remained hemangioma- . Of the newly identified hemangiomas, 9 were located within the autofluorescence image field. Notably, all 9 of these lesions (100%) were detectable using autofluorescence. All new hemangiomas that were not visualized with autofluorescence were located outside of the autofluorescence image field. Hemangiomas that remained active despite treatment did not appear significantly different on autofluorescence from ones that had been treated successfully. Conclusions: Wide-field autofluorescence imaging is as effective as FA for detecting new retinal capillary hemangiomas associated with von Hippel Lindau disease. While FA is superior for surveillance of previously treated hemangiomas, obtaining autofluorescence images from retinal periphery may obviate the need for fluorescein administration in screening younger VHL patients for new hemangiomas.

N1  - Baldewijns, Marcella Mvan Vlodrop, Iris J HVermeulen, Peter BSoetekouw, Patricia M M Bvan Engeland, Manonde Bruine, Adriaan P Veronica: review
N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays an important role in renal tumourigenesis. In the majority of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most frequent and highly vascularized RCC subtype, HIF is constitutively activated by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene. Of the HIF subunits, HIF-2alpha appears to be more oncogenic than HIF-1alpha, in that HIF-2alpha activates pro-tumourigenic target genes. In addition, recent studies indicate that HIF-1alpha, more than HIF-2alpha, can undergo proteasomal degradation in VHL - /- RCC cells. A more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of hypoxia and angiogenesis in renal carcinogenesis has set the stage for the development of targeted therapies, inhibiting multiple HIF-related pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mTOR, RAS/RAF/MAP, and VEGF signalling routes. However, despite the positive results of these targeting agents in progression-free survival, clinical resistance remains an issue. Recent pre-clinical studies have suggested new targeting approaches such as inhibition of HIF-driven key metabolic enzymes and have introduced new HIF targeting agents, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, with successful anti-neoplastic effects. In this review, we discuss existing and novel findings about RCC carcinogenesis, with subsequent clinical implications. [References: 150]

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary tumor syndrome in which affected individuals may develop CNS and retinal hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas, renal cell carcinoma, and cysts of various organs. The VHL gene has been localized to chromosome 3p25-26 and >500 germline mutations have been identified. A rare variant of the VHL gene results in the substitution of lysine for proline at position 25 (P25L) in the larger of the two VHL proteins. This VHL variant has previously been described in a limited number of cases and has been strongly suggested to be non-pathogenic, but this has not been proven. METHODS: A family with a medical history suggestive of VHL disease was investigated using DNA sequence analysis to determine the presence of the P25L variant of the VHL protein. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified the VHL P25L variant in 7 of 14 family members, one of whom had a single retinal hemangioma, which is in itself insufficient to diagnose VHL disease. The variant was not identified in a family member with clear cell renal carcinoma, which is a hallmark feature of VHL disease. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these results, it is concluded that P25L is a benign variant of the VHL protein and individuals carrying this variant should not be required to undergo screening for VHL manifestations.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are heterodimeric oxygen-sensitive basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that play central roles in cellular adaptation to low oxygen environments. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) is the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and functions as a master regulator of HIF activity by targeting the hydroxylated HIF-alpha subunit for ubiquitylation and rapid proteasomal degradation under normoxic conditions. Mutations in pVHL can be found in familial and sporadic hemangioblastomas, clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, pheochromocytomas and inherited forms of erythrocytosis, illustrating the importance of disrupted molecular oxygen sensing in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Tissue-specific gene targeting of pVHL in mice has demonstrated that efficient execution of HIF proteolysis is critically important for normal tissue physiology, and has provided novel insights into the functional consequences of HIF activation on the cellular and tissue level. Here we focus on the contribution of individual HIF transcription factors to the development of VHL phenotypes and discuss how the pVHL/HIF axis could be exploited pharmacologically. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a central role in oxidative stress, which leads to the onset of diseases, such as cancer. Furthermore, ROS contributes to the delicate balance between tumor cell survival and death. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells decide to elicit survival or death signals during oxidative stress are not completely understood. We have previously reported that ROS enhanced tumorigenic functions in prostate cancer cells, such as transendothelial migration and invasion, which depended on CXCR4 and AKT signaling. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which ROS facilitated cell death through activation of AKT. We initially observed that ROS enhanced the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells. The tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of AKT signaling, was rendered catalytically inactive through oxidation by ROS, although the expression levels remained consistent. Despite these events, cells still underwent apoptosis. Further investigation into apoptosis revealed that expression of the tumor suppressor pVHL increased, and contains a target site for p-AKT phosphorylation. pVHL and p-AKT associated in vitro, and knockdown of pVHL rescued HIF1alpha expression and the cells from apoptosis. Collectively, our study suggests that in the context of oxidative stress, p-AKT facilitated apoptosis by inducing pVHL function.

N2  - Currently, the disease management and therapeutic strategies for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have arisen from cancer biology discoveries, but have evolved fairly independently of individual tumor biology. Thus, a gap has emerged in our understanding of the fundamental paradigms of what core molecular features are important for tissue-based biomarker research today. Although extensive effort has been placed on identifying molecular biomarkers for RCC, remarkably, there are few validated biomarkers with substantive impact on managing disease prognosis. The emergence of high-throughput molecular profiling technologies provides the opportunity to explore the underlying molecular features of RCC that will warrant the enhanced understanding of its biology and shed light on future therapeutic methods to treat the disease. In this review, we will discuss noteworthy prognostic biomarkers of RCC, with a focus on clear cell RCC, and their potential impact on the clinical arena.© 2013 Optimal Clinical.

N2  - Motivation: Cancer is an evolutionary process characterized by accumulating mutations. However, the precise timing and the order of genetic alterations that drive tumor progression remain enigmatic. Results: We present a specific probabilistic graphical model for the accumulation of mutations and their interdependencies. The Bayesian network models cancer progression by an explicit unobservable accumulation process in time that is separated from the observable but error-prone detection of mutations. Model parameters are estimated by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the underlying interaction graph is obtained by a simulated annealing procedure. Applying this method to cytogenetic data for different cancer types, we find multiple complex oncogenetic pathways deviating substantially from simplified models, such as linear pathways or trees. We further demonstrate how the inferred progression dynamics can be used to improve genetics-based survival predictions which could support diagnostics and prognosis. © The Author(s) 2009.

N2  - A case of proximal 3p deletion is reported in tumor cells from a patient with renal cell carcinoma and von Hippel-Lindau disease. This is the first report of this deletion with renal cell carcinoma. With the previously detected translocations at the same breakpoint, this report confirms the 3p14 breakpoint as critical in this neoplasm. This strongly suggests that renal cell carcinoma results from a change in the genetic material in the proximal short arm of chromosome #3.

N2  - One of the outstanding fundamental questions in cancer cell biology concerns how cells coordinate cellular growth (or macromolecular synthesis) with cell cycle progression and mitosis. Intuitively, rapidly dividing cells must have some control over these processes; otherwise cells would continue to shrink in volume with every passing cycle, similar to the cytoreductive divisions seen in the very early stages of embryogenesis. The problem is easily solved in unicellular organisms, such as yeast, as their growth rates are entirely dependent on nutrient availability. Multicellular organisms such as mammals, however, must have acquired additional levels of control, as nutrient availability is seldom an issue and the organism has a prodigious capacity to store necessary metabolites in the form of glycogen, lipids, and protein. Furthermore, the specific needs and specialized architecture of tissues must constrain growth for growth's sake; if not, the necessary function of the organ could be lost. While certainly a myriad of mechanisms for preventing this exist via initiating cell death (e.g. apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis), these all depend on some external cue, such as death signals, hypoxia, lack of nutrients or survival signals. However there must also be some cell autonomous method for surveying against inappropriate growth signals (such as oncogenic stress) that occur in a stochastic fashion, possibly as a result of random mutations. The ARF tumor suppressor seems to fulfill that role, as its expression is near undetectable in normal tissues, yet is potently induced by oncogenic stress (such as overexpression of oncogenic Ras or myc). As a result of induced expression of ARF, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is stabilized and promotes cell cycle arrest. Mutations or epigenetic alterations of the INK4a/Arf locus are second only to p53 mutations in cancer cells, and in some cancers, alterations in both Arf and p53 observed, suggesting that these two tumor suppressors act coordinately to prevent unwarranted cell growth and proliferation. The aim of this review is to characterize the current knowledge in the field about both p53-dependent and independent functions of ARF as well as to summarize the present models for how ARF might control rates of cell proliferation and/or macromolecular synthesis. We will discuss potential therapeutic targets in the ARF pathway, and some preliminary attempts at enhancing or restoring the activity of this important tumor suppressor. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N1  - Veronica: no phenotype data
N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations of the VHL gene. Recent studies suggest that VHL protein (pVHL) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, but the detailed biological function of pVHL remains to be determined. To further elucidate the biological functions of pVHL, we searched pVHL-interacting proteins using yeast two-hybrid screening. A novel protein named VHL-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1 (VDU1) was identified as being able to directly interact with pVHL in vitro and in vivo. We have determined the full-length cDNA of this enzyme, which includes two putative subtypes. Type I consists of 942 amino acids, and type II consists of 911 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 107 and 103 kDa, respectively. We have also cloned a mouse homologue of this enzyme. Sequence analysis reveals that this protein is conserved between human and mouse and contains the signature motifs of the ubiquitin-specific processing protease family. Enzymatic function studies demonstrate its deubiquitinating activity. We have determined that the VDU1-interacting region in pVHL is located in its beta-domain, and several naturally occurring mutations located in this domain disrupt the interaction between pVHL and VDU1 protein. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that VDU1 can be recruited into the pVHL-elongin C-elongin B complex. Finally, we demonstrate that VDU1 is able to be ubiquitinated via a pVHL-dependent pathway for proteasomal degradation, and VHL mutations that disrupt the interaction between VDU1 and pVHL abrogate the ubiquitination of VDU1. Our findings indicate that VDU1, a novel ubiquitin-specific processing protease, is a downstream target for ubiquitination and degradation by pVHL E3 ligase. Targeted degradation of VDU1 by pVHL could be crucial for regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway.

N2  - Molecular knowledge has deeply affected the treatment and outcome of kidney cancer in recent years, and several therapeutic options have become available. However, there are no validated biomarkers to select the best drug for each patient. Already published studies and ongoing investigations could change this scenario in the near future. Regarding antiangiogenic drugs, several works on single nucleotide polymorphisms have achieved promising results, with some SNPs predicting resistance to sunitinib and pazopanib being validated. If more evidence is gained, it could prompt prospective studies exploring a molecularly driven selection of treatment. Another relevant line of investigation for antiangiogenic drugs is the cytokines and antiangiogenic factors. Different studies have found that cytokines and antiangiogenic factors are able to predict the outcome of patients treated with sunitinib, pazopanib, or sorafenib. Issues regarding the thresholds of normality and the best time for assessment are pending, but the communicated results are encouraging. Less evidence is available for mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors but recent data support a key role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and points toward poor response to angiogenic drugs when the pathway is activated. Whether modern phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors could be the best option for these patients is a question that should be addressed. Additionally, a new class of immunomodulators, like anti-programmed death 1 drugs, has demonstrated to achieve long-lasting stabilizations even in some patients with no radiological response or early progression. This is a singular situation where the identification of reliable predictors of efficacy will be key in the development of these drugs in renal cell carcinoma. Finally, germline mutations of the c-Met gene have been proposed as the first predictor of response to targeted therapies in papillary renal cell carcinoma. As a conclusion, translational research will be a cornerstone to move a next step forward in kidney cancer. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - We describe a case of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) through three generations of the same family. First presentation was a young female with a 6-week history of headaches behind the eyes. On examination she was found to have bilateral retinal capillary haemangiomas (RCH). Preliminary diagnosis of VHL was suspected and further investigations confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient was found to have pancreatic and kidney lesions and her mother had a cerebellar haemangioblastoma. Following genetic testing, the VHL gene appeared in the 9-year-old boy. On recent presymptomatic ophthalmic screening, the child was found to have RCH. Both patient and child's RCHs were successfully managed with a variety of treatments.

    	Kaelin, William G Jr Veronica: no patient data
N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL), which resides on chromosome 3p25, is mutated or silenced in >50% of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas. Germ-line VHL mutations give rise to VHL disease, which is characterized by an increased risk of blood vessel tumors (hemangioblastomas) and renal cell carcinomas. In this setting, VHL inactivation gives rise to premalignant renal cysts. Additional genetic alterations are presumably required for conversion of these cysts to renal cell carcinomas. Restoration of VHL function in VHL-/- renal cell carcinomas is sufficient to inhibit tumorigenesis in vivo. On the basis of these and other data, VHL appears to be a critical gatekeeper with respect to the development of renal cell carcinoma. The VHL gene product, pVHL, is the substrate recognition module of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for destruction in the presence of oxygen. Hypoxic cells, or cells lacking pVHL, accumulate high levels of HIF, which activates the transcription of a variety of genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor B, and transforming growth factor alpha. We have demonstrated that inhibition of HIF is necessary and sufficient for tumor suppression by pVHL in renal cell carcinoma nude mouse xenograft assays. This provides a rationale for treating VHL-/- renal cell carcinoma with inhibitors of HIF or its downstream targets. Genotype-phenotype correlations in VHL disease suggest, however, that pVHL has targets in addition to HIF. Elucidating these targets should provide a more complete picture of how pVHL suppresses tumor growth. [References: 92]

N2  - The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has gradually increased, and approximately 40% of all patients diagnosed with this disease will die of it. With the increasing availability of ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scanning, incidental renal tumors are more frequently diagnosed. Overall, conflicting evidence still exists to support a trend towards early diagnosis and/or a change in the natural history of the disease. The localization of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene and other regions on chromosome 3p have contributed significantly to our understanding of the molecular genetics of both familial and sporadic RCC. Moreover, distinction between different cell types of RCC are being made at the molecular and genetic level. A relationship between environmental factors, such as cigarette smoking, and these genetic disturbances has yet to be determined. Although different determinants of nuclear grading are being proposed as prognostic factors, no convincing evidence has been identified to support the use of other molecular markers, such as the p53 tumor suppressor gene and epidermal growth factor. With regard to treatment, beyond the role of surgery in organ-confined RCC, other therapies for RCC are limited. Furthermore, immunotherapy has shown the best promise by providing durable responses in patients with advanced disease. [References: 64]

N2  - Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare haematopoietic malignancy characterized by dismal prognosis and overall poor therapeutic response. Since the biology of BPDCN is barely understood, our study aims to shed light on the genetic make-up of these highly malignant tumors. Using targeted high-coverage massive parallel sequencing, we investigated 50 common cancer genes in 33 BPDCN samples. We detected point mutations in NRAS (27.3% of cases), ATM (21.2%), MET, KRAS, IDH2, KIT (9.1% each), APC and RB1 (6.1% each), as well as in VHL, BRAF, MLH1, TP53 and RET (3% each). Moreover, NRAS, KRAS and ATM mutations were found to be mutually exclusive and we observed recurrent mutations in NRAS, IDH2, APC and ATM. CDKN2A deletions were detected in 27.3% of the cases followed by deletions of RB1 (9.1%), PTEN and TP53 (3% each). The mutual exclusive distribution of some mutations may point to different subgroups of BPDCN whose biological significance remains to be explored.

    	Rini, Brian I Veronica: review
N2  - PURPOSE: To review the biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the clinical results of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) blockade in metastatic RCC. METHODS: A review of relevant published literature regarding VEGF, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation, and VEGF overexpression in RCC was performed. Further, a review of the mechanism, toxicity, and clinical development of VEGF-targeted therapy in metastatic RCC was undertaken. RESULTS: VHL tumor suppressor gene inactivation is observed in the majority of clear cell RCC cases, leading to VEGF overexpression. Therapy with agents directed against the VEGF protein or the VEGF receptor have demonstrated initial clinical activity in metastatic RCC. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic targeting of VEGF in RCC has strong biologic rationale. Substantial clinical activity has been reported in initial clinical trials with VEGF-targeting agents. Further investigation is needed to optimally use these agents for maximal clinical benefit. [References: 55]

Veronica: somatic; no novel patient study
N2  - Introduction: Differentiation between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from benign mimickers is a well-known problem in cytological materials. Recent studies incorporated biological markers into this question and some studies showed that expression of S100P, IMP3, and maspin as well as nonexpression of von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) were significantly correlated with PDAC. In this study, we aimed to investigate diagnostic value of maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL immunostaining in fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of pancreatic lesions.Materials and Method: In all, 33 cases of FNAB cell blocks of PDAC and 34 cases of surgical non-neoplastic pancreas specimens which were retrieved from the archives slides from 2007 to 2011 were included in this study. All the cases were stained with maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL. Expression patterns of markers were scored and compared with benign mimickers. Test performance of each antibody and possible antibody combinations were also evaluated.Results: The study was composed of 33 PDAC and 34 control cases (8 chronic pancreatitis, 3 mucinous cystic neoplasm, and 23 nontumoral pancreatic tissue of PDAC). Diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy in S100P, IMP3, and maspin was 84.8%, 81.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. Specificity of these three markers was 100%. Sensitivity and specificity of pVHL for detecting nontumoral pancreatic tissue were 100% and 81.8%, respectively. When maspin, IMP3, and S100P expression were used together as triple test, sensitivity was 62.5% and specificity 100%. However, when any two of each three markers were evaluated (triple test/dual response), sensitivity reached 93.8% and specificity 100%.Conclusion: We observed that dual response in triple test (positive staining with two of these three markers) of maspin, IMP3, and S100P immunocytochemistry is very sensitive and specific in differential diagnosis of PDA and non-neoplastic pancreatic lesions. pVHL may have an additional role, when triple assessment is not satisfactory.

N2  - E2-EPF ubiquitin carrier protein (UCP) is a member of an E2 family of enzymes that catalyzes the ligation of ubiquitin to proteins targeted for destruction by the proteasome. UCP is overexpressed in common human cancers, suggesting its involvement in oncogenesis, but a physiologic target of UCP has not been identified. In a recent report published in Nature Medicine, Jung et al. identified von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein, which targets the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for ubiquitin-mediated destruction, as a bona fide substrate of UCP and demonstrated a potential pVHL-HIF pathway-dependent role for UCP in cancer development. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - An absolute erythrocytosis is present when the red cell mass is raised and the haematocrit is elevated above prescribed limits. Causes of an absolute erythrocytosis can be primary where there is an intrinsic problem in the bone marrow and secondary where there an event outside the bone marrow driving erythropoiesis. This can further be divided into congenital and acquired causes. There remain an unexplained group idiopathic erythrocytosis. Investigation commencing with thorough history taking and examination and then investigation depending on initial features is required. Clear simple criteria for polycythaemia vera are now defined. Those who do not fulfil these criteria require further investigation depending on the clinical scenario and initial results. The erythropoietin level provides some guidance as to the direction in which to proceed and the order and extent of investigation necessary in an individual patient. It should thus be possible to make an accurate diagnosis in the majority of patients. © 2008 The Author.

N2  - Dysregulated mitochondrial function is associated with the pathology of a wide range of diseases including renal disease and cancer. Thus, investigating regulators of mitochondrial function is of particular interest. Previous work has shown that the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory chain function. pVHL is best known as an E3-ubiquitin ligase for the alpha-subunit of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family of dimeric transcription factors. In normoxia, pVHL recognizes and binds hydroxylated HIF-alpha (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In this way, HIF transcriptional activity is tightly controlled at the level of HIF-alpha protein stability. At least 80% of clear cell renal carcinomas exhibit inactivation of the VHL gene, which leads to HIF-alpha protein stabilization and constitutive HIF activation. Constitutive HIF activation in renal carcinoma drives tumor progression and metastasis. Reconstitution of wild-type VHL protein (pVHL) in pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells not only suppresses HIF activation and tumor growth, but also enhances mitochondrial respiratory chain function via mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that pVHL regulates mitochondrial function when re-expressed in pVHL-defective 786O and RCC10 renal carcinoma cells distinct from its regulation of HIF-alpha. Expression of CHCHD4, a key component of the disulphide relay system (DRS) involved in mitochondrial protein import within the intermembrane space (IMS) was elevated by pVHL re-expression alongside enhanced expression of respiratory chain subunits of complex I (NDUFB10) and complex IV (mtCO-2 and COX IV). These changes correlated with increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and dynamic changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism. Knockdown of HIF-2alpha also led to increased OCR, and elevated expression of CHCHD4, NDUFB10, and COXIV in 786O cells. Expression of pVHL mutant proteins (R200W, N78S, D126N, and S183L) that constitutively stabilize HIF-alpha but differentially promote glycolytic metabolism, were also found to differentially promote the pVHL-mediated mitochondrial phenotype. Parallel changes in mitochondrial morphology and the mitochondrial network were observed. Our study reveals a new role for pVHL in regulating CHCHD4 and mitochondrial function in renal carcinoma cells.

N2  - Megadose vitamin C (Vc) is one of the most enduring alternative treatments for diverse human diseases and is deeply engrafted in popular culture. Preliminary studies in the 1970s described potent effects of Vc on prolonging the survival of patients with terminal cancer, but these claims were later criticized. An improved knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of Vc and recent reports using cancer cell lines have renewed the interest in this subject. Despite these findings, using Vc as an adjuvant for anticancer therapy remains questionable, among other things because there is no proper mechanistic understanding. Here, we show that a Warburg effect triggered by activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway greatly enhances Vc-induced toxicity in multiple cancer cell lines, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective renal cancer cells. HIF increases the intracellular uptake of oxidized Vc through its transcriptional target glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), synergizing with the uptake of its reduced form through sodium-dependent Vc transporters. The resulting high levels of intracellular Vc induce oxidative stress and massive DNA damage, which then causes metabolic exhaustion by depleting cellular ATP reserves. HIF-positive cells are particularly sensitive to Vc-induced ATP reduction because they mostly rely on the rather inefficient glycolytic pathway for energy production. Thus, our experiments link Vc-induced toxicity and cancer metabolism, providing a new explanation for the preferential effect of Vc on cancer cells.

N2  - Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) facilitates automated mutation scanning of PCR products with the ability to detect nearly 100% of sequence variants including single nucleotide substitutions and small insertions or deletions. It has particular application for genetic screening in inherited conditions; both for the initial identification of a mutation in disease carriers followed by sequence analysis, and for screening "at-risk" individuals prior to the development of disease in families with a known mutation. Specifically, in familial cancer syndromes, DHPLC has been reported as a genetic screening tool for the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1), von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL), Cowden syndrome (PTEN), and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia types 1 and 2 (MEN1 and RET). This chapter focuses on the methodologies specific to the WAVE System for Mutation Detection 2100 (Transgenomic Inc., Omaha, NE, USA) and highlights the use of Navigator software (Transgenomic Inc.), including data analysis with scatter graphs.

N2  - A partial cDNA sequence for the gene linked to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome was reported in 1993. Mutation or loss of both VHL alleles has been documented in sporadic renal cell carcinomas and in the neoplasms that arise in von Hippel-Lindau kindreds. We have determined that the protein product of the VHL gene is an approximately 30 kilodalton cytoplasmic protein. The renal carcinoma cell line 786-O is known to harbour a VHL mutation and, as shown here, fails to produce a wild-type VHL protein. Reintroduction of wild-type, but not mutant, VHL into these cells had no demonstrable effect on their growth in vitro but inhibited their ability to form tumours in nude mice.

N1  - Veronica: no genotype-phenotype data
N2  - Cullin-based E3 ligases are a large family of multi-subunit ubiquitin ligases with diverse cellular functions, including the regulation of the cell cycle, of the DNA damage response, and of various transcription factors. These ligases are composed of one of six mammalian cullin homologs (Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4a, Cul4b, and Cul5), the Ring finger containing protein Roc1/Rbx1, and cullin homolog-specific adaptor and substrate recognition subunits. To be active, cullin-based ligases require the covalent modification of a conserved lysine residue in the cullin protein with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8. We show in this study that in intact cells Cul1 neddylation is dependent on binding to adaptor proteins and substrate recognition subunits. Mutant Cul1 that is unable to recruit adaptor and substrate recognition subunits exhibits markedly reduced neddylation, and inhibiting binding of adaptor and substrate recognition subunits to wild type Cul1 reduces Nedd8 modification. This regulatory mechanism also extends to other cullin-based E3 ligases, including Cul2, Cul3, and Cul4a. The regulation of cullin neddylation by adaptor proteins and substrate recognition subunits in cells was found to be independent of both CAND1 and the COP9 signalosome, two negative regulators of cullin Nedd8 modification. Using hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a substrate of the Elongin B/C-Cul2-VHL ligase, we demonstrate the critical role of substrate binding to promote Cul2 neddylation in a manner that does not require substrate ubiquitination but may involve a conformational change. These findings suggest a mechanism through which availability of substrate recognition subunits and substrates can regulate the ubiquitin ligase activity. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

N1  - Veronica: no phenotype-genotype data
N2  - Human renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) is frequently associated with loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor (pVHL), which inhibits ubiquitylation and degradation of the alpha subunits of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor. pVHL also ubiquitylates the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, Rpb1, phosphorylated on serine 5 (Ser5) within the C-terminal domain (CTD). A hydroxylated proline 1465 within an LXXLAP motif located N-terminal to the CTD allows the interaction of Rpb1 with pVHL. Here we report that in RCC cells, pVHL regulates expression of Rpb1 and is necessary for low-grade oxidative-stress-induced recruitment of Rpb1 to the DNA-engaged fraction and for its P1465 hydroxylation, phosphorylation, and nondegradative ubiquitylation. Egln-9-type prolyl hydroxylases, PHD1 and PHD2, coimmunoprecipitated with Rpb1 in the chromatin fraction of VHL<sup>+</sup> RCC cells in response to oxidative stress, and PHD1 was necessary for P1465 hydroxylation while PHD2 had an inhibitory effect. P1465 hydroxylation was required for oxidative-stress-induced Ser5 phosphorylation of Rpb1. Importantly, overexpression of wild-type Rpb1 stimulated formation of kidney tumors by VHL<sup>+</sup> cells, and this effect was abolished by P1465A mutation of Rpb1. These data indicate that through this novel pathway involving P1465 hydroxylation and Ser5 phosphorylation of Rbp1, pVHL may regulate tumor growth.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe pathological and molecular changes of three patients with clinically severe von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-associated retinal hemangioblastoma (RH) with rapid progression. METHODS: Medical records, ocular histopathology, and transmission electron microscopy from three cases of VHL-associated RHs at the National Eye Institute were retrospectively reviewed. One eye of each patient was enucleated. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha and HIF2alpha expressions were identified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All three cases had rapidly growing RHs that were resistant to multiple conventional therapies and two (patients 1 and 2) were also resistant to multiple intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments. Macroscopically, all the enucleated eyes had multiple RHs, serous retinal detachment, severe retinal disorganization and focal hemorrhages. Histopathology showed typical RHs composed of vacuolated foamy VHL cells and capillary networks. Retinal gliosis and hemorrhages were also presented. Additionally, T lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrated in the tumors of two patients resistant to anti-VEGF therapy. Immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR found upregulation of HIF1alpha in the retinal lesions of all eyes. Importantly, upregulation of HIF2alpha was exclusively detected in the two cases with inflammatory infiltration and resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. Ultrastructural images showed autophagy, lipid droplets, glycogen aggregations, and cytoplasmic degeneration in many VHL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the histopathological and molecular pathological findings, autophagy, inflammation, and/or upregulation of HIF2alpha could potentially contribute to the aggressive course of RHs, resulting in the resistance to multiple anti-VEGF and radiation therapies in these patients.

N2  - Background: Early age of onset of 46 year or younger might be associated with hereditary renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, the clinico-pathological features, clinical outcome and genomewide analysis of somatic mutations in this RCC subset remains unknown. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively all clinico-pathological features of earlyonset RCC treated at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital between 2008-2014. In a subset of 12 RCC {medullary (n = 2), oncocytoma (n = 2), clear-cell RCC (ccRCC) (n = 8), mucinous and spindle cell RCC (n = 1}), whole-exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA derived from matched tumornormal pairs, using Agilent human V5 capture and the HiSeq sequencing platform. Paired-end RNA-seq was also carried out in the same dataset for fusion transcript detection. Results: Overall, 79 kidney tumors have been identified including 15 benign tumors and 64 malignant RCC. Six (7.6%) patients had hereditary RCC including three with Von-Hippel Lindau disease. The most frequent malignant RCC subtypes were ccRCC (n = 25), papillary RCC (n = 15) and MITF/TFE translocation RCC (TRCC) (n = 13). Ten patients (15.6%) presented initially with metastatic disease, including 5 with TRCC. Median overall survival of initially metastatic patients with malignant RCC was 28.1 months versus NR for others (p < 0.0001). Median non-synonymous somatic single nucleotide variants were 22 (range, 13-48) and 11 (range, 3-36) in ccRCC and non-ccRCC, respectively (p = ns). In three ccRCC samples arising in the context of VHL disease, no recurrent somatic mutations were identified. In four sporadic ccRCC, 3 and 2 cases showed VHL and PBRM1 mutations, respectively. In young-onset ccRCC, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed enrichment of mutations in genes related to PTEN signaling. No fusion transcripts were identified. Conclusions: Our study charts the distribution of young-onset kidney tumors and reveals that TRCC display the poorest outcome. In addition, we discover that young-onset ccRCC display similar mutational signature but lower mutational load as compared to ccRCC in patients older than 46 years.

N2  - Context: Circulating Rare Cells (CRC) are non-haematological cells circulating in blood. They include Circulating Cancer Cells (CCC) and cells with uncertain malignant features (CRC-UMF) according to cytomorphology. Clear cell renal cell carcinomas frequently bear a mutated Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene.
Aim: To match blind genetic analysis of CRC and tumor samples with CRC cytopathological diagnosis.
Results: 29/30 patients harboured CRC (20 harboured CCC, 29 CRC-UMF) and 25/29 patients carried VHL mutations in their tumour. 205 single CRC (64 CCC, 141 CRC-UMF) provided genetic data. 57/57 CCC and 104/125 CRC-UMF from the 25 patients with VHL-mutated tumor carried the same VHL mutation detected in the tumor. Seven CCC and 16 CRC-UMF did not carry VHL mutations but were found in patients with wild-type VHL tumor tissue.
Conclusions: All the CCC and 83,2% (104/125) of the CRC-UMF were found to carry the same VHL mutation identified in the corresponding tumorous tissue, validating cytopathological identification of CCC in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
Methods: The blood of 30 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma was treated by ISET<sup></sup> for CRC isolation, cytopathology and single-cell VHL mutations analysis, performed blindly and compared to VHL mutations of corresponding tumor tissues and leukocytes.

N1  - Veronica: review
N2  - Emerging data implicates ubiquitination, a post-translational modification, in regulating essential cellular events, one of them being mitosis. In this review we discuss how various E3 ligases modulate the cortical proteins such as dynein, LGN, NuMa, Galpha, along with polymerization, stability, and integrity of spindles. These are responsible for regulating symmetric cell division. Some of the ubiquitin ligases regulating these proteins include PARK2, BRCA1/BARD1, MGRN1, SMURF2, and SIAH1; these play a pivotal role in the correct positioning of the spindle apparatus. A direct connection between developmental or various pathological disorders and the ubiquitination mediated cortical regulation is rather speculative, though deletions or mutations in them lead to developmental disorders and disease conditions.

N2  - Cancer-associated mutations have been identified in the metabolic genes succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), fumarate hydratase (FH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), advancing and challenging our understanding of cellular function and disease mechanisms and providing direct links between dysregulated metabolism and cancer. Some striking parallels exist in the cellular consequences of the genetic mutations within this triad of cancer syndromes, including accumulation of oncometabolites and competitive inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, particularly, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylases, JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases (part of the JMJD family) and the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5methyl cytosine (5mC) DNA hydroxylases. These lead to activation of HIF-dependent oncogenic pathways and inhibition of histone and DNA demethylation. Mutations in FH, resulting in loss of enzyme activity, predispose affected individuals to a rare cancer, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), characterised by benign smooth muscle cutaneous and uterine tumours (leiomyomata) and an aggressive form of collecting duct and type 2 papillary renal cancer. Interestingly, loss of FH activity results in the accumulation of high levels of fumarate that can lead to the non-enzymatic modification of cysteine residues in multiple proteins (succination) and in some cases to their disrupted function. Here we consider that the study of rare diseases such as HLRCC, combining analyses of human tumours and cell lines with in vitro and in vivo murine models has provided novel insights into cancer biology associated with dysregulated metabolism and represents a useful paradigm for cancer research. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal of all the genitourinary cancers, as it is generally refractory to current treatment regimens, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Targeted therapies against critical signaling pathways associated with RCC pathogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, von Hippel - Lindau tumor suppressor and mammalian target of rapamycin, have shown limited efficacy so far. Thus, Wnt signaling, which is known to be intricately involved in the pathogenesis of RCC, has attracted much interest. Several Wnt signaling components have been examined in RCC, and, while studies suggest that Wnt signaling is constitutively active in RCC, the molecular mechanisms differ considerably from other human carcinomas. Increasing evidence indicates that secreted Wnt antagonists have important roles in RCC pathogenesis. Considering these vital roles, it has been postulated - and supported by experimental evidence - that the functional loss of Wnt antagonists, for example by promoter hypermethylation, can contribute to constitutive activation of the Wnt pathway, resulting in carcinogenesis through dysregulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. However, subsequent functional studies of these Wnt antagonists have demonstrated the inherent complexities underlying their role in RCC pathogenesis. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N2  - To further study the characteristics of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in young patients and better define their biological features, 46 RCCs of patients younger than 25 years were morphologically and immunohistochemically characterized with follow-up. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene region and screening for VHL gene mutations were performed in all tumors. Applying the 2004 WHO classification for RCC, there were 19 Xp11.2 translocation RCCs, 9 clear cell RCCs, 17 papillary RCCs, and 1 unclassified RCC. All 19 Xp11.2 translocation RCCs showed moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFE3. None had TFEB immunoreactivity. One Xp11.2 translocation RCC had an unreported morphology with empty or ground glass nuclei, occasional nuclear grooves, inconspicuous nucleoli and abundant mucinous material in stroma.VHL gene analysis revealed deletions at 3p25-26 in 1 clear cell RCC and 1 papillary type 2 RCC. The papillary type 2 RCC was also presented with a family history of VHL disease and found a germline mutation G -> C on a splicing site at position 553+5. The present case widens the spectrum of microscopic features to be found in VHL-associated RCC. There were no VHL mutations in the remaining 45 RCCs. Statistical analysis of stage and outcome revealed that TFE+ pediatric RCCs were significantly more frequently associated with a higher pTNM pT3/pT4 stage and a poorer outcome than TFE-RCCs (P < .05). Owing to the already known aggressive behavior of these Xp11.2 translocation RCCs, patients with TFE+ pediatric RCCs should benefit from a stricter follow-up.

N2  - Mechanisms for bladder carcinogenesis and the development of recurrentbladder cancer remain unclear. Aberrant methylation of the 5' CpG island is thought to play an important role in the inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes in cancer. To study whether specific or bulk hypermethylation predicts intrabladder recurrence, we determined the frequency of aberrant promoter hypermethylation of seven genes, hMLH1, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), p16, Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GST-P1) and E-cadherin in 55 superficial bladder cancers and 5 normal urothelial epithelia by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). These patients of superficial bladder cancer had been followed prospectively by cystoscopy. Simultaneous hypermethylation of three genes or more among the seven genes was observed in 2 (7%) of 30 patients in the nonrecurrence group and 7 (28%) of 25 patients in the recurrence group. There was a significant concordance between the number of methylated genes and the development of recurrence (P = 0.012). In particular, the recurrence rate for 24 months was 88% for hypermethylation of DAP-kinase and 28% for nonmethylation of DAP-kinase. Hypermethylation of DAP-kinase is, therefore, a strong indicator of the superficial bladder cancer associated with a high recurrence rate (P < 0.001; hazards ratio, 7.01). Our results suggest that hypermethylation of DAP-kinase might be a useful prognostic marker for disease recurrence in superficial bladder cancers.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by germline mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Affected individuals are predisposed to development of multiple neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions of different organs. A "second hit," which is usually represented by deletion in the wild-type VHL allele at 3p25, is necessary for initiation of tumor formation. The impact of the size of this deletion is thought to be critical, because other tumor suppressor genes are located nearby, but this has not yet been studied in detail. We mapped the deletion size of the "second hit" in microdissected tissue from 16 different VHL-associated lesions from the same patient using 10 polymorphic chromosome 3 markers. We found that the deletion size is highly variable, ranging from short deletions around the VHL gene to complete loss of the chromosome 3. The deletion sizes are not correlated with the site of the germline mutation, the affected organ, or the type or biological behavior of the tumor. Even preneoplastic cystic structures may harbor entire loss of the chromosome 3, suggesting that loss of VHL gene function alone is not immediately causative for neoplastic growth, but further events, either mutations and deletions in other chromosomes or epigenetic or other than genetic phenomena, are required for tumor formation.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although pathological findings including tumour grade and tumour-node-metastasis stage provide prognostic information, the outcome for patients with renal cell carcinoma is occasionally unpredictable. Many studies have been undertaken to improve prediction of the prognosis of renal cell carcinoma, along with efforts to clarify the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma at the molecular level. This article reviews the advances in renal cell carcinoma research relevant to pathology published between 1 May 2002 and 30 April 2003. RECENT FINDINGS: The establishment of a strict tumour grading system or adding microscopic venous invasion or tumour necrosis is potentially useful for predicting patient outcomes. The contribution of the von Hippel-Lindau-related pathway in early carcinogenesis has been partly revealed with regard to angiogenesis and cell cycle control. Tumour development in renal cell carcinoma can be considered as accumulating heterogenous molecular events related to cytokine production, cell cycle control, anti-apoptotic signal machinery and angiogenesis. SUMMARY: Finding the target genes related to the von Hippel-Lindau pathway may explain the resistance of chemotherapy, and also provide a clue to finding a novel therapeutic option. Molecular targeting therapy can be applicable after more general molecules leading to tumour development and the metastasis of renal cell carcinoma have been identified. [References: 36]

N2  - The tumor suppressor gene, Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), is frequently mutated in the most common form of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). In hypoxic conditions, or when there is a VHL mutation, the hypoxia inducible factors, HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha, are stabilized and transcribe a panel of genes associated with cancer such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Recent studies in clear cell kidney cancer have suggested that HIF2alpha, but not HIF1alpha, is the critical oncoprotein in the VHL pathway. Therefore, targeting HIF2alpha could provide a potential therapeutic approach for patients with advanced CCRCC. Since iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) is known to inhibit the translation of HIF2alpha, we investigated whether Tempol, a stable nitroxide that activates IRP1 towards IRE-binding, might have a therapeutic effect on a panel of human CCRCC cells expressing both HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha. We first evaluated the protein expression of HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha in 15 different clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines established from patient tumors in our laboratory. Tempol decreased the expression of HIF2alpha, and its downstream targets in all the cell lines of the panel. This effect was attributed to a dramatic increase of IRE-binding activity of IRP1. Several cell lines were found to have an increased IRP1 basal activity at 20% O2 compared to 5% O2, which may lower HIF2alpha expression in some of the cell lines in a VHL-independent manner. Taken together our data identify Tempol as an agent with potential therapeutic activity targeting expression of HIF2alpha in VHL-deficient clear cell kidney cancer and illustrate the importance of studying biochemical processes at relevant physiological O2 levels.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for several tumor suppressor genes (including loci on 3p, 1p, and 17p,) has been documented in surgical specimens of adrenal cortical carcinomas (ACCA) without accompanying losses in benign hyperplastic and adenomatous adrenal cortical lesions (ACL). This disparate pattern of LOH raises the possibility of exploitation of these differences for diagnostic utilization. Cytologic differentiation of benign versus malignant ACL may be impossible based solely on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) material. The authors attempted to extrapolate the genetic findings on surgical specimens to FNA specimens of ACL to determine whether LOH studies could be utilized as a definitive diagnostic tool. METHODS: Microdissection of archival material was performed on FNAs of ten ACCAs (stained with the Papanicolaou and Diff-Quik stains) with corresponding histologic material (stained with hematoxylin and eosin), one FNA of a benign ACL, and three touch preparations of benign adrenal cortex. LOH analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with flanking markers for the following putative tumor suppressor genes: p53 (17p13; TP53), 1p (1p36; D1S165), and the von Hippel-Lindau gene at 3p25 (D3S1038 and D3S1110). RESULTS: Similar results were obtained with cytologic and histologic material. As expected, benign ACL showed no LOH for the markers examined. Of the informative ACCA cases, 70% showed LOH for at least 1 of the 3 markers tested on both FNA and histologic samples. For all cases with amplifiable DNA, there was a 100% concordance rate for LOH between cytologic and histologic material, with at least 7 of the 10 cytologic samples originating from metastatic lesions and all of the surgical material originating from the primary adrenal neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the combination of microdissection and PCR for LOH of p53, 1p, and 3p25 from FNA material has the potential to be utilized to distinguish ACCA from benign ACL in informative cases. It also shows a 100% concordance rate between metastatic and primary ACCAs for the losses observed, a finding that can be extremely useful for the definitive identification of metastatic lesions. Archival cytologic preparations of ACCA are a reliable source of DNA for LOH studies.

N2  - von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome linked to alteration of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Affected patients are predisposed to develop pheochromocytomas and cystic and solid tumors of the kidney, CNS, pancreas, retina, and epididymis. However, organ involvement varies considerably among families and has been shown to correlate with the underlying germline alteration. Clinically, we observed a paradoxically lower prevalence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients with complete germline deletion of VHL. To determine if a relationship existed between the type of VHL deletion and disease, we retrospectively evaluated 123 patients from 55 families with large germline VHL deletions, including 42 intragenic partial deletions and 13 complete VHL deletions, by history and radiographic imaging. Each individual and family was scored for cystic or solid involvement of CNS, pancreas, and kidney, and for pheochromocytoma. Germline deletions were mapped using a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative Southern and Southern blot analysis. An age-adjusted comparison demonstrated a higher prevalence of RCC in patients with partial germline VHL deletions relative to complete deletions (48.9 vs. 22.6%, p=0.007). This striking phenotypic dichotomy was not seen for cystic renal lesions or for CNS (p=0.22), pancreas (p=0.72), or pheochromocytoma (p=0.34). Deletion mapping revealed that development of RCC had an even greater correlation with retention of HSPC300 (C3orf10), located within the 30-kb region of chromosome 3p, immediately telomeric to VHL (52.3 vs. 18.9%, p <0.001), suggesting the presence of a neighboring gene or genes critical to the development and maintenance of RCC. Careful correlation of genotypic data with objective phenotypic measures will provide further insight into the mechanisms of tumor formation.

N2  - Primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) genetic heterogeneity may lead to an underestimation of the mutational burden detected from a single site evaluation. We sought to characterize the extent of clonal branching involving key tumor suppressor mutations in primary ccRCC and determine if genetic heterogeneity could limit the mutation profiling from a single region assessment. Ex vivo core needle biopsies were obtained from three to five different regions of resected renal tumors at a single institution from 2012 to 2013. DNA was extracted and targeted sequencing was performed on five genes associated with ccRCC (von-Hippel Lindau [VHL], PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, and KDM5C). We constructed phylogenetic trees by inferring clonal evolution based on the mutations present within each core and estimated the predictive power of detecting a mutation for each successive tumor region sampled. We obtained 47 ex vivo biopsy cores from 14 primary ccRCC's (median tumor size 4.5 cm, IQR 4.0-5.9 cm). Branching patterns of various complexities were observed in tumors with three or more mutations. A VHL mutation was detected in nine tumors (64%), each time being present ubiquitously throughout the tumor. Other genes had various degrees of regional mutational variation. Based on the mutations' prevalence we estimated that three different tumor regions should be sampled to detect mutations in PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1, and/or KDM5C with 90% certainty. The mutational burden of renal tumors varies by region sampled. Single site assessment of key tumor suppressor mutations in primary ccRCC may not adequately capture the genetic predictors of tumor behavior.

N2  - Deletions involving 3p are believed to be typical for conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma (cRCC), with confirmed and suspected targets being the VHL and FHIT tumor suppressor genes, respectively. By contrast, 3p deletions are felt to be rare in papillary RCC (pRCC) and chromophobe RCC (chRCC); however, this belief is based on relatively scant data. In particular, 3p14.2 deletions, possibly resulting in FHIT inactivation, have been rarely studied in pRCC or chRCC even though they may be relevant in early renal tumorigenesis. We therefore examined 3p deletion rates and patterns in pRCC and chRCC with particular attention to 3p14.2. We examined 16 chRCCs and 27 pRCCs for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p25-26 and 3p14.2 using 13 well-mapped microsatellite markers. Those pRCC with LOH at 3p25-26 were also screened for VHL gene mutations. The results were correlated with tumor histology and patient outcome and compared with data we had obtained previously on cRCC. We found similar overall 3p LOH rates in pRCC (59%), chRCC (86.6%), and cRCC (75.8%). In pRCC and chRCC, LOH at 3p25-26 was more common than at 3p14.2, whereas the converse was true for cRCC. In the pRCC with 3p25-26 LOH, we confirmed that this was not associated with mutations of the VHL gene. At 3p14.2, LOH rates of pRCC were lower than those of cRCC and chRCC (p<0.02). All morphotypes showed a predominately interstitial LOH pattern, which was most pronounced in the 3p14.2 region in cRCC. 3p LOH in chRCC was associated with improved patient outcome, mirroring our previous cRCC data. We conclude that 3p LOH is a universal phenomenon in RCC, but has different underlying mechanisms, molecular targets, and implications in the different morphotypes, although FHIT inactivation may play a role in both cRCC and chRCC tumorigenesis.

N2  - Objective: Discovery of curative therapies for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is hampered by lack of authentic preclinical models. Tumorgrafts, generated by direct implantation of patient-derived tissues into mice, have demonstrated superior ability to predict therapeutic response. We evaluated "tissue slice grafts" (TSGs) as an improved tumorgraft model of RCC. Materials and methods: Cores of fresh RCC were precision-cut at 300mum and implanted under the renal capsule of RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>gammaC<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Engraftment rate, histology, biomarker expression, genetic fidelity, and metastatic potential were evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was tested as a noninvasive method to measure tumor volume, and response to a targeted therapy was determined. Results: All 13 cases of RCC engrafted and displayed characteristic histology and biomarkers. TSG volume quantified noninvasively by MRI highly correlated with graft weights, providing a unique tool for monitoring orthotopic growth. Moreover, in 2 cases, cancer cells from TSGs metastasized to clinically relevant sites, including bone. Microarray analysis and DNA sequencing demonstrated a high degree of correlation of global gene expression and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) status between TSGs and parental tumors. Treatment of TSGs with sunitinib significantly decreased graft weight and mean vessel density compared with controls. Conclusion: The TSG model of RCC faithfully recapitulates tumor pathology, gene expression, genetic mutation, and drug response. The high engraftment rate and metastatic potential of this authentic model, in conjunction with the ability to generate large first-generation animal cohorts and to quantitate tumor volume at the orthotopic site by MRI, proffer significant advantages compared with other preclinical platforms. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The molecular determinants of malignant cell behaviours in breast cancer remain only partially understood. Here we show that SHARP1 (also known as BHLHE41 or DEC2) is a crucial regulator of the invasive and metastatic phenotype in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. SHARP1 is regulated by the p63 metastasis suppressor and inhibits TNBC aggressiveness through inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and HIF-2alpha (HIFs). SHARP1 opposes HIF-dependent TNBC cell migration in vitro, and invasive or metastatic behaviours in vivo. SHARP1 is required, and sufficient, to limit expression of HIF-target genes. In primary TNBC, endogenous SHARP1 levels are inversely correlated with those of HIF targets. Mechanistically, SHARP1 binds to HIFs and promotes HIF proteasomal degradation by serving as the HIF-presenting factor to the proteasome. This process is independent of pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor), hypoxia and the ubiquitination machinery. SHARP1 therefore determines the intrinsic instability of HIF proteins to act in parallel to, and cooperate with, oxygen levels. This work sheds light on the mechanisms and pathways by which TNBC acquires invasiveness and metastatic propensity.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas are frequently associated with inherited cancer syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Retinal angioma and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system are hallmarks of VHL, but its clinical variety is remarkably broad. Pheochromocytomas as the sole or first manifestation of VHL are rare but have been observed. In this case report, the authors describe an unusual case of initial collapse, seizures, and hypertensive crisis in a child who later was found to have multiple extraadrenal pheochromocytomas. Molecular diagnostics revealed a novel point mutation in the VHL gene (VHL nt. 406 T-->G). Only 7 months after the first lesions had been removed, a new paraganglioma developed in the contralateral periadrenal region. When encountering pheochromocytomas in children, the clinician should be aware that an associated tumor syndrome might be present, and appropriate molecular screening should be initiated.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Cerebellar haemangioblastoma occurs sporadically or as a component tumour of autosomal dominant von Hippel-Lindau disease. Biallelic inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene, which is located on chromosome 3p, has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of both tumour entities. Mechanisms of VHL inactivation are intragenic mutations, mitotic recombination events, and hypermethylation of the promoter region. The systematic and complete examination of these genetic and epigenetic phenomena in large series of von Hippel-Lindau disease related and sporadic hemangioblastomas has, thus far, not been performed. METHODS: In the largest series to date, 29 von Hippel-Lindau disease associated and 13 sporadic haemangioblastomas were investigated for all suggested inactivating mechanisms of the VHL gene using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and methylation analyses. Additionally, corresponding blood samples of all patients were screened for VHL germline mutations by SSCP and Southern blotting. RESULTS: Germline mutations were identified in 94% of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and their tumours and 62% of these hemangioblastomas showed LOH of chromosome 3p. Of the 13 sporadic tumours, 23% showed a single somatic mutation of the VHL gene that was not present in the germline. 3p LOH was identified in 50% of informative sporadic tumours. No von Hippel-Lindau disease related or sporadic tumour demonstrated VHL promoter hypermethylation. CONCLUSIONS: For most von Hippel-Lindau disease related haemangioblastomas, the inactivation or loss of both alleles of the VHL gene, as predicted by the Knudson two hit theory, is required. However, in a subset of tumours including most sporadic haemangioblastomas, the genetic pathways involved in tumorigenesis have yet to be defined and may represent alterations of a different pathway or pathways.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with leiomyomatous stroma (RCCLS) is a recently recognized entity with indolent biological behavior. The diagnostic implication of absence/presence of VHL gene mutation, VHL hypermethylation, or/and loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3p (LOH 3p) is widely discussed. Criteria for establishing a diagnosis of RCCLS are still lacking. Fifteen RCCLSs were retrieved from our registry. The cases were studied with consideration to the morphology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular genetics. All cases were composed of low-grade epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm arranged in nests intermingled with abundant leiomyomatous stroma. Age range of the patients was 33 to 78 years. The tumor size ranged from 1.5 to 11 cm. Six of the patients were males, and 9, females. Of the 15 tumors sent for molecular genetic testing, only 12 cases were analyzable. All cases were analyzable immunohistochemically. Of 12 of these cases, 5 showed complete absence of VHL gene mutation, VHL hypermethylation, and LOH 3p. Of these 5 cases, 3 were positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK 7). All of the 5 cases were positive for carbonic anhydrase 9, vimentin, and CD10. The remaining 7 of 12 genetically analyzable cases were found to have had VHL hypermethylation, LOH 3p, VHL gene mutation, or a combination of the former 2 characteristics. These 7 cases were positive for vimentin. Variable reactivity was found for CK 7, carbonic anhydrase 9, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, and CD10. In 1 of these 7 cases, gains on chromosomes 7 and 17 as well as hypermethylation of VHL gene were found. This case was considered as clear cell RCC with aberrant status of chromosomes 7 and 17. Conclusions: (1) Leiomyomatous stroma is not specific for the so called RCCLS. It can be seen also in otherwise typical clear cell RCCs. (2) There are no characteristic morphological/immunohistochemical features unique for "RCCLS." (3) Our results indicate that only tumors with the absence of the VHL gene mutation, hypermethylation, and LOH 3p can be diagnosed as RCCLS. (4) Relation of RCCs with a prominent smooth muscle stroma to the renal angiomyoadenomatous tumor/clear cell papillary (tubopapillary) RCC is not clearly evident from our study and has to be further analyzed on larger cohort of the patients.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma is associated with mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Cell lines derived from these tumors cannot exit the cell cycle when deprived of growth factors, and the ability to exit the cell cycle can be restored by the reintroduction of wild-type protein VHL (pVHL). Here, we report that cyclin D1 is overexpressed and remains inappropriately high in during contact inhibition in pVHL-deficient cell lines. In addition, hypoxia increased the expression of cyclin D1 specifically in pVHL-negative cell lines into which pVHL expression was restored. Hypoxic-induction of cyclin D1 was not observed in other pVHL-positive cell lines. This suggests a model whereby in some kidney cell types, pVHL may regulate a proliferative response to hypoxia, whereas the loss of pVHL leads to constitutively elevated cyclin D1 and abnormal proliferation under normal growth conditions.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma represents approximately 3% of adult malignancies and 90-95% of neoplasms arising from the kidney. Many agents that target angiogenesis (e.g., sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab and pazopanib) and mTOR-targeted therapy (e.g., temsirolimus and everolimus) have been approved as first-line agents. The choice of the most suitable treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma depends on the definition of risk. In this article, we reviewed the scientific literature identifying predictive factors on the activity/efficacy of a specific therapy. © 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd.

N2  - Identification of novel biomarkers and targets in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains a priority and one cellular compartment that is a rich potential source of such molecules is the plasma membrane. A shotgun proteomic analysis of cell surface proteins enriched by cell surface biotinylation and avidin affinity chromatography was explored using the UMRC2- renal cancer cell line, which lacks von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene function, to determine whether proteins of interest could be detected. Of the 814 proteins identified ~22% were plasma membrane or membrane-associated, including several with known associations with cancer. This included beta-dystroglycan, the transmembrane subunit of the DAG1 gene product. VHL-dependent changes in the form of beta-dystroglycan were detected in UMRC2-/+VHL transfectants. Deglycosylation experiments showed that this was due to differential sialylation. Analysis of normal kidney cortex and conventional RCC tissues showed that a similar change also occurred in vivo. Investigation of the expression of genes involved in glycosylation in UMRC2-/+VHL cells using a focussed microarray highlighted a number of enzymes involved in sialylation; upregulation of bifunctional UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) was validated in UMRC2- cells compared with their +VHL counterparts and also found in conventional RCC tissue. These results implicate VHL in the regulation of glycosylation and raise interesting questions regarding the extent and importance of such changes in RCC.

Materials and methods: This multi-institutional, multi-reader study included 103 patients (77 men; median age 59 years, range 34-79) with ccRCC examined with CT in 81 patients, MRI in 19, and both CT and MRI in three; images were downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive, an NCI-funded project for genome-mapping and analyses. Imaging features [size (mm), margin (well-defined or ill-defined), composition (solid or cystic), necrosis (for solid tumors: 0%, 1%-33%, 34%-66% or >66%), growth pattern (endophytic, <50% exophytic, or >=50% exophytic), and calcification (present, absent, or indeterminate)] were reviewed independently by three readers blinded to mutational data. The association of imaging features with mutational status (VHL, BAP1, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, and MUC4) was assessed. Results: Median tumor size was 49 mm (range 14-162 mm), 73 (71%) tumors had well-defined margins, 98 (95%) tumors were solid, 95 (92%) showed presence of necrosis, 46 (45%) had >=50% exophytic component, and 18 (19.8%) had calcification. VHL (n = 52) and PBRM1 (n = 24) were the most common mutations. BAP1 mutation was associated with ill-defined margin and presence of calcification (p = 0.02 and 0.002, respectively, Pearson's chi<sup>2</sup> test); MUC4 mutation was associated with an exophytic growth pattern (p = 0.002, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusions: BAP1 mutation was associated with ill-defined tumor margins and presence of calcification; MUC4 mutation was associated with exophytic growth. Given the known prognostic implications of BAP1 and MUC4 mutations, these results support using radiogenomics to aid in prognostication and management.

N2  - CONTEXT: The recent identification of germline mutations of the mitochondrial complex II genes in variants of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma syndrome has enlarged the number of known causative genes for hereditary pheochromocytoma. A question confronting clinicians is whether they should screen patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas for unsuspected germline mutations of some or all of the seven genes known to cause hereditary paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma (NF1, VHL, RET, MEN1, SDHD, SDHC, and SDHB). A positive answer was suggested by a report that placed the estimate of hereditary disease in apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma as high as 24%. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We applied clinically useful criteria to a review of the literature, defining cases of apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma as those without a suspicious personal or family history, with a focal, unilateral pheochromocytoma, and presenting at age less than 50 yr. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We reduced the overall estimate of unsuspected hereditary pheochromocytoma patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma to approximately 17%. Mutations in only three genes (VHL, SDHB, and SDHD) accounted for almost this entire minority, and unsuspected RET mutation was rare. Costs, coverage by insurance, the potential effect on insurability, and deficient information for populations outside of referral centers should be considered before recommending genetic testing in patients with apparently sporadic presentations of pheochromocytomas. CONCLUSION: We recommend genetic testing for patients with an apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma under the age of 20 yr with family history or features suggestive of hereditary pheochromocytoma or for patients with sympathetic paragangliomas. For individuals who do not meet these criteria, genetic testing is optional. [References: 102]

N2  - Up-frameshift (Upf) factors eliminate aberrant mRNAs containing a specific premature termination codon (PTC). Here, we show that Upf complex facilitates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of products derived from mRNA containing specific PTCs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The efficiency of recruitment of the Upf complex to a PTC product was correlated with the decay of the PTC product. Upf factors promoted the degradation of the human von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, which is an unfolded protein in yeast cells, in a manner that depends on the presence of a faux 3'-UTR. Mass spectrometric analysis and Western blot analysis revealed that Hsp70 was associated with the PTC product. These findings suggest that the Upf complex may be recruited to ribosomes in a faux 3'-UTR-dependent manner and then associates with aberrant products to facilitate their degradation by the proteasome.

N2  - Importance: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated central nervous system (CNS) lesions include hemangioblastomas and endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs), which are associated with significant neurological morbidity and mortality. Recent studies provide critical new biological, diagnostic, and management insights into these tumors. Observations: Biological features, natural history, clinical findings, and management strategies of VHL disease-associated CNS tumors are reviewed. The VHL disease results from a germline mutation of the VHL gene (located on the short arm of chromosome 3), a tumor suppressor that encodes for the VHL protein. Whereas VHL disease is associated with visceral manifestations, CNS lesions are the most common source of morbidity and mortality. Craniospinal hemangioblastomas are almost entirely (99%) found in the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. These tumors arise from multipotent hemangioblasts. Peritumoral cysts frequently underlie the clinical findings associated with hemangioblastomas (>90% of symptomatic tumors). Prospective natural history studies demonstrate that CNS hemangioblastomas typically grow in a saltatory pattern. Due to this unpredictable growth pattern, surgical resection is reserved for symptomatic lesions, as many tumors do not become symptomatic. Recent studies indicate that VHL disease-associated ELSTs cause audiovestibular morbidity (hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo) via 3 mechanisms-otic capsule invasion, intralabyrinthine hemorrhage, and endolymphatic hydrops. Specialized magnetic resonance imaging techniques have been defined to elucidate each of these mechanisms, even when a tumor mass is not identified on imaging. Endolymphatic sac tumors cause audiovestibular morbidity unrelated to size or progression, and resection is now recommended at initial discovery of a tumor mass or a tumor-associated mechanism of morbidity. Conclusions and Relevance: New insights into the development, pathobiological origin, natural history, and long-term outcomes of VHL disease-associated CNS tumors have redefined their management and treatment indications and potentially provide new targeted therapeutic strategies. Resection is reserved for symptomatic hemangioblastomas, but early resection of newly detected ELSTs is now recommended.

N2  - Ectopic epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in facilitating tumorigenesis. Here, we first demonstrated that ANKDD1A is a functional tumor suppressor gene, especially in the hypoxia microenvironment. ANKDD1A directly interacts with FIH1 and inhibits the transcriptional activity of HIF1alpha by upregulating FIH1. In addition, ANKDD1A decreases the half-life of HIF1alpha by upregulating FIH1, decreases glucose uptake and lactate production, inhibits glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) autophagy, and induces apoptosis in GBM cells under hypoxia. Moreover, ANKDD1A is highly frequently methylated in GBM. The tumor-specific methylation of ANKDD1A indicates that it could be used as a potential epigenetic biomarker as well as a possible therapeutic target.

N2  - Hypoxic zones are common features of metastatic tumors. Due to inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL), renal cell carcinomas (RCC) show constitutive stabilization of the alpha subunit of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). Thus, RCC represents a model of chronic hypoxia. Development of the lymphatic network is dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) and lies at the front line of metastatic spreading. Here, we addressed the role of VEGFC in RCC aggressiveness and the regulation of its expression in hypoxia. <b>Methods:</b> Transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation of VEGFC expression was evaluated by qPCR and with reporter genes. The involvement of HIF was evaluated using a siRNA approach. Experimental RCC were performed with immuno-competent/deficient mice using human and mouse cells knocked-out for the VEGFC gene by a CRISPR/Cas9 method. The VEGFC axis was analyzed with an online available data base (TCGA) and using an independent cohort of patients. <b>Results:</b> Hypoxia induced VEGFC protein expression but down-regulated VEGFC gene transcription and mRNA stability. Increased proliferation, migration, over-activation of the AKT signaling pathway and enhanced expression of mesenchymal markers characterized VEGFC-/- cells. VEGFC-/- cells did not form tumors in immuno-deficient mice but developed aggressive tumors in immuno-competent mice. These tumors showed down-regulation of markers of activated lymphocytes and M1 macrophages, and up-regulation of M2 macrophages markers and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1). Over-expression of lymphangiogenic genes including VEGFC was linked to increased disease-free and overall survival in patients with non-metastatic tumors, whereas its over-expression correlated with decreased progression-free and overall survival of metastatic patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study revisited the admitted dogma linking VEGFC to tumor aggressiveness. We conclude that targeting VEGFC for therapy must be considered with caution.

N2  - Loss of the gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is associated with loss of primary cilia and is causally linked to elevated levels of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We developed an image-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay using a dual-labeling image analysis strategy that identifies both the cilium and the basal body. By using this strategy, we screened small-molecule compounds for the targeted rescue of cilia defects associated with VHL deficiency with high accuracy and reproducibility. Bexarotene was identified and validated as a positive regulator of the primary cilium. Importantly, the inability of an alternative retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist to rescue ciliogenesis, in contrast to bexarotene, suggested that multiple bexarotene-driven mechanisms were responsible for the rescue. We found that bexarotene decreased AURKA expression in VHL-deficient cells, thereby restoring the ability of these cells to ciliate in the absence of VHL Finally, bexarotene treatment reduced the propensity of subcutaneous lesions to develop into tumors in a mouse xenograft model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with a concomitant decrease in activated AURKA, highlighting the potential of bexarotene treatment as an intervention strategy in the clinic to manage renal cystogenesis associated with VHL deficiency and elevated AURKA expression.

N2  - The phakomatoses, encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis (ETA; Sturge-Weber Syndrome), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 or von Recklinghausen disease), Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC), oculodermal melanocytosis (ODM), and phakomatosis pigmentovascularis are a group of neurocutaneous disorders that have characteristic systemic and ocular manifestations. Through many different mechanisms, they may cause glaucomatous damage of the optic nerve and subsequent vision loss varying from mild to severe. Glaucoma commonly affects patients with ETA (43-72%), orbito-facial NF1 (23-50%), and ODM (10%). Rarely, it may present as neovascular glaucoma in VHL and TSC. In ETA, glaucoma typically occurs ipsilateral to the port-wine stain, which is caused by a mutation in the GNAQ gene. Specifically, mechanical malformation of the anterior chamber angle and elevated episcleral venous pressure has been implicated as causes of glaucoma in ETA. In NF1, which is caused by a mutation in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, glaucoma commonly occurs ipsilateral to lid plexiform neurofibromas. Histological studies of eyes with NF1 have revealed direct anterior chamber infiltration by neurofibromas, secondary angle closure, fibrovascularization, and developmental angle abnormalities as mechanisms of glaucoma. Lastly, phakomatosis pigmentovascularis is a rare combination of ODM and port-wine stain. Affected patients are at very high risk of developing glaucoma. Despite the many different mechanisms of glaucomatous damage, management follows similar principles as that for congenital glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma. First-line therapy is topical intraocular pressure-lowering eye drops. Surgical management, including goniotomy, trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, and tube shunt placement may be required for more severe cases.

N1  - Yang, PingLi, LiangZhang, WeiLiu, BoLi, LingHuang, HongxingLiu, KunLiu, HuaHuang, HuiyongLi, FengZou, Shucheng Veronica: no VHL mutations
N2  - Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are classified as grade I tumors with uncertain origin according to the World Health Organization's classification system. HBs are characterized by rich mesenchymal cells and abundant capillaries. It has been shown that tumorigenesis of HBs depends on mutational inactivation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, the majority of patients will undergo VHL single gene test, and sequencing scheme is rarely used in clinic. In this study, we described a girl and her father successively found to have HBs within half a year. The results of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing analysis showed that both of them carried heterozygous mutation of RNF139 p.Q650R. This mutation was interpreted as Pathogenic variation based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline. Sanger sequencing was performed with other family members. No mutation on rs118184842 locus of RNF139 gene was found in the samples from the girl's mother, uncle and aunt. This report supports that the novel mutation of RNF139 p.Q650R probably serve as a key role in HBs progression.

N2  - To understand the mechanism of cellular stress in basal-parabasal layers of normal cervical epithelium and during different stages of cervical carcinoma, we analyzed the alterations (expression/methylation/copy number variation/mutation) of HIF-1alpha and its associated genes LIMD1, VHL and VEGF in disease-free normal cervix (n = 9), adjacent normal cervix of tumors (n = 70), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN; n = 32), cancer of uterine cervix (CACX; n = 174) samples and two CACX cell lines. In basal-parabasal layers of normal cervical epithelium, LIMD1 showed high protein expression, while low protein expression of VHL was concordant with high expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF irrespective of HPV-16 (human papillomavirus 16) infection. This was in concordance with the low promoter methylation of LIMD1 and high in VHL in the basal-parabasal layers of normal cervix. LIMD1 expression was significantly reduced while VHL expression was unchanged during different stages of cervical carcinoma. This was in concordance with their frequent methylation during different stages of this tumor. In different stages of cervical carcinoma, the expression pattern of HIF-1alpha and VEGF was high as seen in basal-parabasal layers and inversely correlated with the expression of LIMD1 and VHL. This was validated by demethylation experiments using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in CACX cell lines. Additional deletion of LIMD1 and VHL in CIN/CACX provided an additional growth advantage during cervical carcinogenesis through reduced expression of genes and associated with poor prognosis of patients. Our data showed that overexpression of HIF-1alpha and its target gene VEGF in the basal-parabasal layers of normal cervix was due to frequent inactivation of VHL by its promoter methylation. This profile was maintained during different stages of cervical carcinoma with additional methylation/deletion of VHL and LIMD1.

N2  - Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) latent in mRNA transcripts are thought to modify translation of coding sequences by altering ribosome activity. Not all uORFs are thought to be active in such a process. To estimate the impact of uORFs on the regulation of translation in humans, we first circumscribed the universe of all possible uORFs based on coding gene sequence motifs and identified 1.3 million unique uORFs. To determine which of these are likely to be biologically relevant, we built a simple Bayesian classifier using 89 attributes of uORFs labeled as active in ribosome profiling experiments. This allowed us to extrapolate to a comprehensive catalog of likely functional uORFs. We validated our predictions using in vivo protein levels and ribosome occupancy from 46 individuals. This is a substantially larger catalog of functional uORFs than has previously been reported. Our ranked list of likely active uORFs allows researchers to test their hypotheses regarding the role of uORFs in health and disease. We demonstrate several examples of biological interest through the application of our catalog to somatic mutations in cancer and disease-associated germline variants in humans.

N2  - Inactivation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene is a highly frequent genetic event in the carcinogenesis of central nervous system-(CNS) hemangioblastomas (HBs). The patterning of the similar embryonic vasculogenesis is an increasing concern in HB-neovascularization, and the classic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis driven by VHL loss-of-function from human endothelium have been questioned. With this regard, we identify a distinct, VHL silencing-driven mechanism in which human vascular endothelial cells by means of increasing cell proliferation and decreasing cell apoptosis, is concomitant with facilitating accumulation of Twist1 protein in vascular endothelial cells in vitro. Importantly, this molecular mechanism is also pinpointed in CNS-HBs, and associated with the process of HB-neovascularization. In contrast with recent studies of HB-neovascularization, these modified cells did not endow with the typical features of vasculogenesis, indicating that this is a common angiogenesis implementing the formation of the vascular network. Taken together, these findings suggest that vasculogenesis and angiogenesis may constitute complementary mechanisms for HB-neovascularization, and could provide a rational recognition of single anti-angiogenic intervention including targeting to the Twist1 signalling for HBs.

N2  - The genetic landscape of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) had been investigated extensively but its evolution patterns remained unclear. Here we analyze the clonal architectures of 473 patients from three different populations. We find that the mutational signatures vary substantially across different populations and evolution stages. The evolution patterns of ccRCC have great inter-patient heterogeneities, with del(3p) being regarded as the common earliest event followed by three early departure points: VHL and PBRM1 mutations, del(14q) and other somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) including amp(7), del(1p) and del(6q). We identify three prognostic subtypes of ccRCC with distinct clonal architectures and immune infiltrates: long-lived patients, enriched with VHL but depleted of BAP1 mutations, have high levels of Th17 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells while short-lived patients with high burden of SCNAs have high levels of Tregs and Th2 cells, highlighting the importance of evaluating evolution patterns in the clinical management of ccRCC.

N2  - Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional crosslinking enzyme that displays transamidation, protein disulfide isomerase, protein kinase, as well as GTPase and ATPase activities. TG2 can also act as an adhesion molecule involved in the syndecan and integrin receptor signaling. In recent years, TG2 was implicated in cancer progression, survival, invasion, migration, and stemness of many cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Von Hippel-Lindau mutations leading to the subsequent activation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)-1-mediated signaling pathways, survival signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway resulting in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) metastasis and angiogenesis are the main factors in RCC progression. A number of studies have shown that TG2 was important in HIF-1- and PI3K-mediated signaling, VHL and p53 stabilization, glycolytic metabolism and migratory phenotype in RCC. This review focuses on the role of TG2 in the regulation of molecular pathways nurturing not only the development and propagation of RCC, but also drug-resistance and metastatic potential.

N2  - Hypoxia is the most critical factor for maintaining stemness. During embryonic development, neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in hypoxic niches, and different levels of oxygen pressure and time of hypoxia exposure play important roles in the development of NSCs. Such hypoxic niches exist in adult brain tissue, where the neural precursors originate. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key transcription heterodimers consisting of regulatory alpha-subunits (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, HIF-3alpha) and a constitutive beta-subunit (HIF-beta). Regulation of downstream targets determines the fate of NSCs. In turn, the stability of HIFs-alpha is regulated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), whose activity is principally modulated by PHD substrates like oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), and the co-factors ascorbate (ASC) and ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>). It follows that the transcriptional activity of HIFs is actually determined by the contents of O<sub>2</sub>, alpha-KG, ASC, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>. In normoxia, HIFs-alpha are rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which PHDs, activated by O<sub>2</sub>, lead to hydroxylation of HIFs-alpha at residues 402 and 564, followed by recognition by the tumor suppressor protein von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) as an E3 ligase and ubiquitin labeling. Conversely, in hypoxia, the activity of PHDs is inhibited by low O<sub>2</sub> levels and HIFs-alpha can thus be stabilized. Hence, suppression of PHD activity in normoxic conditions, mimicking the effect of hypoxia, might be beneficial for preserving the stemness of NSCs, and it is clinically relevant as a therapeutic approach for enhancing the number of NSCs in vitro and for cerebral ischemia injury in vivo. This study will review the putative role of PHD inhibitors on the self-renewal of NSCs.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary tumor syndrome in which carriers are at an increased risk of developing a variety of tumors in multiple organ systems. A clinical diagnosis of VHL is determined by the presence of specific clinical manifestations while a molecular genetic diagnosis results from a pathogenic variant in the VHL gene. The majority of mutations occur in VHL coding exons and DNA analysis of these regions has a reported sensitivity of nearly 100%. However, rare variants in the VHL gene promoter may be detected in some cases of suspected VHL disease. We report two cases where VHL promoter variants were detected and describe the role of multi-step mRNA and protein analysis in the diagnostic evaluation of these cases.

N2  - Increasing data implicate iron accumulation in tumorigenesis of the kidney, particularly the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) subtype. The von Hippel Lindau (VHL)/hypoxia inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) axis is uniquely dysregulated in ccRCC and is a major regulator and regulatory target of iron metabolism, yet the role of iron in ccRCC tumorigenesis and its potential interplay with VHL inactivation remains unclear. We investigated whether ccRCC iron accumulation occurs due to increased cell dependency on iron for growth and survival as a result of VHL inactivation. Free iron levels were compared between four VHL-mutant ccRCC cell lines (786-0, A704, 769-P, RCC4) and two benign renal tubule epithelial cell lines (RPTEC, HRCEp) using the Phen Green SK fluorescent iron stain. Intracellular iron deprivation was achieved using two clinical iron chelator drugs, deferasirox (DFX) and deferoxamine (DFO), and chelator effects were measured on cell line growth, cell cycle phase, apoptosis, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels and HIF-alpha transcriptional activity based on expression of target genes CA9, OCT4/POU5F1 and PDGFbeta/PDGFB. Similar assays were performed in VHL-mutant ccRCC cells with and without ectopic wild-type VHL expression. Baseline free iron levels were significantly higher in ccRCC cell lines than benign renal cell lines. DFX depleted cellular free iron more rapidly than DFO and led to greater growth suppression of ccRCC cell lines (>90% at ~30-150micro M) than benign renal cell lines (~10-50% at up to 250micro M). Similar growth responses were observed using DFO, with the exception that a prolonged treatment duration was necessary to deplete cellular iron adequately for differential growth suppression of the less susceptible A704 ccRCC cell line relative to benign renal cell lines. Apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest were identified as potential mechanisms of chelator growth suppression based on their induction in ccRCC cell lines but not benign renal cell lines. Iron chelation in ccRCC cells but not benign renal cells suppressed HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels and transcriptional activity, and the degree and timing of HIF-2alpha suppression correlated with the onset of apoptosis. Restoration of wild-type VHL function in ccRCC cells was sufficient to prevent chelator-induced apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest, indicating that ccRCC susceptibility to iron deprivation is VHL inactivation-dependent. In conclusion, ccRCC cells are characterized by high free iron levels and a cancer-specific dependency on iron for HIF-alpha overexpression, cell cycle progression and apoptotic escape. This iron dependency is introduced by VHL inactivation, revealing a novel interplay between VHL/HIF-alpha dysregulation and ccRCC iron metabolism. Future study is warranted to determine if iron deprivation using chelator drugs provides an effective therapeutic strategy for targeting HIF-2alpha and suppressing tumor progression in ccRCC patients.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) drive angiogenesis and cancer cell growth, contributing to an aggressive tumor phenotype. HIF-alpha protein levels and activity are controlled at the post-translational level by HIF hydroxylases. Hydroxylated HIF-alpha is recognized by the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor and targeted for degradation. The HIF hydroxylases are members of the iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, which require ascorbate as cofactor for activity. Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) harbor mutations in the VHL gene, whereas papillary RCC (pRCC) have a functional VHL. These natural occurring VHL variants in RCC enable the testing, in clinical samples, of the hypothesis that ascorbate modulates HIF-alpha levels through its role as a cofactor for the HIF hydroxylases. We measured ascorbate, HIF-1alpha, and HIF-2alpha protein and HIF downstream targets BNIP3, CA9, cyclin D1, GLUT1, and VEGF (combined to generate the HIF pathway score) in VHL-defective ccRCC (n = 73) and VHL-proficient pRCC human tumor tissue (n = 41). HIF and ascorbate levels were increased in ccRCC and pRCC tumors compared to matched renal cortex. HIF-1 and total HIF pathway activation scores were decreased with higher ascorbate in pRCC tumors (Spearman r = -0.38, p < 0.05 and r = -0.35, p < 0.05). This was not evident for ccRCC tumors. In mechanistic studies in vitro, ascorbate influenced HIF-1 activity in VHL-proficient, but not VHL-defective ccRCC cells. Our results indicate that ccRCC, which lacks a functional VHL, does not respond to ascorbate-mediated modulation of the HIF response. This contrasts with the demonstrated association between ascorbate content and the HIF pathway observed in pRCC and other tumors with a functional VHL. The results support a role for ascorbate as a modulator of HIF activity and tumor aggression in cancer types with a functional hypoxic response.

N2  - Primary cilia are sensory organelles involved in regulation of cellular signaling. Cilia loss is frequently observed in tumors; yet, the responsible mechanisms and consequences for tumorigenesis remain unclear. We demonstrate that cilia structure and function is disrupted in human pheochromocytomas - endocrine tumors of the adrenal medulla. This is concomitant with transcriptional changes within cilia-mediated signaling pathways that are associated with tumorigenesis generally and pheochromocytomas specifically. Importantly, cilia loss was most dramatic in patients with germline mutations in the pseudohypoxia-linked genes SDHx and VHL. Using a pheochromocytoma cell line derived from rat, we show that hypoxia and oncometabolite-induced pseudohypoxia are key drivers of cilia loss and identify that this is dependent on activation of an Aurora-A/ HDAC6 cilia resorption pathway. We also show cilia loss drives dramatic transcriptional changes associated with proliferation and tumorigenesis. Our data provide evidence for primary cilia dysfunction contributing to pathogenesis of pheochromocytoma by a hypoxic/pseudohypoxic mechanism and implicates oncometabolites as ciliary regulators. This is important as pheochromocytomas can cause mortality by mechanisms including catecholamine production and malignant transformation, while hypoxia is a general feature of solid tumors. Moreover, pseudohypoxia-induced cilia resorption can be pharmacologically inhibited, suggesting potential for therapeutic intervention. Copyright © 2019 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.

N2  - Autophagy is a highly conserved, homeostatic process by which cytosolic components reach lysosomes for degradation. The roles played by different autophagic processes in cancer are complex and remain cancer type and stage dependent. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common subtype of kidney cancer and is characterized by the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. Our previous study identified a small compound, STF-62247, as an autophagy-modulating molecule causing selective cytotoxicity for VHL-inactivated cells. This present study investigates the effects of STF-62247 specifically on the macroautophagic flux to better characterize its mechanism of action in RCC. Our results clearly demonstrate that this compound is a potent blocker of late stages of autophagy. We show that inhibiting autophagy by CRISPR knockouts of autophagy-related genes rendered VHL-deficient cells insensitive to STF-62247, uncovering the importance of the autophagic pathway in STF-selective cell death. By exploiting the autofluorescence of STF-62247, we pinpointed its cellular localization to lysosomes. Finally, in response to prolonged STF treatments, we show that VHL-proficient cells are able to surmount the block in late stages of autophagy by restoring their lysosome numbers. Conversely, an increase in autophagic vesicles accompanied by a time-dependent decrease in lysosomes was observed in VHL-deficient cells. This is the first mechanistic study investigating STF-62447's effects on the autophagic flux in RCC. Importantly, our study reclassifies STF-62247 as a blocker of later stages of autophagy and highlights the possibility of blocking this process through lysosome disruption in VHL-mutated RCCs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To detect VHL gene mutation in a pedigree affected with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL). METHODS: Clinical data of the pedigree was reviewed. Patients were subjected to Sanger sequencing to detect mutation of the VHL gene. Structure of pVHL was predicted by 3D modeling using the swiss-model. RESULTS: A novel c.426delT(p.V142fs) [NM_000551] mutation was found in exon 2 of the VHL gene. 3D modeling suggested that the alpha-structure of pVHL is completely absent. CONCLUSION: The novel c.426delT(p.V142fs) mutation probably underlies the VHL in this pedigree.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas (PCC) and paragangliomas (PGL) are rare neuroendocrine neoplasias that develop in the adrenal medulla or in the paravertebral extra-adrenal ganglia. Although they are more commonly benign (~75%) than malignant (~25%), they can be associated with a high degree of morbidity and a substantial mortality due to the hypersecretion of catecholamines or mass effects. Although PCC/PGL occur more commonly as sporadic tumors, about 30-40% are inherited and associated with predisposing germline mutations in more than 15 susceptibility genes. Several classic autosomal dominant tumor syndromes (von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2) are associated with an increased risk for the development of PCC/PGL. Mutations in the TMEM127, MAX, MDH2, FH, and EPAS1/HIF2A genes, among others, can be associated with PCC/PGL, and mutations in the genes encoding the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunits A, B, C, and D or its cofactor SDHAF2 lead to a predisposition to developing paragangliomas (paraganglioma syndrome types 1-5). Mutational analysis of these susceptibility genes is of increasing clinical importance for the early identification and treatment of carriers, as well as genetic counseling. Important insights into the oncogenic events have been obtained through the recently completed comprehensive molecular characterization of 173 PCC/PGL in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. It has revealed a broad spectrum of somatic mutations (CSDE1, HRAS, RET, EPAS1, NF1) or rearrangements (MAML3, BRAF, NGFR, NF1) affecting several genes and pathways. A thorough understanding of the genetic susceptibility factors and the oncogenic mechanisms underlying PCC/PGL is essential for clinical management, genetic counseling, the identification of tumors with an aggressive behavior, and the development of novel targeted therapeutic modalities for metastatic tumors.

N2  - Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are uncommon cancers arising from pancreatic islet cells. Here we report the analysis of gene mutation, copy number, and RNA expression of 57 sporadic well-differentiated pNETs. pNET genomes are dominated by aneuploidy, leading to concordant changes in RNA expression at the level of whole chromosomes and chromosome segments. We observed two distinct patterns of somatic pNET aneuploidy that are associated with tumor pathology and patient prognosis. Approximately 26% of the patients in this series had pNETs with genomes characterized by recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LoH) of 10 specific chromosomes, accompanied by bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation and generally poor clinical outcome. Another ~40% of patients had pNETs that lacked this recurrent LoH pattern but had chromosome 11 LoH, bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation, and universally good clinical outcome. The somatic aneuploidy allowed pathogenic germline variants (e.g., ATM) to be expressed unopposed, with RNA expression patterns showing inactivation of downstream tumor suppressor pathways. No prognostic associations were found with tumor morphology, single gene mutation, or expression of RNAs reflecting the activity of immune, differentiation, proliferative or tumor suppressor pathways. In pNETs, single gene mutations appear to be less important than aneuploidy, with MEN1 the only statistically significant recurrently mutated driver gene. In addition, only one pNET in the series had clearly actionable single nucleotide variants (SNVs) (in PTEN and FLCN) confirmed by corroborating RNA expression changes. The two clinically relevant patterns of LoH described here define a novel oncogenic mechanism and a plausible route to genomic precision oncology for this tumor type. Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene and is accompanied by the development of both benign and malignant tumors. Clarithromycin (CAM) is a widely used anti-inflammatory drug that has also been proven effective for treating some cancers. In this study, we present a novel case of a 38-year-old female patient with VHL syndrome confirmed by computed tomography, with no relevant family history. The patient was only offered close follow-up observation after diagnosis, but was orally administered CAM twice daily when her disease progressed. After treatment for 3 months, her inner ear tumors had stopped growing and her kidney cysts had shrunk. Her pancreatic tumors treated with CAM showed no significant increase in size, and the lymph node swelling disappeared. CAM treatment was interrupted for 2 years and then stopped for 5 years when improvements were noted; the patient's condition thereafter gradually improved and finally stabilized with no obvious side effects. We discuss this case in the context of the published literature and consider the possible mechanisms of CAM action in the treatment of VHL syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with VHL syndrome treated with CAM. Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.

N2  - Background. Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) show the highest degree of heritability in human neoplasms. However, despite the wide number of alterations until now reported in PCCs, it is likely that other susceptibility genes remain still unknown, especially for those PCCs not clearly syndromic. Methods. Whole exome sequencing of tumor DNA was performed on a set of twelve PCCs clinically defined as sporadic. Results. About 50% of PCCs examined had somatic mutations on the known susceptibility VHL, NF1, and RET genes. In addition to these driver events, mutations on SYNE1, ABCC10, and RAD54B genes were also detected. Moreover, extremely rare germline variants were present in half of the sporadic PCC samples analyzed, in particular variants of MAX and SAMD9L were detected in the germline of cases wild-type for mutations in the known susceptibility genes. Conclusions. Additional somatic passenger mutations can be associated with known susceptibility VHL, NF1, and RET genes in PCCs, and a wide number of germline variants with still unknown clinical significance can be detected in these patients. Therefore, many efforts should be aimed to better define the pathogenetic role of all these germline variants for discovering novel potential therapeutic targets for this disease still orphan of effective treatments.

N1  - Veronica: no VHL genotype
N2  - Background: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare but potentially harmful tumors that can vary in their clinical presentation. Tumors may be found due to signs and symptoms, as part of a hereditary syndrome or following an imaging procedure. Objective(s): To investigate potential differences in clinical presentation between PPGLs discovered by imaging (iPPGLs), symptomatic cases (sPPGLs) and those diagnosed during follow-up because of earlier disease/known hereditary mutations (fPPGL). Design(s): Prospective study protocol, which has enrolled patients from six European centers with confirmed PPGLs. Data were analyzed from 235 patients (37 iPPGLs, 36 sPPGLs, 27% fPPGLs) and compared for tumor volume, biochemical profile, mutation status, presence of metastases and self-reported symptoms. iPPGL patients were diagnosed at a significantly higher age than fPPGLs (P < 0.001), found to have larger tumors (P = 0.003) and higher metanephrine and normetanephrine levels at diagnosis (P = 0.021). Significantly lower than in sPPGL, there was a relevant number of selfreported symptoms in iPPGL (2.9 vs 4.3 symptoms, P < 0.001). In 16.2% of iPPGL, mutations in susceptibility genes were detected, although this proportion was lower than that in fPPGL (60.9%) and sPPGL (21.5%). Patients with PPGLs detected by imaging were older, have higher tumor volume and more excessive hormonal secretion in comparison to those found as part of a surveillance program. Presence of typical symptoms indicates that in a relevant proportion of those patients, the PPGL diagnosis had been delayed. Precis: Pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma discovered by imaging are often symptomatic and carry a significant proportion of germline mutations in susceptibility genes.

N2  - A 29-year-old hypertensive male with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome came to the Endocrinology department for evaluation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an adrenal mass, bilateral renal cell carcinoma, and multiple pancreatic cysts. The hormonal investigations for adrenal mass were normal. He underwent left-sided adrenalectomy, and the histopathological report was suggestive of an adrenocortical adenoma. Genetic analysis of VHL gene in this patient revealed a heterogeneous 5' splice site variation of intron 1 of the VHL gene that affects splice site of exon 1 (c. 340 + 1G > A). Adrenocortical adenoma is very rare in VHL syndrome. Only two cases of adrenocortical adenoma in VHL have been reported in the literature, and both were associated with pheochromocytoma. This is probably the first reported case of adrenocortical adenoma in VHL syndrome without accompanying pheochromocytoma.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to determine the frequency of von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) as the underlying cause of retinal hemangioblastoma and to estimate retinal hemangioblastoma incidence and prevalence in a national cohort study. METHODS: Through the national patient register and vHL research database, we identified 81 patients diagnosed with a retinal hemangioblastoma in Denmark between 1977 and 2014. Consent was obtained for 54 living and 10 deceased patients with retinal hemangioblastoma. For each participant, we collected medical records and family information. Almost all (63 of 64) participants were or had previously been tested for mutations in the VHL gene. RESULTS: Overall, 84% of the participants (54 of the 64) had vHL. Compared with the non-vHL patients, the vHL patients had their first retinal hemangioblastoma at a younger age (22.5 vs 40 years), and were more likely to have an asymptomatic first hemangioblastoma (80% vs 20%). Overall, 76% (41 of 54) of the vHL patients had a family history of vHL, while none of the patients without vHL did. Despite the rarity of the disease, on average more than eight new tumours are diagnosed each year due to multiple tumour development in vHL patients. The estimated prevalence of patients with retinal hemangioblastoma was up to 1 in 73 080 individuals. CONCLUSION: In the first national study in which almost all participants were genetically tested, vHL was the underlying cause of retinal hemangioblastoma in 84% of cases; more often than previously reported. We recommend that genetic and clinical vHL screening should be performed in all patients with retinal hemangioblastoma.

N2  - Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are rare and heterogeneous. Therefore, they often remain unrecognized for many years, causing significant disease burden.We here report on four unusual NEN presentations including a metastatic NEN of the kidney, hypoglycemia caused by an insulin-like growth factor-2-oma (previously called non-islet-cell tumor hypoglycemia), multifocal pheochromocytoma in von Hippel Lindau syndrome, and ileal NEN metastatic to the heart. One could say that each one of these tumors were Bblack swans^ and learning about them will increase further awareness of the spectrum of NEN.

N1  - Veronica: review
N2  - In the last two decades, the discovery of various pathways involved in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has led to the development of biologically-driven targeted therapies. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), angiogenic growth factors, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations, and oncogenic microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in the pathogenesis and drug resistance of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. These insights have led to the development of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and immunotherapeutic agents, which have significantly improved the outcomes of patients with advanced RCC. HIF inhibitors will be a valuable asset in the growing therapeutic armamentarium of RCC. Various histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, selenium, and agents like PT2385 and PT2977 are being explored in various clinical trials as potential HIF inhibitors, to ameliorate the outcomes of RCC patients. In this article, we will review the current treatment options and highlight the potential role of selenium in the modulation of drug resistance biomarkers expressed in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) tumors.

Veronica: review
N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the seventh most frequently diagnosed tumor in adults in Europe and represents approximately 2.5% of cancer deaths. The molecular biology underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) development and progression has been a key milestone in the management of this type of tumor. The discovery of Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene alterations that arouse in 50% of ccRCC patients, leads the identification of an intracellular accumulation of HIF and, consequently an increase of VEGFR expression. This change in cell biology represents a new paradigm in the treatment of metastatic renal cancer by targeting angiogenesis. Currently, there are multiple therapeutic drugs available for advanced disease, including therapies against VEGFR with successful results in patients' survival. Other tyrosine kinases' pathways, including PDGFR, Axl or MET have emerged as key signaling pathways involved in RCC biology. Indeed, promising new drugs targeting those tyrosine kinases have exhibited outstanding efficacy. In this review we aim to present an overview of the central role of these tyrosine kinases' activities in relevant biological processes for kidney cancer and their usefulness in RCC targeted therapy development. In the immunotherapy era, angiogenesis is still an "old guy" that the medical community is trying to fight using "new bullets".

N2  - Background: Previous evidence demonstrated that restoration of wild type VHL in human renal cancer cells decreased in vitro NK susceptibility. To investigate on the role of tumoral VHL status versus NK capability in renal cancer patients, 51 RCC patients were characterized for VHL mutational status and NK function. Method(s): VHL mutational status was determined by direct DNA sequencing on tumor tissue. NK cytotoxicity was measured against specific target cells K562, VHL-wild type (CAKI-1) and VHL-mutated (A498) human renal cancer cells through externalization of CD107a and IFN-gamma production. Activating NK receptors, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, DNAM-1, NCAM-1 and FcgammaRIIIa were evaluated through quantitative RT-PCR. RCC tumoral Tregs were characterized as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> and Treg function was evaluated as inhibition of T-effector proliferation. Result(s): VHL mutations were detected in 26/55 (47%) RCC patients. IL-2 activated whole-blood samples (28 VHL-WT-RCC and 23 VHL-MUT-RCC) were evaluated for NK cytotoxicity toward human renal cancer cells A498, VHL-MUT and CAKI-1, VHL-WT. Efficient NK degranulation and increase in IFN-gamma production was detected when IL-2 activated whole-blood from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were tested toward A498 as compared to CAKI-1 cells (CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 7 +/- 2% vs 1 +/- 0.41%, p = 0.015; IFN-gamma<sup>+</sup>NK: 6.26 +/- 3.4% vs 1.78 +/- 0.9% respectively). In addition, IL-2 activated NKs induced higher CD107a exposure in the presence of RCC autologous tumor cells or A498 as compared to SN12C (average CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 4.7 and 2.7% vs 0.3% respectively at 10E:1 T ratio). VHL-MUT-RCC tumors were NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells infiltrated and expressed high NKp30 and NKp46 receptors as compared to VHL-WT-RCC tumors. A significant lower number of Tregs was detected in the tumor microenvironment of 13 VHL-MUT-RCC as compared to 13 VHL-WT-RCC tumors (1.84 +/- 0.36% vs 3.79 +/- 0.74% respectively, p = 0.04). Tregs isolated from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were less suppressive of patients T effector proliferation compared to Tregs from VHL-WT-RCC patients (Teff proliferation: 6.7 +/- 3.9% vs 2.8 +/- 1.1%). Conclusion(s): VHL tumoral mutations improve NKs effectiveness in RCC patients and need to be considered in the evaluation of immune response. Moreover therapeutic strategies designed to target NK cells could be beneficial in VHL-mutated-RCCs alone or in association with immune checkpoints inhibitors. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Aim: BAP1 is frequently mutated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with a definitive role still unclear. Method(s): In silico analysis of BAP1-mutant and wild-type gene enrichment and functional annotation in TCGA-KIRC dataset was performed. Target gene was studied based on functional clustering and was knowledge-based. Validation using in-house pathological sections were performed immunohistochemically. In vitro and in vivo studies on target gene were performed. Result(s): The TCGA ccRCC dataset included 534 ccRCC samples. BAP1 was frequently mutated and more frequently downregulated in ccRCC compared to normal kidney tissue or benign renal tumors. In the analysis between samples with BAP1 mutation (N = 33) and pan-negative (N = 33), we found that cancers with BAP1 mutation was significantly enriched for 14 pathways, of which 3 were DNA repair pathways, in which EZH2 played a role. CcRCC patients with lower BAP1 expression had poor prognosis and showed higher EZH2 expression, which also conferred worsened survival. Genetic and pharmaceutical inhibition of EZH2 not only inhibited BAP1-mutatn ccRCC cell viability and invasion but also abrogated genetic replenishing of BAP1 expression. Validation cohort encompassing 62 ccRCC samples confirmed the worsened phenotype for cases with higher EZH2 expression and significant positive correlation between expressions of EZH2 and BAP1. EZH2 inhibitor also inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse model with BAP1-mutated ccRCC cells with unremarkable toxicity. Conclusion(s): CcRCC with decreased BAP1 level has poor prognosis and is associated with higher EZH2 expression. Inhibition of EZH2 in BAP1-mutated entity holds promise for further investigation.

N2  - AIMS: Hypoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH), a potentially fatal disorder characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular hypertrophy. However, how they are linked in the context of PH is not completely understood. We, therefore, investigated the role of the NADPH oxidase subunit p22phox in the response to hypoxia both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We found that hypoxia decreased ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of p22phox dependent on prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein von Hippel Lindau (pVHL), which resulted in p22phox stabilization and accumulation. p22phox promoted vascular proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis under normoxia and hypoxia. Increased levels of p22phox were also detected in lungs and hearts from mice with hypoxia-induced PH. Mice harboring a point mutation (Y121H) in the p22phox gene, which resulted in decreased p22phox stability and subsequent loss of this protein, were protected against hypoxia-induced PH. Mechanistically, p22phox contributed to ROS generation under normoxia, hypoxia, and hypoxia/reoxygenation. p22phox increased the levels and activity of HIF1alpha, the major cellular regulator of hypoxia adaptation, under normoxia and hypoxia, possibly by decreasing the levels of the PHD cofactors ascorbate and iron(II), and it contributed to the downregulation of the tumor suppressor miR-140 by hypoxia. INNOVATION: These data identify p22phox as an important regulator of the hypoxia response both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidases contribute to the pathophysiology of PH induced by hypoxia.

N2  - The majority of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are sporadic while 10-15% are attributable to one of several familial cancer syndromes. Hereditary forms are more commonly associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type I and von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. However, patients with Tuberous sclerosis complex also have an increased incidence of PNETs. More often this has been reported in patients with TSC2 variants. In this case report, we summarize the literature regarding PNETs associated with Tuberous sclerosis complex, as well as present a case of a patient with a TSC1 variant and a PNET. This case highlights the association of TSC1 gene variants with these tumors and emphasizes the importance of considering such diagnoses in this patient population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hemangioblastomas (HB) are benign tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) that can appear sporadic or as part of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. It is often curable with surgical resection, but upon relapse, the disease exhibits a treatment-refractory course. CASE REPORT: A patient treated for sporadic cerebellar HB relapsed 12 years post-surgery. She developed disseminated disease throughout the CNS, including leptomeningeal manifestations. Repeat surgery and craniospinal radiation therapy were unsuccessful. CONCLUSION: This case is in line with previous publications on disseminated non-VHL HB. Available treatment options are inefficient, emphasizing the need for improved understanding of HB biology to identify therapeutic targets.

N2  - <b>Rationale:</b> Aberrant bronchial epithelium-fibroblast communication is essential for the airway remodeling that contributes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exosomes have emerged as novel mediators of intercellular communication, but their role in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced COPD is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of exosomal miR-21 in the dysfunctional epithelium-fibroblast cross-talk caused by CS. <b>Methods:</b> Normal or CS extract (CSE)-treated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were co-cultured with bronchial fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells). Exosomes were obtained from culture media or serum by use of commercial kits. The size distribution and concentration of exosomes were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis using a ZetaView particle tracker from ParticleMetrix. Inhibition of miR-21 levels by tail vein injection of antagomir-21 into mice exposed to CS was used to demonstrate the role of miR-21 in airway remodeling leading to COPD in animals. <b>Results:</b> For MRC-5 cells, co-culture with CSE-treated HBE cells or with exosomes derived from CSE-treated HBE cells resulted in the myofibroblast differentiation phenotype. Exosomal miR-21 was responsible for myofibroblast differentiation through hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) signaling by targeting the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL); HIF-1alpha transcriptionally regulated the alpha-SMA gene. For mice, downregulation of miR-21 prevented CS-induced airway remodeling. The levels of exosomal miR-21 were high in sera of smokers and COPD patients and inversely correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC. <b>Conclusion:</b> We demonstrate that CS triggers the modification of exosome components and identify miR-21 derived from bronchial epithelial cells as a mediator of myofibroblast differentiation through the pVHL/HIF-1alpha signaling pathway, which has potential value for diagnosis and treatment of COPD.

N2  - LncRNA H19 encoded by the H19 imprinting gene plays an important regulatory role in the cell. Recently study has found that in hypoxic cells, the expression of H19 gene changes, and the transcription factors and protein involved in the expression change accordingly. Through the involvement of specific protein 1 (SP1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) binds directly to the H19 promoter and induces the up-regulation of H19 expression under hypoxic conditions. The tumor suppressor protein p53 may also mediate the expression of the H19 gene, in part by interfering with HIF-la activity under hypoxia stress. The miR675-5p encoded by exon 1 of H19 promotes hypoxia response by driving the nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha and reducing the expression of VHL gene, which is a physiological HIF-1alpha inhibitor. In addition, under the condition of hypoxia, the expression of transporter on cell membrane changes, and the transition of the intracellular glucose metabolism pathway from aerobic oxidation to anaerobic glycolysis is also involved in the involvement of H19. Therefore, H19 may be a key gene that maintains intracellular balance under hypoxic conditions and drives adaptive cell survival under conditions of hypoxia stress.

N2  - Purpose We aimed to analyze the discordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based surrogate subtyping and PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and to assess overall survival (OS) according to discordance. Materials and Methods A total of 607 patients were analyzed. Hormone receptor (HR) expression was evaluated by IHC, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression was analyzed by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization. PAM50 intrinsic subtypes were determined according to 50 cancer genes using the NanoString nCounter Analysis System. We matched concordant tumor as luminal A and HR+/HER2-, luminal B and HR+/HER2+, HR-/HER2+ and HER2-enriched, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and normal- or basal-like. We used Ion Ampliseq Cancer Panel v2 was used to identify the genomic alteration related with discordance. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS. Results In total, 233 patients (38.4%) were discordant between IHC-based subtype and PAM50 intrinsic subtype. Using targeted sequencing, we detected somatic mutation-related discordant breast cancer including the VHL gene in the HR+/HER2- group (31% in concordant group, 0% in discordant group, p=0.03) and the IDH and RET genes (7% vs. 12%, p=0.02 and 0% vs. 25%, p=0.02, respectively) in the TNBC group. Among the luminal A/B patients with a discordant result had significantly worse OS (median OS, 73.6 months vs. not reached; p < 0.001), and among the patients with HR positivity, the basal-like group as determined by PAM50 showed significantly inferior OS compared to other intrinsic subtypes (5-year OS rate, 92.2% vs. 75.6%; p=0.01). Conclusion A substantial portion of patients showed discrepancy between IHC subtype and PAM50 intrinsic subtype in our study. The survival analysis demonstrated that current IHC-based classification could mislead the treatment and result in poor outcome. Current guidelines for IHC might be updated accordingly.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder, characterised by hypervascularised tumour formation in multiple organ systems. Vision loss associated with retinal capillary hemangioblastomas remains one of the earliest complications of VHL disease. The mortality of Vhl<sup>-/-</sup> mice in utero restricted modelling of VHL disease in this mammalian model. Zebrafish harbouring a recessive germline mutation in the vhl gene represent a viable, alternative vertebrate model to investigate associated ocular loss-of-function phenotypes. Previous studies reported neovascularisation of the brain, eye and trunk together with oedema in the vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish eye. In this study, we demonstrate vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish almost entirely lack visual function. Furthermore, hyaloid vasculature networks in the vhl<sup>-/-</sup> eye are improperly formed and this phenotype is concomitant with development of an ectopic intraretinal vasculature. Sunitinib malate, a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, market authorised for cancer, reversed the ocular behavioural and morphological phenotypes observed in vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish. We conclude that the zebrafish vhl gene contributes to an endogenous molecular barrier that prevents development of intraretinal vasculature, and that pharmacological intervention with sunitinib can improve visual function and hyaloid vessel patterning while reducing abnormally formed ectopic intraretinal vessels in vhl<sup>-/-</sup> zebrafish.

N2  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the designation of the diverse and highly aggressive breast cancers that lack the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2. Due to the lack of recognized molecular targets for therapy, chemotherapy remains the primary established treatment for TNBC. In TNBC, numerous exogenous and intrinsic factors cause accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to disrupt cellular proteostasis in a condition termed ER stress. As an adaptation, cells activate a network of pathways, the unfolded protein response (UPR), to manage ER stress. Chronic stress, a risk factor in cancer initiation and progression, keeps the UPR engaged while its apoptotic function gets gradually attenuated. The UPR has been increasingly recognized to have crucial roles both in physiological contexts and tumor pathology. In this review, we summarize the factors that may contribute to the regulation of the UPR in TNBC and its impact on various aspects of tumor biology. In addition, we review recent progress on the pharmacological targeting of the UPR, which holds therapeutic potential for TNBC intervention. Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - The concept of cancer hallmarks is considered a major generalization of the principles of cancer biology. Many refinements of this concept were proposed based on the novel findings regarding the molecular and cellular features of cancer cells elucidated since 2000. Furthermore, in the last decade the rapid development of high-throughput omics technologies provided unprecedented insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cell populations. Here, we proposed an extension of the cancer hallmarks concept based on the recent refinements of our understating of evolutionary mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) control transcriptional responses to reduced O<sub>2</sub> availability. HIFs are heterodimeric proteins composed of an O<sub>2</sub>-regulated HIF-alpha subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1beta subunit. HIF-alpha subunits are subject to prolyl hydroxylation, which targets the proteins for degradation under normoxic conditions. Small molecule prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which stabilize the HIF-alpha subunits and increase HIF-dependent expression of erythropoietin, are in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. HIFs contribute to the pathogenesis of many cancers, particularly the clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma in which loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor blocks HIF-2alpha degradation. A small molecule inhibitor that binds to HIF-2alpha and blocks dimerization with HIF-1beta is in clinical trials for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Targeting HIFs for stabilization or inhibition may improve outcomes in diseases that are common causes of mortality in the US population.

N2  - Cases with pituitary adenoma comprise 10-25% of intracranial neoplasm, being the third most common intracranial tumor, most of the adenomas are considered to be benign. About 35% of pituitary adenomas are invasive. This review summarized the known molecular basis of the invasiveness of pituitary adenomas. The study pointed out that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, pituitary tumor transforming gene, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, mainly MMP-2, and MMP-9) are core molecules responsible for the invasiveness of pituitary adenomas. The reason is that these molecules have the ability to directly or indirectly induce cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, degradation, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. HIF-1alpha induced by hypoxia or apoplexy inside the adenoma might be the initiating factor of invasive transformation, followed with angiogenesis for overexpressed VEGF, EMT for overexpressed PTTG, degradation of ECM for overexpressed MMPs, creating a suitable microenvironment within the tumor. Together, they form a complex interactive network. More investigations are required to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the invasiveness of pituitary adenomas.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common renal cell carcinoma subtype, and metastatic ccRCC is associated with 5-year survival rates of 10% to 20%. Genetically, ccRCC originates from sequential losses of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Remarkably, chromosome 3p loss occurs in more than 90% of sporadic ccRCCs. This results in concurrent one-copy loss of four tumor suppressor genes that are also mutated individually at high frequency in ccRCC (ie, VHL, 80%; PBRM1, 29% to 46%; BAP1, 6% to 19%; and SETD2, 8% to 30%). Pathogenically, 3p loss probably represents the first genetic event that occurs in sporadic ccRCC and the second genetic event in VHL-mutated hereditary ccRCC. VHL constitutes the substrate recognition module of the VCB-Cul2 E3 ligase that degrades HIF1/2a, whereas PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2 are epigenetic modulators that regulate gene transcription. Because 3p loss and VHL inactivation are nearly universal truncal events in ccRCC, the resulting HIF1/2 signaling overdrive and accompanied tumor hyper-vascularization probably underlie the therapeutic benefits observed with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, bevacizumab, cabo-zantinib, and lenvatinib. Furthermore, recent marked advances in ccRCC genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, molecular mechanisms, mouse models, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and clinical trials have rendered invaluable translational insights concerning precision kidney cancer therapeutics. With an armamentarium encompassing 13 drugs that exploit seven unique therapeutic mechanisms (ie, cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, mTORC1, cMET/AXL, fibroblast growth factor receptor, programmed cell death-1 and programmed death-ligand 1, and cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte associated-4) to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma, one of the imminent clinical questions concerning care of patients with metastatic ccRCC is how a personalized treatment strategy, through rationally combining and sequencing different therapeutic modalities, can be formulated to offer the best clinical outcome for individual patients. Here, we attempt to integrate recent discoveries of immediate translational impacts and discuss future translational challenges and opportunities.

N2  - p-Cresyl sulfate (pCS), a uremic toxin, can cause renal damage and dysfunction. Studies suggest that renal dysfunction increases the prevalence of renal cancer. However, the effect of pCS on the proliferation and migration of renal cancer is unclear. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) expresses mutant von Hippel-Lindau gene and is difficult to treat. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and 2-alpha (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha) as well as microRNA-21 (miR-21) can regulate the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells. However, the association between HIF-alpha and miR-21 in ccRCC remains unclear. Therefore, the effects of pCS on ccRCC cells were investigated for HIF-alpha and miR-21 signals. Our results showed that pCS induced overexpression of HIF-1alpha and promoted the proliferation and regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins, including E-cadherin, fibronectin, twist and vimentin in ccRCC cells. pCS treatment increased miR-21 expression. Specifically, inhibition of miR-21 blocked pCS-induced proliferation and migration. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that pCS directly induced the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells through mechanisms involving miR-21/HIF-1alpha signaling pathways.

N2  - Introduction Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a complex disorder, in which increased oxygen demand of tissues results in a complex setting of neoplastic disorders: i.e. clear cell renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hemangiomas, Lindau tumor, etc., usually appearing well before the age of forty, and usually without polyglobulia. The background of this disease are a series of mutation in VHL gene. This is positioned on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26). There are over 1500 germline mutations and somatic mutations found or identified in VHL disease. Some rare cases of mutated VHL gene might induce isolated polycythemia, interestingly these cases the other tumors are missing: so it is recommended to check VHL gene in polycythemia if aetiology otherwise not explained. Much less is known about non classical VHL mutations, but just simple VHL polymorphism issues (usually considered innocent, no clinical significance). Wen-Chu Wang et al. BMC Res Notes, 7:628, 2014, VHL polymorphism: Not at all are innocents, at least two single nucleotide polymorphisms of them are not insignificant on clinical grounds. For example Rs779805 polymorphism associates clear renal cell cancer in Taiwan and Mainland China more frequently, but, much less in caucasian population. Somewhat more prostatic and large bowel cancer have been found in this polymorphism, as well. VHL polymorphism Rs1642742: similar disorder association and geographic distribution. However, no blood count abnormalities mentioned in these Chinese reports. Patients and Methods We referred some patient samples gained from eastern Hungary (roughly 2 Million population) with polycythemia like syndrome without Jak2 V617F or exon 12 mutations, no mpl W515 mutation, with low or normal erythropoietin and O2 saturation values (during the past 4 years). We eagerly screened VHL gene in the patients especially if they were young (under 30) or there was evidence of familiar polyglobulia pattern or more cancer. VHL sequenations were performed: VHL gene coding regions: We performed the PCR amplification of intron (IVS1-195-nt) before 1st exon sequences PCR amplification, followed by direct fluorescent sequenation. This work had been performed by Zsuzsanna Bereczky, University Laboratory Medicine institute, her work is kindly acknowledged and highly appreciated Results 1. We have found, even to our surprise,13 patients or probands with the same VHL homo or heterozygous VHL polymorphism, namely the intron (IVS1-195-nt) before the 1st exon: i.e. rs779805 G>A, similar to what had been described in chinese population without blood count abnormalities (but associations with solid tumours) 2. None of the samples so far sequenced revealed true, classical VHL gene mutation. 3. We have found additional cancers in five families: clear renal cell cancer (1), large bowel cancer (2) , melanoma (1) in the same family. more sporadic large bowel cancers, a single Hodgkin lymphoma, bony tumour, gynecological cancers (might or might not be coincidental). There were some patients (during family exploration) who had hemoglobin level over 190 g/L under the age of twenty. 4. Clinical features: Most patients were unusually young. High hemoglobin/red cell count was isolated in most instances, normal white blood cell or platelet counts. Aquagenic pruritus was usually absent, two cases had very mild, atypical itching. Spleen sizes were normal in all cases. In respect of transformation the two-four years observational period is irrelevantly short. Bone marrow examinations were performed in some cases, with normal description and analysis results. We used cautious phlebotomies, targeting 0,52 hematocrit levels. All of them were advised smoking cessation. We performed ultrasound and simple cancer screening on a yearly basis, which we do recommend further on. 5. by chance we identified one young polycythemia patients with same polymorphism and in addition Jak2 V617F mutated status. Conclusion(s): we do recommend VHL gene sequenation in young patients with otherwise unxplained polyglobulia, especially if there is any sign of familiarity, or unusual precipitation of cancer in the family. We are extending our family screening more deeply, and try to gain data on this polymorphism in 100 young healthy volunteers, analysing their bloofd counts and complex family history. We plan careful hematologic and oncologic followup of our patients and first degree relatives.

N2  - Both Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) and Never-in-mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinase 1 (NEK1) are involved in primary cilium formation, but whether VHL could regulate NEK1 is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that renal cancer cells Caki-1 and ACHN with wild-type VHL expressed lower level of NEK1 than that of VHL-defective cells including 786-O, 769-P and A498cells. VHL-overexpression down-regulated NEK1 in 769-P cells, while VHL-knockdown up-regulated NEK1 in Caki-1cells. In addition, we found the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the promoter sequence of NEK1 and hypoxia induced NEK1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. HIF-2alpha knockdown blocked hypoxia induced NEK1 upregulation instead of HIF-1alpha, which indicates that NEK1 may be a new target of HIF-2alpha. Moreover, we confirmed the association between VHL and NEK1 in Caki-1cell, then showed VHL promoted NEK1 protein degradation and ubiquitination. In conclusion, our findings showed VHL regulates NEK1 via both HIF-2alpha pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in renal cancer cells.

N2  - Hemangioblastomas are rare vascularized central nervous system tumors, which can occur sporadically or be associated with von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. The pathogenesis of hemangioblastomas in von Hippel Lindau Syndrome is proposed to involve a pseudohypoxic intracellular state induced by dysregulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha due to the absence of von Hippel Lindau protein complex mediated destruction. Dysregulation of fumarate hydratase, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, occurs in Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome due to germline fumarate hydratase gene mutations, and also results in oncogenesis via hypoxia inducible factor alpha dysregulation. We present a case study of hemangioblastoma occurrence in a Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome patient and propose it as possible evidence of a phenotypic overlap between von Hippel Lindau and Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndromes due to their overlapping role in the biochemical regulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha.

N2  - Renal cancer is the major cause of mortality due to abnormal functioning of von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) and Jade Family PHD Finger 1 (JADE1) complex. E3 ubiquitin ligase JADE1 is stabilized by pVHL interaction through its plant homeodomains (PHDs). JADE1 acts as a renal tumor suppressor that promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of beta-catenin by inhibiting canonical WNT signalling. Current study focuses on the structural characterization of reported missense mutations in pVHL through in silico approaches. The predicted 3-dimensional structures of pVHL<sup>WT</sup>, pVHL<sup>Y98H</sup>, pVHL<sup>Y112H</sup>, pVHL<sup>L118P</sup> and pVHL<sup>R167W</sup> were subjected to binding analysis against JADE1 through molecular docking and simulation assays. In all cases, JADE1 binding was observed at the beta-domain, except pVHL<sup>L118P</sup> that exhibited binding with JADE1 through its alpha-domain. Our results signify that JADE1 stabilization is induced by pVHL alpha-domain, while beta-domain is required for JADE1 binding. pVHL binding was mediated through beta1 and beta2-strands against the concave surface of the JADE1-PHD domain. The pVHL-JADE1 complex was evaluated to scrutinize the beta-catenin-binding interface, which suggested the contribution of both alpha and beta-domains of pVHL in beta-catenin binding. The eleven-residue (Tyr30-Thr40) beta-catenin segment exhibited association in a bipartite manner with pVHL-JADE1 complex. The presented model depicts a pVHL-JADE1 interface for the cooperative regulation of beta-catenin binding. We propose that reduced JADE1 stabilization in case of pVHL<sup>L118P</sup> and pVHL<sup>R167W</sup> may correlate with the increased activity of beta-catenin that may lead to renal cancer through beta-catenin de-repression. Overall, beta-catenin targeting mechanism coupled with the structural knowledge of JADE1-pVHL complex will provide better understanding of renal cancer pathogenesis.

N2  - Chromaffin tumors, e.g. pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are caused by germline mutations of several susceptibility genes in 30-40% of the patients. The corresponding syndromes are multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2, RET gene), von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), paraganglioma syndrome types 1-5 (PGL1-5, SDHx gene) and familial pheochromocytoma due to mutations in the MAX and TMEM127 genes. Clinically, screening for such diseases should be carried out by clinical symptoms and mutation analyses. Important indications can be found in the history of patients and their families, young age of manifestation (<30 years), extra-adrenal localization and the presence of metastatic pheochromocytomas. Organ-preserving endoscopic adrenal operations are nowadays standard for hereditary pheochromocytomas. Previous studies have shown that the reoccurrence of tumors in residual tissue is rare and can occur many years later and that metastatic tumors arising from such recurrences are very rare. When a mutation is detected in a susceptibility gene, a multidisciplinary follow-up care tailored to each individual syndrome is essential.

N1  - Guilmette, Julie MNose, Vania Veronica: review
N2  - This review focuses on discussing the main modifications of the recently published 2017 WHO Classification of Neoplasms of the Neuroendocrine Pancreas (panNEN). Recent updates separate pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors into 2 broad categories: well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNET) and poorly differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (panNEC), and incorporates a new subcategory of "well-differentiated high-grade NET (G3)" to the well-differentiated NET category. This new classification algorithm aims to improve the prediction of clinical outcomes and survival and help clinicians select better therapeutic strategies for patient care and management. In addition, these neuroendocrine neoplasms are capable of producing large quantity of hormones leading to clinical hormone hypersecretion syndromes. These functioning tumors include, insulinomas, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, gastrinomas, VIPomas, serotonin-producing tumors, and ACTH-producing tumors. Although most panNENs arise as sporadic diseases, a subset of these heterogeneous tumors present as parts on inherited genetic syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis, and glucagon cell hyperplasia and neoplasia syndromes. Characteristic clinical and morphologic findings for certain functioning and syndromic panNENs should alert both pathologists and clinicians as appropriate patient management and possible genetic counseling may be necessary.

N2  - Most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) have inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), resulting in the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha-subunits (HIF-alpha) and their downstream targets. HIF-2alpha expression is particularly high in ccRCC and is associated with increased ccRCC growth and aggressiveness. In the canonical HIF signaling pathway, HIF-prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) suppresses HIF-2alpha protein by post-translational hydroxylation under sufficient oxygen availability. Here, using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR, and siRNA-mediated gene silencing, we show that unlike in the canonical pathway, PHD3 silencing in ccRCC cells leads to down-regulation of HIF-2alpha protein and mRNA. Depletion of other PHD family members had no effect on HIF-2alpha expression, and PHD3 knockdown in non-RCC cells resulted in the expected increase in HIF-2alpha protein expression. Accordingly, PHD3 knockdown decreased HIF-2alpha target gene expression in ccRCC cells and expression was restored upon forced HIF-2alpha expression. The effect of PHD3 depletion was pinpointed to HIF2A mRNA stability. In line with these in vitro results, a strong positive correlation of PHD3 and HIF2A mRNA expression in ccRCC tumors was detected. Our results suggest that in contrast to the known negative regulation of HIF-2alpha in most cell types, high PHD3 expression in ccRCC cells maintains elevated HIF-2alpha expression and that of its target genes, which may enhance kidney cancer aggressiveness.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the major cause of death among patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Resistance to therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis opens the question about the underlying mechanisms. Previously we have described that RWDD3 or RSUME (RWD domain-containing protein SUMO Enhancer) sumoylates and binds VHL protein and negatively regulates HIF degradation, leading to xenograft RCC tumor growth in mice. In this study, we performed a bioinformatics analysis in a ccRCC dataset showing an association of RSUME levels with VHL mutations and tumor progression, and we demonstrate the molecular mechanism by which RSUME regulates the pathologic angiogenic phenotype of VHL missense mutations. We report that VHL mutants fail to downregulate RSUME protein levels accounting for the increased RSUME expression found in RCC tumors. Furthermore, we prove that targeting RSUME in RCC cell line clones carrying missense VHL mutants results in decreased early tumor angiogenesis. The mechanism we describe is that RSUME sumoylates VHL mutants and beyond its sumoylation capacity, interacts with Type 2 VHL mutants, reduces HIF-2alpha-VHL mutants binding, and negatively regulates the assembly of the Type 2 VHL, Elongins and Cullins (ECV) complex. Altogether these results show RSUME involvement in VHL mutants deregulation that leads to the angiogenic phenotype of RCC tumors.

Veronica: no novel patient study
N2  - BACKGROUND: Historically, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the main causes of death in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. However, the natural history of VHL-related RCC has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. This report described the natural history of VHL-related RCC in a large Chinese VHL cohort and might be helpful in the surveillance and treatment of VHL disease. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included 196 renal tumours from 150 patients with VHL disease. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the influence of age of onset, sex, family history, unilateral or bilateral tumour, VHL disease type, mutation type, mutation location, and tumour size on tumour growth, metastasis and survival in patients with VHL disease. RESULTS: The mean age of onset was 38.8 years, and the mean initial tumour size was 3.1 cm. The mean linear growth rate was 0.49 cm/year. Patients experienced faster tumour growth when they had later age of onset, larger initial tumour size, missense mutation, mutations locating in exon 3, and when they were not affected by cerebral or retinal haemangioblastomas. Tumours larger than 4 cm grew faster than those smaller than 4 cm. Bilateral tumours, large initial tumours, fast tumour growth and metastasis were risk factors for poor prognosis in VHL-related RCC. CONCLUSION: This large study demonstrated that age of onset, initial tumour size, concomitant tumours, mutation type and mutation location had an effect on growth rate in VHL-related RCC. Active surveillance may be safe for patients with tumour size less than 4 cm, which is helpful in clinical decision-making.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a monogenic disorder characterized by the development of tumors affecting the central nervous system, kidney, pancreas, or adrenal glands, and due to germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. About 5% of patients with a typical VHL phenotype have no mutation detected by conventional techniques, so a postzygotic VHL mosaicism can be suspected. The aim of this study was therefore to implement a next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategy for VHL mosaic mutation detection, including an optimization of the original Personal Genome Machine design by enrichment with oligonucleotides corresponding to amplicons with insufficient depth of coverage. Two complementary strategies were developed for the confirmation of mosaic mutations identified by NGS, SNaPshot for variants present at an allelic ratio greater than 5%, and droplet digital PCR for allelic ratio above 1%. VHL mutant plasmids were generated to assess VHL mosaic mutation detection in different exons and to set up an internal quality control that could be included in each run or regularly to validate the assay. This strategy was applied to 47 patients with a suggestive or clinical VHL disease, and mosaic mutations were identified in 8.5% of patients. In conclusion, NGS technologies combined with SNaPshot or droplet digital PCR allow the detection and confirmation of mosaic mutations in a clinical laboratory setting.

N2  - Aims: The purpose of the present research is to investigate the effects of the VHL protein antagonist, VH298, on functional activities of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells and the effects on the wound healing process in a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemic rat model. Methods: HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha protein levels in VH298-treated rat fibroblasts (rFb) were measured by immunoblotting, rFb proliferation was detected by the CCK-8 assay, and mRNA levels of related genes were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. In vitro wound healing was simulated by the scratch test; angiogenesis was measured by the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (hUVEC) tube formation assay. VH298 or PBS was locally injected into wounds in rat models with streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced hyperglycaemia, the wound tissues were harvested, and haematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson trichrome staining and immunohistochemical processes were conducted. Results: HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha levels increased in VH298-treated rFb, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Thirty micromolar VH298 could significantly increase cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and gene expression of type I collagen-alpha1 (Col1-alpha1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The VH298-treated wound had a better healing pattern, activation of HIF-1 signalling, and vascularization. Conclusions: Taken together, VH298 activated the HIF-1 signalling pathway by stabilizing both HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha. VH298 enhanced rFb functions, promoted hUVEC angiogenesis, and accelerated wound healing in the rat model mimicking diabetes mellitus.

N2  - There is no standard treatment for metastatic chromophobe renal cell cancer (chRCC). Analysis of chRCC samples in this study yielded information about important genetic aberrations. This information can be used formulate newer therapeutic approaches and to design future clinical trials in chRCC. Metastatic chromophobe renal cell cancer (chRCC) is a rare subtype of RCC with no standard treatment. We performed molecular profiling of 12 chRCC cases to identify alterations predictive of response to therapy. Tests included immunohistochemistry assays, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and next-generation sequencing. Analysis identified c-KIT overexpression in 6/9 (67%) samples analyzed, and loss of protein expression of RRM1 and MGMT in 11/12 (92%) and of PTEN in 7/12 samples (58%). Mutations of TP53, PTEN, APC, and VHL genes were identified. In summary, molecular profiling of chRCC identified alterations in genes and protein expression that might provide a mechanistic rationale for off-label use of approved therapies in advanced chRCC, and could guide the design of molecularly targeted clinical trials. Patient Summary: In this study, we evaluated samples of a rare type of kidney cancer (chromophobe type) and identified potential genetic markers that could be used to individualize treatment and possibly improve treatment outcomes.

N2  - Familiar cancers represent a privileged point of view for studying the complex cellular events inducing tumor transformation. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a familiar predisposition to develop cancer is a clear example. Here, we present our efforts to decipher the role of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) in cancer insurgence. We collected high quality information about both pVHL mutations and interactors to investigate the association between patient phenotypes, mutated protein surface and impaired interactions. Our data suggest that different phenotypes correlate with localized perturbations of the pVHL structure, with specific cell functions associated to different protein surfaces. We propose five different pVHL interfaces to be selectively involved in modulating proteins regulating gene expression, protein homeostasis as well as to address extracellular matrix (ECM) and ciliogenesis associated functions. These data were used to drive molecular docking of pVHL with its interactors and guide Petri net simulations of the most promising alterations. We predict that disruption of pVHL association with certain interactors can trigger tumor transformation, inducing metabolism imbalance and ECM remodeling. Collectively taken, our findings provide novel insights into VHL-associated tumorigenesis. This highly integrated in silico approach may help elucidate novel treatment paradigms for VHL disease.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and particularly its clear cell histological subtype, is commonly characterized by genetic alterations in the Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, leading to a typically exasperated angiogenesis. However, other biological and genetic peculiarities contribute to differentiate this malignancy from other solid tumors, including its immunogenicity. Areas covered: This review focuses on the present and future role of antiangiogenic drugs, administered either alone (as it has been in the past few years), or in combination with other agents (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors), in the treatment of metastatic RCC. Expert commentary: Due to its peculiar pathogenesis, it is unrealistic to expect to be able to get rid of antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of this disease; however, we do expect that combinations of VEGF/VEGFRs-targeting agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors will gradually replace antiangiogenic monotherapies as the standard of care, at least in the first line setting of metastatic RCC patients. Biomarkers discovery remains the highest priority in order to further improve the percentage of patients benefitting of our treatment.

N2  - Hypoxia is a condition always present in tumor environment owing to the fast growth of tumor cells not supported by adequate blood supply. There is increasing evidence that hypoxia plays an important role in cancer dormancy and cancer metabolism, increasing stemness activity and bringing about cancer initiation and progression. This condition may influence the production of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) a helix transcription factor which is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor growth through the regulation of genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolytic metabolism and other biological mechanisms. In normoxia condition HIF is inactivated by prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (EGLN 1-3, also known as PHD 1-3) using oxygen as a substrate. Once hydroxilated it binds to a protein called Von Hippel Lindau protein (VHL) for its degradation, whereas in hypoxia condition stabilization and nuclear translocation occur, leading to oncogenes activation. It has got three isoforms HIF-1 HIF-2 and HIF-3. The most studied factor is HIF-1 which is a heterodimer consisting of two forms, the form alpha is expressed in manner oxygen dependent, the form beta is expressed constitutively. Its presence in tumor microenvironment could foster among other the expression of VEGF, HGF, Met protoncogene which induces degradation of the extracellular matrix and TWIST gene, which is in turn involved in a mechanism of cancer cell metastasis called epithelial-mesenchimal transition(EMT). In this review, we summarize the most important findings in HIF action in different types of cancer focusing on its properties to induce tumor cell growth and highlighting its poor prognostic value in different cancers sites.

N2  - CONTEXT: von Hippel-Lindau disease, comprising renal cancer, hemangioblastoma and/or pheochromocytoma (PHEO) is caused by missense or truncating variants of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, which is involved in degradation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). However, the role of synonymous VHL variants in the disease is unclear. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated a synonymous VHL variant in patients with familial PHEO or VHL disease without a detectable pathogenic VHL mutation. DESIGN: We performed genetic and transcriptional analyses of leukocytes and/or tumors from affected and unaffected individuals and evaluated VHL splicing in existing cancer databases. RESULTS: We identified a synonymous VHL variant(c.414A>G, p.Pro138Pro) as the driver event in five independent individuals/families with PHEOs or VHL syndrome. This variant promotes exon 2 skipping and, hence, abolishes expression of the full-length VHL transcript. Exon 2 spans the HIF binding domain, required for HIF degradation by VHL. Accordingly, PHEOs carrying this variant display HIF hyperactivation typical of VHL loss. Moreover, other exon 2 VHL variants from the TCGA pan-cancer datasets are biased toward expression of a VHL transcript that excludes this exon, supporting a broader impact of this spliced variant. CONCLUSION: A recurrent synonymous VHL variant (c.414A>G, p.Pro138Pro) confers susceptibility to PHEO and VHL disease through splice disruption, leading to VHL dysfunction. This finding indicates that certain synonymous VHL variants may be clinically relevant and should be considered in genetic testing and surveillance settings. The observation that other coding VHL variants can exclude exon 2 suggests that dysregulated splicing may be an underappreciated mechanism in VHL-mediated tumorigenesis.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by various endocrine, nonendocrine, benign, and malignant tumors in various organs. VHL tumor suppressor gene, located on short arm of chromosome 3 is responsible for this. Pheochromocytoma (PCC) is one of the important endocrine manifestations that needs to be ruled out in case of VHL suspicion. In this review, we summarize the endocrine manifestations of VHL disease and their management while giving case history of five such cases.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is rare neurocutaneous disorder arising from an inactivating mutation of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p35. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and predominantly involves tissues originating from the ectodermal germ layer. Although hemangioblastomas of retina and cerebellum are the most common clinical features, multiple-organ involvement in the form of renal cell carcinomas, spinal hemangioblastomas, renal cysts, pancreatic cysts have also been reported. Hemangioblastomas of the spinal canal could present as cauda equina syndrome. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the case of a 55-year-old man with cauda equina syndrome as his first manifestion. An initial magnetic resonance imaging scan uncovered hemangiomas in the spinal canal. A thorough family history strongly suggested an autosomal dominant pattern of disease inheritance. Further physical examination and imaging revealed additional organ involvement consistent with VHL. We performed laminectomy and partial resection of hemangioblastoma for decompression. He recovered satisfactorily with his cauda equina syndrome resolving quickly post operation. No deterioration was apparent by 12 months follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with cauda equina syndrome as the first manifestation of VHL disease. Laminectomy and partial resection of hemangioblastoma is a safe and effective treatment to resolve impingement of the spinal cord. VHL disease resulting in hemangioblastoma in the spinal canal is rarely seen but should be included in the differential diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome to facilitate genetic counseling for the proband and offspring.

Veronica: no novel patient study
N2  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a radiomics model with all-relevant imaging features from multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC and to investigate the possible radiogenomics link between the imaging features and a key ccRCC driver gene-the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutation. METHODS: In this retrospective two-center study, two radiomics models were built using random forest from a training cohort (170 patients), where one model was built with all-relevant features and the other with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) features. A model combining all-relevant features and clinical factors (sex, age) was also built. The radiogenomics association between selected features and VHL mutation was investigated by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All models were tested on an independent validation cohort (85 patients) with ROC curves analysis. RESULTS: The model with eight all-relevant features from corticomedullary phase CT achieved an AUC of 0.949 and an accuracy of 92.9% in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed the model with eight mRMR features (seven from nephrographic phase and one from corticomedullary phase) with an AUC of 0.851 and an accuracy of 81.2%. Combining age and sex did not benefit the performance. Five out of eight all-relevant features were significantly associated with VHL mutation, while all eight mRMR features were significantly associated with VHL mutation (false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC. Most subtype-discriminative imaging features were found to be significantly associated with VHL mutation, which may underlie the molecular basis of the radiomics features. KEY POINTS: * All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC with high accuracy. * Most RCC-subtype-discriminative CT features were associated with the key RCC-driven gene-the VHL gene mutation. * Radiomics model can be more accurate and interpretable when the imaging features could reflect underlying molecular basis of RCC.

N2  - The abundant and reversible N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification and its modulators have important roles in regulating various gene expression and biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that fat mass and obesity associated (FTO), as an m6A demethylase, plays a critical anti-tumorigenic role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). FTO is suppressed in ccRCC tissue. The low expression of FTO in human ccRCC correlates with increased tumour severity and poor patient survival. The Von Hippel-Lindau-deficient cells expressing FTO restores mitochondrial activity, induces oxidative stress and ROS production and shows impaired tumour growth, through increasing expression of PGC-1alpha by reducing m6A levels in its mRNA transcripts. Our work demonstrates the functional importance of the m6A methylation and its modulator, and uncovers a critical FTO-PGC-1alpha axis for developing effective therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ccRCC.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene and is accompanied by the development of both benign and malignant tumors. Clarithromycin (CAM) is a widely used anti-inflammatory drug that has also been proven effective for treating some cancers. In this study, we present a novel case of a 38-year-old female patient with VHL syndrome confirmed by computed tomography, with no relevant family history. The patient was only offered close follow-up observation after diagnosis, but was orally administered CAM twice daily when her disease progressed. After treatment for 3 months, her inner ear tumors had stopped growing and her kidney cysts had shrunk. Her pancreatic tumors treated with CAM showed no significant increase in size, and the lymph node swelling disappeared. CAM treatment was interrupted for 2 years and then stopped for 5 years when improvements were noted; the patient's condition thereafter gradually improved and finally stabilized with no obvious side effects. We discuss this case in the context of the published literature and consider the possible mechanisms of CAM action in the treatment of VHL syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with VHL syndrome treated with CAM.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence demonstrated that restoration of wild type VHL in human renal cancer cells decreased in vitro NK susceptibility. To investigate on the role of tumoral VHL status versus NK capability in renal cancer patients, 51 RCC patients were characterized for VHL mutational status and NK function. METHODS: VHL mutational status was determined by direct DNA sequencing on tumor tissue. NK cytotoxicity was measured against specific target cells K562, VHL-wild type (CAKI-1) and VHL-mutated (A498) human renal cancer cells through externalization of CD107a and IFN-gamma production. Activating NK receptors, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2D, DNAM-1, NCAM-1 and FcgammaRIIIa were evaluated through quantitative RT-PCR. RCC tumoral Tregs were characterized as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> and Treg function was evaluated as inhibition of T-effector proliferation. RESULTS: VHL mutations were detected in 26/55 (47%) RCC patients. IL-2 activated whole-blood samples (28 VHL-WT-RCC and 23 VHL-MUT-RCC) were evaluated for NK cytotoxicity toward human renal cancer cells A498, VHL-MUT and CAKI-1, VHL-WT. Efficient NK degranulation and increase in IFN-gamma production was detected when IL-2 activated whole-blood from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were tested toward A498 as compared to CAKI-1 cells (CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 7 +/- 2% vs 1 +/- 0.41%, p = 0.015; IFN-gamma<sup>+</sup>NK: 6.26 +/- 3.4% vs 1.78 +/- 0.9% respectively). In addition, IL-2 activated NKs induced higher CD107a exposure in the presence of RCC autologous tumor cells or A498 as compared to SN12C (average CD107a<sup>+</sup>NK: 4.7 and 2.7% vs 0.3% respectively at 10E:1 T ratio). VHL-MUT-RCC tumors were NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells infiltrated and expressed high NKp30 and NKp46 receptors as compared to VHL-WT-RCC tumors. A significant lower number of Tregs was detected in the tumor microenvironment of 13 VHL-MUT-RCC as compared to 13 VHL-WT-RCC tumors (1.84 +/- 0.36% vs 3.79 +/- 0.74% respectively, p = 0.04). Tregs isolated from VHL-MUT-RCC patients were less suppressive of patients T effector proliferation compared to Tregs from VHL-WT-RCC patients (Teff proliferation: 6.7 +/- 3.9% vs 2.8 +/- 1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: VHL tumoral mutations improve NKs effectiveness in RCC patients and need to be considered in the evaluation of immune response. Moreover therapeutic strategies designed to target NK cells could be beneficial in VHL-mutated-RCCs alone or in association with immune checkpoints inhibitors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Every year more than 800 patients in Denmark are diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) of which 3-5% are expected to be part of a hereditary renal cancer syndrome. We performed genetic screening of causative and putative RCC-genes (VHL, FH, FLCN, MET, SDHB, BAP1, MITF, CDKN2B) in RCC-patients suspected of a genetic predisposition. METHODS: The cohort consisted of forty-eight Danish families or individuals with early onset RCC, a family history of RCC, a family history of RCC and melanoma or both RCC- and melanoma diagnosis in the same individual. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples or cancer-free formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. RESULTS: One start codon variant of unknown clinical significance (VUS) (c.3G>A, p.Met1Ile) and one missense VUS (c.631A>C, p.Met211Leu) was found in VHL in a patient with RCC-onset at twenty-eight years of age but without other manifestations or family history of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL). Furthermore, in three families we found three different variants in BAP1, one of which was a novel non-segregating missense variant (c.1502G>A, p.Ser501Asn) in a family with two brothers affected with RCC. Finally, we found the known E318K-substitution in MITF in a RCC-affected member of a family with multiple melanomas. No variants were detected in CDKN2B. CONCLUSION: Although we did find three VUS's in BAP1 in three families and a pathogenic variant in MITF in one family, pathogenic germline variants in BAP1, MITF or CDKN2B are not frequent causes of hereditary renal cancer in Denmark. It is possible that the high prevalence of risk factors such as male gender, smoking and obesity has influenced the development of cancer in the patients of the current study. Further investigations into putative predisposing genes and risk factors of RCC are necessary to enable better prediction of renal cancer risk or presymptomatic testing of relatives in hereditary renal cancer families.

N2  - <b>Background:</b> Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors are well known to control the transcriptional response to hypoxia. Given the importance of cellular response to hypoxia, a number of pharmacological agents to interfere with this pathway have been developed and entered pre-clinical or clinical trial phases. However, how similar or divergent the transcriptional response elicited by different points of interference in cells is currently unknown. <b>Methods:</b> We performed RNA-sequencing to analyse the similarities and differences of transcriptional response in HeLa cells treated with hypoxia or chemical agents that stabilise HIF by inhibiting components of the hypoxia signalling pathway - prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor or von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) inhibitor. <b>Results:</b> This analysis revealed that hypoxia produces the highest changes in gene transcription, with activation and repression of genes being in large numbers. Treatment with the PHD inhibitor IOX2 or the VHL inhibitor VH032 led mostly to gene activation, majorly via a HIF-dependent manner. These results were also confirmed by qRT-PCR using more specific and/or efficient inhibitors, FG-4592 (PHDs) and VH298 (VHL). <b>Conclusion:</b> PHD inhibition and VHL inhibition mimic gene activation promoted by hypoxia via a HIF-dependent manner. However, gene repression is mostly associated with the hypoxia response and not common to the response elicited by inhibitors of the pathway.

N2  - Objectives: To develop a radiomics model with all-relevant imaging features from multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for differentiating clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from non-ccRCC and to investigate the possible radiogenomics link between the imaging features and a key ccRCC driver gene-the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutation. Method(s): In this retrospective two-center study, two radiomics models were built using random forest from a training cohort (170 patients), where one model was built with all-relevant features and the other with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) features. A model combining all-relevant features and clinical factors (sex, age) was also built. The radiogenomics association between selected features and VHL mutation was investigated by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. All models were tested on an independent validation cohort (85 patients) with ROC curves analysis. Result(s): The model with eight all-relevant features from corticomedullary phase CT achieved an AUC of 0.949 and an accuracy of 92.9% in the validation cohort, which significantly outperformed the model with eight mRMR features (seven from nephrographic phase and one from corticomedullary phase) with an AUC of 0.851 and an accuracy of 81.2%. Combining age and sex did not benefit the performance. Five out of eight all-relevant features were significantly associated with VHL mutation, while all eight mRMR features were significantly associated with VHL mutation (false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC. Most subtype-discriminative imaging features were found to be significantly associated with VHL mutation, which may underlie the molecular basis of the radiomics features. Key Points: * All-relevant features in corticomedullary phase CT can be used to differentiate ccRCC from non-ccRCC with high accuracy. * Most RCC-subtype-discriminative CT features were associated with the key RCC-driven gene-the VHL gene mutation. * Radiomics model can be more accurate and interpretable when the imaging features could reflect underlying molecular basis of RCC.

N2  - Purpose: Across the globe, cervical cancer is the most common female malignancy, second only to breast cancer, as in both incidence and mortality. Currently, tissue biopsy is the gold standard to verify carcinoma of uterine cervix initial diagnosis and can be challenging due to its invasive nature. In this study, our objective was a noninvasive genetic panel for timely detection of cervical carcinoma and its progression using cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA). Method(s): Twenty-five cervical carcinoma patients were tested with a 50-gene tumor panel. ctDNA isolated from serum was checked for single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) or copy number alterations using targeted next-generation sequencing, with further validation of results by checking respective formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues for the same genetic alterations. Result(s): Out of 50 genes, 32 were detected in the serum samples. The SNVs detected included TP53 in 52.3% patients, CDKN2A in 47.6%, PTEN and STK11 in 33.3% patients, BRAF and VHL in 28.5% patients, EGFR and SMAD4 in 19% patients; CTNNB1, GNAS, KIT, APC, PIK3CA in 14.28% patients; SMARCB1, SMO, RET, FBXW7, ERBB2, CSF1R, CDH1, AKT1, ATM, EBB4, FGFR3, FLT3, HRAS, JAK3, MET, NOTCH1, NPM1, KRAS, PTPN11 in 4.7 to 9.5% patients. On combining alterations in BRAF, CDKN2A, EGFR, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, TP53 and VHL genes, at least one of the genetic alterations was found in 100% patients. Conclusion(s): These findings illustrate that ctDNA is easily demonstrable and can be used as a surrogate for tissue biopsy in uterine cervix carcinoma.

N2  - Hemangioblastomas are rare vascularized central nervous system tumors, which can occur sporadically or be associated with von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. The pathogenesis of hemangioblastomas in von Hippel Lindau Syndrome is proposed to involve a pseudohypoxic intracellular state induced by dysregulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha due to the absence of von Hippel Lindau protein complex mediated destruction. Dysregulation of fumarate hydratase, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, occurs in Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome due to germline fumarate hydratase gene mutations, and also results in oncogenesis via hypoxia inducible factor alpha dysregulation. We present a case study of hemangioblastoma occurrence in a Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndrome patient and propose it as possible evidence of a phenotypic overlap between von Hippel Lindau and Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer Syndromes due to their overlapping role in the biochemical regulation of hypoxia inducible factor alpha.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common and lethal form of urological cancer diagnosed globally. Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene and the resultant overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein are considered hallmarks of ccRCC. Persistently activated HIF-1alpha is associated with increased cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), consequently leading to ccRCC progression and metastasis to other organs. However, the VHL status alone cannot predict the differential sensitivity of ccRCC to cancer treatments, which suggests that other molecular differences may contribute to the differential response of ccRCC cells to drug therapies. In this study, we investigated the response to metformin (an antidiabetic drug) of two human ccRCC cell lines Caki-1 and Caki-2, which express wild-type VHL. Our findings demonstrate a differential response between the two ccRCC cell lines studied, with Caki-2 cells being more sensitive to metformin compared to Caki-1 cells, which could be linked to the differential expression of HIF-1 despite both cell lines carrying a wild-type VHL. Our study unveils the therapeutic potential of metformin to inhibit the progression of ccRCC in vitro. Additional preclinical and clinical studies are required to ascertain the therapeutic efficacy of metformin against ccRCC.

N2  - Background: Historically, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the main causes of death in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. However, the natural history of VHL-related RCC has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. This report described the natural history of VHL-related RCC in a large Chinese VHL cohort and might be helpful in the surveillance and treatment of VHL disease. Method(s): In this retrospective study, we included 196 renal tumours from 150 patients with VHL disease. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the influence of age of onset, sex, family history, unilateral or bilateral tumour, VHL disease type, mutation type, mutation location, and tumour size on tumour growth, metastasis and survival in patients with VHL disease. Result(s): The mean age of onset was 38.8 years, and the mean initial tumour size was 3.1 cm. The mean linear growth rate was 0.49 cm/year. Patients experienced faster tumour growth when they had later age of onset, larger initial tumour size, missense mutation, mutations locating in exon 3, and when they were not affected by cerebral or retinal haemangioblastomas. Tumours larger than 4 cm grew faster than those smaller than 4 cm. Bilateral tumours, large initial tumours, fast tumour growth and metastasis were risk factors for poor prognosis in VHL-related RCC. Conclusion(s): This large study demonstrated that age of onset, initial tumour size, concomitant tumours, mutation type and mutation location had an effect on growth rate in VHL-related RCC. Active surveillance may be safe for patients with tumour size less than 4 cm, which is helpful in clinical decision-making. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a genetic syndrome that involves the development of tumors in numerous organs. The kidney is one of the most frequently affected organs, and patients with VHL and renal tumors require repeated nephrectomy. The present study aimed to further determine the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which may allow more rational clinical treatment decisions. This study included 27 patients with VHL who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy at the Peking University First Hospital between January 2010 and April 2018. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. The expression of RCC-associated molecular markers was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The mean size of the renal tumors was 4.3+/-2.0 cm (range 1.3-9.5 cm). The pathological type in 26 cases (96.3%) was clear cell RCC (CCRCC), whereas only one patient was diagnosed with CCRCC and clear cell papillary RCC. Renal cysts with a clear cell lining were observed, and RCC cell clusters were scattered in renal cyst cavities. Among the 27 patients, 21 (77.8%) were diagnosed with stage IA/T1N0M0, according to Tumor-Node-Metastasis staging, and 16 (59.3%) had grade 1 tumors. The mean postoperative follow-up duration was 39.0+/-24.0 months (range, 1.7-96.5 months). No metastasis or VHL-associated mortality was observed. VHL-associated RCC is a relatively low-risk disease, and a tumor size of 4 cm was determined as a threshold for nephron-sparing surgery. In addition, to prevent tumor cell dispersion, renal cysts should be carefully treated. A comprehensive understanding of the clinicopathological characteristics and underlying mechanisms of RCC associated with VHL syndrome may improve patient prognosis.

N2  - Purpose The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence and clinical predictors of germline cancer susceptibility mutations in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MM). Methods We performed targeted capture and next-generation sequencing of 85 cancer susceptibility genes on germline DNA from 198 patients with pleural, peritoneal, and tunica vaginalis MM. Results Twenty-four germline mutations were identified in 13 genes in 23 (12%) of 198 patients. BAP1 mutations were the most common (n = 6; 25%). The remaining were in genes involved in DNA damage sensing and repair (n = 14), oxygen sensing (n = 2), endosome trafficking (n = 1), and cell growth (n = 1). Pleural site (odds ratio [OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.58; P, .01), asbestos exposure (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.72; P, .01), and older age (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99; P = .01) were associated with decreased odds of carrying a germline mutation, whereas having a second cancer diagnosis (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.22 to 9.07; P = .02) significantly increased the odds. The odds of carrying a mutation in BAP1 (OR, 1,658; 95% CI, 199 to 76,224; P, .001), BRCA2 (OR, 5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 14.7; P = .03), CDKN2A (OR, 53; 95% CI, 6 to 249; P, .001), TMEM127 (OR, 88; 95% CI, 1.7 to 1,105; P = .01), VHL (OR, 51; 95% CI, 1.1 to 453; P = .02), and WT1 (OR, 20; 95% CI, 0.5 to 135; P = .049) were significantly higher in MM cases than in a noncancer control population. Tumor sequencing identified mutations in a homologous recombination pathway gene in 52% (n = 29 of 54). Conclusion A significant proportion of patients with MM carry germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes, especially those with peritoneal MM, minimal asbestos exposure, young age, and a second cancer diagnosis. These data support clinical germline genetic testing for patients with MM and provide a rationale for additional investigation of the homologous recombination pathway in MM.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  - The current World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of renal tumours is based on characteristic histological features or specific molecular alterations. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) alteration is the hallmark of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). After identification of the MiT translocation family of tumours, clear cell papillary renal cancer and others, the group of ccRCC with wild-type VHL is small. TCEB1 mutation combined with chromosome 8q loss is an emerging tumour entity with wild-type VHL. Inactivation of TCEB1 increases HIF stabilisation via the same mechanism as VHL inactivation. Importantly, recent molecular analyses suggest the existence of another 'VHL wild-type' evolutionary subtype of clear cell RCC in addition to TCEB1 mutated RCC and clear cell papillary renal cancer. These tumours are characterised by an aggressive behaviour, high tumour cell proliferation rate, elevated chromosomal instability and frequent presence of sarcomatoid differentiation. Future clinicopathological studies will have to provide data to determine whether TCEB1 tumours and clear cell RCC with wild-type VHL are separate tumour entities or represent variants of a clear cell RCC tumour family.

N2  - EPAS1 encodes HIF2 and is closely related to high altitude chronic hypoxia. Mutations in the EPAS1 coding sequence are associated with several kinds of human diseases, including syndromic congenital heart disease (CHD). However, whether there are rare EPAS1 coding variants related to Tibetan non-syndromic CHD have not been fully investigated. A group of 286 Tibetan patients with non-syndromic CHD and 250 unrelated Tibetan healthy controls were recruited from Qinghai, China. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify variations in the EPAS1 coding sequence. The novelty of identified variants was confirmed by the examination of 1000G and ExAC databases. Control samples were screened to establish that the rare candidate variants were specific to the Tibetan patients with non-syndromic CHD. Bioinformatics software was used to assess the conservation of the mutations and to predict their effects. The effect of EPAS1 mutations on the transcription of its target gene, VEGF, was assessed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The mammalian two-hybrid assay was used to study the protein interactions between HIF2 and PHD2 or pVHL. We identified two novel EPAS1 mutations (NM 001430: c.607A>C, p.N203H; c.2170G>T, p.G724W) in two patients. The N203H mutation significantly affected the transcription activity of the VEGF promoter, especially in conditions of hypoxia. The N203H mutation also showed enhanced protein-protein interactions between HIF2 and PHD2, and HIF2 and pVHL, especially in conditions of hypoxia. However, the G724W mutation did not demonstrate the same effects. Our results indicate that EPAS1 mutations might have a potential causative effect on the development of Tibetan non-syndromic CHD.

N2  - Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCC) remains incurable despite advances in the development of anti-angiogenic targeted therapies and the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We have previously shown that the sonic hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway is oncogenic in CCC allowing us to identify the developmental Lim1 transcription factor as a Gli target and as a new oncogene in CCC regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and promoting tumor growth. In this previous study, preliminary in vitro results also suggested that Lim1 may be implicated in metastatic spread. Here we investigated the potential pro-metastatic role of Lim1 in advanced CCC (1) in vitro using a panel of CCC cell lines expressing or not the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene either naturally or by gene transfer and (2) ex vivo in 30 CCC metastatic tissues, including lymph nodes, lung, skin, bone, and adrenal metastases, and (3) in vivo, using a metastatic model by intravenous injection of siRNA-transfected cells into Balb/c nude. Our in vitro results reveal that Lim1 knockdown time-dependently decreased CCC cell motility, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity by up to 50% regardless of their VHL status. Investigating the molecular machinery involved in these processes, we identified a large panel of Lim1 targets known to be involved in cell adhesion (paxillin and fibronectin), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Twist1/2 and snail), invasion (MMP1/2/3/8/9), and metastatic progression (CXCR4, SDF-1, and ANG-1). Importantly, Lim1 was found constitutively expressed in all metastatic tissues. The H-score in metastatic tissues being significantly superior to the score in the corresponding primary tumor tissues (P value = 0.009). Furthermore, we showed that Lim1 silencing decreases pulmonary metastasis development in terms of number and size in the in vivo metastatic model of human CCC. Taken together, these experiments strengthen the potential therapeutic value of Lim1 targeting as a promising novel approach for treating metastatic human CCC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Aberrant methylation is a known cause of cancer initiation and/or progression. There are scant data on the genome-wide methylation pattern of nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NFPanNETs) and sporadic and hereditary NFPanNETs. METHODS: Thirty-three tissue samples were analyzed: they included samples from sporadic (n = 9), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-related (n = 10), and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)-related NFPanNETs (n = 10) as well as normal islet cells (n = 4) for comparison. Genome-wide CpG methylation profiling was performed with the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay and was analyzed with R-based tools. RESULTS: In unsupervised hierarchical clustering, sporadic and MEN1-related NFPanNETs clustered together, and the VHL group was in a separate cluster. MEN1-related NFPanNETs had a higher rate of hypermethylated CpG sites in comparison with sporadic and VHL-related tumor groups. Differentially methylated region analysis confirmed the higher rate of hypermethylation in MEN1-related tumors. Moreover, in an integrated analysis of gene expression data for the same tumor samples, downregulated gene expression was found in most genes that were hypermethylated. In a CpG island methylator phenotype analysis, 3 genes were identified and confirmed to have downregulated gene expression: secreted frizzle-related protein 5 (SFRP5) in sporadic NFPanNETs and cell division cycle-associated 7-like (CDCA7L) and RNA binding motif 47 (RBM47) in MEN1-related NFPanNETs. CONCLUSIONS: MEN1 NFPanNETs have a higher rate of geno me-wide hypermethylation than other NFPanNET subtypes. The similarity between the pathways enriched in a methylation analysis of known genes involved in NFPanNET tumorigenesis suggests a key role for aberrant methylation in the pathogenesis of NFPanNETs.

N2  - A novel mutation in the MLH1 gene likely to be pathogenic for Lynch syndrome was discovered in a proband with a family history of colon cancer. Immunohistochemistry showed negative expression of PMS2 and MLH1 in the resected tumor sample. The mutation lies at the highly conserved C-Terminus of the MLH1 protein, the region through which it dimerizes with PMS2 to carry out its mismatch repair function.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is relatively resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) accounts for the majority of RCC, which have mutations or epigenetic silencing of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. VHL-positive Caki-2 cells are killed by an endogenous anticancer substance, 15-deoxy-DELTA<sup>12, 14</sup>-prostaglandin J<sub>2</sub> (15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>). The MTT reduction assay reflecting mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity was employed for assessment of cell viability. We confirmed anticancer activities of camptothecin (topoisomerase I inhibitor), etoposide (topoisomerase II inhibitor), doxorubicin (topoisomerase II inhibitor) in VHL-positive Caki-2 cells. Combination of topoisomerase inhibitors with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> exhibited the synergistic effect in VHL-positive Caki-2 cells. However, 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> did not increase cytotoxicities of topoisomerase inhibitors on VHL-negative 786-O cells. In addition, the 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>-enhanced antitumor activity of topoisomerase inhibitors was detected in neither VHL-positive nor VHL-negative RCC4 cells. Our finding indicated that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> enhanced the antitumor activity of topoisomerase inhibitors independently of VHL.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and cereblon (CRBN) proteins are substrate recognition subunits of two ubiquitously expressed and biologically important Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. VHL and CRBN are also the two most popular E3 ligases being recruited by bifunctional Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to induce ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of a target protein. Using homo-PROTACs, VHL and CRBN have been independently dimerized to induce their own degradation. Here we report the design, synthesis and cellular activity of VHL-CRBN hetero-dimerizing PROTACs featuring diverse conjugation patterns. We found that the most active compound 14a induced potent, rapid and profound preferential degradation of CRBN over VHL in cancer cell lines. At lower concentrations, weaker degradation of VHL was instead observed. This work demonstrates proof of concept of designing PROTACs to hijack different E3 ligases against each other, and highlights a powerful and generalizable proximity-induced strategy to achieve E3 ligase knockdown.

N2  - Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its alpha-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-alpha to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.

N2  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms at the posttranscriptional level. More than half of miRNA genes have been recognized to be located in different fragile sites. Among them, miR-510 was located on chromosome X in the 27.3Xq region, flanking to a fragile X site. The CGG expansion and its methylation at the promoter of FMR1 located in this fragile site were associated with clinical symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS). The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the miR-510 expression was correlated with the CGG expansion of FMR1 in female carriers of full mutation. For this purpose, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from peripheral blood of FMR1 full mutation female carriers. After differentiation of these cells into neuronal cells, the expression of miR-510 was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the target genes of miR-510 in the nervous system were also predicted by in silico method. The obtained results indicated that the CGG expansion of FMR1 was associated with the enhanced expression of miR-510. Furthermore, the bioinformatics analysis suggested that VHL and PPP2R5E genes could be considered as the most important target genes of miR-510 in the nervous system. This study showed that miR-510 and its target genes, specifically VHL and PPP2R5E, may represent the new targets for future therapy options of FXS. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: We investigated the frequencies and characteristics of intragenic copy-number variants (CNVs) in a deep sampling of disease genes associated with monogenic disorders. Method(s): Subsets of 1507 genes were tested using next-generation sequencing to simultaneously detect sequence variants and CNVs in >143,000 individuals referred for genetic testing. We analyzed CNVs in gene panels for hereditary cancer syndromes and cardiovascular, neurological, or pediatric disorders. Result(s): Our analysis identified 2844 intragenic CNVs in 384 clinically tested genes. CNVs were observed in 1.9% of the entire cohort but in a disproportionately high fraction (9.8%) of individuals with a clinically significant result. CNVs accounted for 4.7-35% of pathogenic variants, depending on clinical specialty. Distinct patterns existed among CNVs in terms of copy number, location, exons affected, clinical classification, and genes affected. Separately, analysis of de-identified data for 599 genes unrelated to the clinical phenotype yielded 4054 CNVs. Most of these CNVs were novel rare events, present as duplications, and enriched in genes associated with recessive disorders or lacking loss-of-function mutational mechanisms. Conclusion(s): Universal intragenic CNV analysis adds substantial clinical sensitivity to genetic testing. Clinically relevant CNVs have distinct properties that distinguish them from CNVs contributing to normal variation in human disease genes. Copyright © 2018, The Author(s).

N2  - The field of hereditary kidney cancer has begun to mature following the identification of several germline syndromes that define genetic and molecular features of this cancer. Molecular defects within these hereditary syndromes demonstrate consistent deficits in angiogenesis and metabolic signaling, largely driven by altered hypoxia signaling. The classical mutation, loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, provides a human pathogenesis model for critical aspects of pseudohypoxia. These features are mimicked in a less common hereditary renal tumor syndrome, known as hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma. Here, we review renal tumor angiogenesis and metabolism from a HIF-centric perspective, considering alterations in the hypoxic landscape, and molecular deviations resulting from high levels of HIF family members. Mutations underlying HIF deregulation drive multifactorial aberrations in angiogenic signals and metabolism. The mechanisms by which these defects drive tumor growth are still emerging. However, the distinctive patterns of angiogenesis and glycolysis-/glutamine-dependent bioenergetics provide insight into the cellular environment of these cancers. The result is a scenario permissive for aggressive tumorigenesis especially within the proximal renal tubule. These features of tumorigenesis have been highly actionable in kidney cancer treatments, and will likely continue as central tenets of kidney cancer therapeutics.
