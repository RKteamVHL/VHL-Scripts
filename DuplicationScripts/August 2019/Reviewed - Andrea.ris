N2  - In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene and reduced oxygen tension promote stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors, which promote changes in the expression of genes that contribute to oncogenesis. Multiple studies have demonstrated significant perturbations in DNA methylation in ccRCC via largely unclear mechanisms that modify the transcriptional output of tumour cells. Here, we show that the methylation status of the CpG dinucleotide within the consensus hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) markedly influences the binding of HIF and that the loss of VHL results in significant alterations in the DNA methylome. Surprisingly, hypoxia, which likewise promotes HIF stabilisation and activation, has relatively few effects on global DNA methylation. Gene expression analysis of ccRCC patient samples highlighted expression of a group of genes whose transcription correlated with methylation changes, including hypoxic responsive genes such as VEGF and TGF. These results suggest that the loss of VHL alters DNA methylation profile across the genome, commonly associated with and contributing to ccRCC progression.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the chromaffin cells of the sympathetic nervous system. Over one third of pheochromocytomas are associated with germline mutations. We describe a 3 year-old girl with an inherited right adrenal malignant pheochromocytoma, with the mother diagnosed with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Genetic tests revealed the presence of the VHL c 244 C>G (p. Arg 82 Gly) heterozygote mutation in the mother, as well as in the child. After 6 months from the complete resection of the tumor, the patient is without any clinical symptoms, with normal blood pressure, normal ophthalmoscopy, no tumor markers and no evidence of tumor on cerebral or abdominal MRI. Lifelong complex follow-up is needed, as it is known that at a later age VHL mutation may cause retinal angiomas, cerebellar and spinal hemangioblastomas, relapsed pheocromocytoma, pancreatic and renal cysts, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and endolymphatic sac tumors.

N2  - The E3 ubiquitin ligase, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), regulates protein expression by polyubiquitination. Although the protein VHL (pVHL) was reported to be involved in the heart function, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that pVHL was upregulated in hearts from two types of genetically dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mice models. In comparison with the wild-type mouse, both DCM mice models showed a significant reduction in the expression of phospholamban (PLN), a potent inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and enhanced interaction between pVHL and PLN. To clarify whether pVHL is involved in PLN degradation in failing hearts, we used carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)-lowering reagent, to mimic the heart failure condition in PLN-expressing HEK293 cells and found that CCCP treatment resulted in PLN degradation and increased interaction between PLN and pVHL. However, these effects were reversed with the addition of N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Furthermore, the co-transfection of VHL and PLN in HEK293 cells decreased PLN expression under oxidative stress, whereas knockdown of VHL increased PLN expression both under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Together, we propose that oxidative stress upregulates pVHL expression to induce PLN degradation in failing hearts.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to determine whether the alterations of cancer predisposition genes were different between radiosensitive and radioresistant patients with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). A total of 21 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included in this study. All patients were treated with standardized radiotherapy. Sixteen of the tumors were clinically radiosensitive and 5 were radioresistant. Genomic DNA, extracted from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens obtained prior to treatment, was subjected to amplicon-based Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) with primer sets targeting 50 critical human tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. We identified 18 nonsynonymous mutations, 1 nonframeshift deletion and 1 frameshift mutation distributed across 15 genes, including 11 mutations have been reported in COSMIC (the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) or dbSNP database (database of single nucleotide polymorphisms), and 9 novel mutations. Most of these mutations have not been reported in NPC. More importantly, 5 radiosensitive-specific mutations targeting AKT1, PIK3CA, MET, TP53 and STK11 were observed, suggesting the genetic alterations of PI3K/AKT and p53 pathways were involved in the response to radiotherapy. Collectively, genetic mutations may differentiate tumor radiosensitivity and radioresistance, although validation of such mutations using a large sample size cohort is necessary before a solid conclusion can be reached.

N2  - BACKGROUND Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome manifested by a spectrum of benign and malignant tumors. CASE REPORT The patient presented here was a 31-year-old female with unremarkable family history who presented initially complaining of intermittent abdominal pain. Abdominal CT scan revealed an inhomogeneous solid mass (13x9x7 cm) originating from the tail of the pancreas with splenic and gastric invasion as well as several pancreatic cysts. A nucleotide scan showed left adrenal involvement. The patient underwent tumor resection, splenectomy, partial gastrectomy, and left adrenalectomy. Histopathologic examination reported well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma with low malignant potential of the tumor with splenic and adrenal involvement. Pancreatic cysts had benign component. Three years later, follow-up abdominal CT showed heterogeneously-enhanced solid nodules in both kidneys found to be renal cell carcinoma (RCC) on biopsy. At the same time, brain MRI showed cerebellar hemangioblastomas. Partial nephrectomy was done. Molecular genetic testing for demonstrated NM_000551.3:c.481C > T (p.R161* CGA>TGA), which has been reported previously in VHL disease. The next year, she developed peritonitis, which found to be the result of a perforated gastric ulcer. Histopathologic examination of the ulcer revealed neuroendocrine carcinoma. Then, the next year, a brain MRI revealed 4 solid and enhanced nodules in the cerebellum, suggesting multiple hemangioblastomas. Octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) and everolimus (Afinitor) were started for the patient. At the last visit, the patient was asymptomatic with acceptable condition. CONCLUSIONS Here, we present a young patient with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor as the first presentation of VHL without a remarkable family history for VHL disease. The patient developed RCC, renal cysts, cardiomegaly, and brain hemangioblastomas during the 8-year follow-up. Regular follow-up with imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) are necessary to follow the previous lesions and detect any newly-developed VHL-associate tumors.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Hemangioblastomas are benign, slow growing but highly vascularized tumors of the central nervous system, with the most common location of occurrence in the posterior fossa. Hemangioblastomas usually have an associated with patients that have Von-Hippel Lindau disease, resulting a germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Isolated or sporadic occurrences of hemangioblastomas are much more infrequent and typically respond well after surgery.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present case of a 22year old female with worsening shoulder pain, decreased sensation in the hands and feet, and decreasing strength and was found to have a hemangioblastoma of the cervical spine.DISCUSSION: The patient was treated with surgery and responded well to treatment. We also present a review of the literature on isolated occurrences of hemangioblastomas of the spinal cord.CONCLUSION: Isolated hemangioblastoma are a rare tumor of the central nervous system and can be managed with surgery.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein serves to recruit the hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF1alpha) protein under normoxia to the CUL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase for its ubiquitylation and degradation through the proteasome. In this report, we modify VHL to engineer an affinity-directed protein missile (AdPROM) system to direct specific endogenous target proteins for proteolysis in mammalian cells. The proteolytic AdPROM construct harbours a cameloid anti-green fluorescence protein (aGFP) nanobody that is fused to VHL for either constitutive or tetracycline-inducible expression. For target proteins, we exploit CRISPR/Cas9 to rapidly generate human kidney HEK293 and U2OS osteosarcoma homozygous knock-in cells harbouring GFP tags at the VPS34 (vacuolar protein sorting 34) and protein associated with SMAD1 (PAWS1, aka FAM83G) loci, respectively. Using these cells, we demonstrate that the expression of the VHL-aGFP AdPROM system results in near-complete degradation of the endogenous GFP-VPS34 and PAWS1-GFP proteins through the proteasome. Additionally, we show that Tet-inducible destruction of GFP-VPS34 results in the degradation of its associated partner, UVRAG, and reduction in levels of cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.

N2  - CLINICAL CASE: A 29-year-old female with bilateral retinal capillary haemangiomas (RCH). A genetic analysis was carried out due to the suspicion of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, with negative results on 2occasions. There was progression of the RCH in the left eye, leading to a macular epiretinal membrane. The patient was treated with laser, intravitreal ranibizumab, and vitrectomy. Finally, a third genetic test detected a de novo mutation in the VHL gene, and led to the genetic diagnosis.DISCUSSION: VHL syndrome causes a complex ocular disease with a difficult diagnosis that requires early treatment of the RCH in order to modify its visual prognosis.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is one of the most common inherited neoplasia syndromes and is characterized by highly vascular tumors of the eyes, brain, and spine, as well as benign and malignant tumors and/or cysts of the kidneys, adrenal medullae and sympathetic paraganglia, endolymphatic sac, epididymis, and broad ligament. Since the discovery of the VHL gene in 1993, more than 900 families with VHL have been identified and examined. Genetic testing for VHL is widely available and will detect a disease-causing mutation in rate 95% to 100% of individuals who have a clinical diagnosis of VHL, making it the standard of care for diagnosis of VHL. Furthermore, genetic testing for VHL is indicated in some individuals with seemingly sporadic VHL-related tumor types, as </= 10% of pheochromocytoma or early-onset renal cell carcinoma and </= 40% of CNS hemangioblastoma harbor germline VHL mutations without a family history or additional features of VHL disease. The majority of VHL mutations are private, but there are also well-characterized founder mutations. VHL is a complex, multiorgan disease that spans the breadth of oncology subspecialties, and, as such, providers in these subspecialties should be aware of when to consider a diagnosis of VHL, when to refer a patient to a genetics specialist for consideration of gene testing, and, perhaps most importantly, how to communicate this sensitive information in an age-appropriate manner to at-risk families. This review will provide state-of-the-art information regarding the genetics of VHL and will serve as a key reference for nongenetics professionals who encounter patients with VHL.

N2  - Tumor suppressor genes and their effector pathways have been identified for many dominantly heritable cancers, enabling efforts to intervene early in the course of disease. Our approach on the subject of early intervention was to investigate gene expression patterns of morphologically normal "one-hit" cells before they become hemizygous or homozygous for the inherited mutant gene which is usually required for tumor formation. Here, we studied histologically non-transformed renal epithelial cells from patients with inherited disorders that predispose to renal tumors, including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC). As controls, we studied histologically normal cells from non-cancerous renal epithelium of patients with sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Gene expression analyses of VHLmut/wt or TSC1/2mut/wt versus wild-type (WT) cells revealed transcriptomic alterations previously implicated in the transition to precancerous renal lesions. For example, the gene expression changes in VHLmut/wt cells were consistent with activation of the hypoxia response, associated, in part, with the "Warburg effect". Knockdown of any remaining VHL mRNA using shRNA induced secondary expression changes, such as activation of NFkappaB and interferon pathways, that are fundamentally important in the development of RCC. We posit that this is a general pattern of hereditary cancer predisposition, wherein haploinsufficiency for VHL or TSC1/2, or potentially other tumor susceptibility genes, is sufficient to promote development of early lesions, while cancer results from inactivation of the remaining normal allele. The gene expression changes identified here are related to the metabolic basis of renal cancer and may constitute suitable targets for early intervention.

N2  - A growing number of studies suggest that the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) enhances the protein stability of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). However, the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV), HBx and hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha) has not yet been fully elucidated. Immunohistochemical analysis was employed to detect the expression of HIF-2alpha in normal liver, HBV-related chronic hepatitis, and HBV-related and non-HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blotting were used to investigate the impact of HBV and HBx on the expression of HIF-2alpha. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were applied to explore the underlying mechanisms. The HIF-2alpha expression was found to be higher in HBV-related chronic hepatitis tissues than in normal liver tissues. Furthermore, it was higher in HBV-related HCC tissues and HBV-integrated HepG2 cells than in the corresponding non-HBV-related HCC tissues and HepG2 cells. Both HBV and HBx enhanced the protein stability of HIF-2alpha. HBx-mediated upregulation of HIF-2alpha resulted mainly from an inhibition of the degradation of HIF-2alpha due to the binding of HBx to the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). In addition, HBx upregulated the expression of HIF-2alpha by activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Thus, the present study identified that HBV induces the HIF-2alpha expression through its encoded protein HBx. This upregulates the HIF-2alpha expression by binding to the pVHL activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is an aggressive tumor that is characterized in most cases by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene VHL. The VHL/HIF/VEGF pathway thus plays a major role in angiogenesis and is currently targeted by anti-angiogenic therapy. The emergence of resistance is leading to the use of targeted immunotherapy against immune checkpoint PD1/PDL1 that restores antitumor immune response. The correlation between VHL status and PD-L1 expression has been little investigated. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 98 consecutive cases of ccRCC and correlated PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with clinical data (up to 10-year follow-up), pathological criteria, VEGF, PAR-3, CAIX and PD-1 expressions by IHC and complete VHL status (deletion, mutation and promoter hypermethylation). PD-L1 expression was observed in 69 ccRCC (70.4%) and the corresponding patients had a worse prognosis, with a median specific survival of 52 months (p=0.03). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with poor prognostic factors such as a higher ISUP nucleolar grade (p=0.01), metastases at diagnosis (p=0.01), a sarcomatoid component (p=0.04), overexpression of VEGF (p=0.006), and cytoplasmic PAR-3 expression (p=0.01). PD-L1 expression was also associated with dense PD-1 expression (p=0.007) and with ccRCC with 0 or 1 alteration(s) (non-inactivated VHL tumors; p=0.007) that remained significant after multivariate analysis (p=0.004 and p=0.024, respectively). Interestingly, all wild-type VHL tumors (no VHL gene alteration, 11.2%) expressed PD-L1. In this study, we found PD-L1 expression to be associated with noninactivated VHL tumors and in particular wild-type VHL ccRCC, which may benefit from therapies inhibiting PD-L1/PD-1.

N1  - 10th Annual Meeting of the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society. United States
N2  - Background: About 20% of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHLd) harbor pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). vHLd patients with missense VHL mutations have more severe phenotype, reflected also by higher risk to develop PNETs metastases. In the current analysiswe aimed to further define PNETs prognosis according to VHL genotype. Methods: A prospective study of patients with vHLd and pancreatic lesions with imaging follow-up. Prediction of VHL mutation impact was analyzed using five computational prediction models (PolyPhen-2: HumVar and HumDiv, SNPs&Go, PANTHER and PhD-SNP). Patients were divided into those with prediction >80% for disease causing mutations in all models (High predicted risk, HPR), and others (Low predicted risk, LPR). The risk for metastases, requiring an intervention and disease progression (>20%growth of the largest lesion) during follow-up were compared between the groups. Patients with >1 prediction with low reliability index (<5) were excluded. Results: 69 patients with missense VHL mutations, 13 patients were excluded for low prediction reliability. In the remaining 56 patients (45 with PNETs, 11 with pancreatic cysts), 43 and 13 were included in the HPR and LPR groups, respectively. Two patients developed metastatic disease, 12 required surgical intervention and 31 had disease progression during a median follow-up of 60 months (range, 13-84). In the survival analysis, HPR group had higher rate of disease progression both in univariate (log-rank test, P = 0.006), and multivariable analysis, controlling for number of PNETs, evaluation rate, hotspot mutation, gender, age and tumor diameter (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.1-11.9; P = 0.037), and for developing metastases (P = 0.015). Among the patients with codon 167 hotspot mutations (n = 26), those in HPR vs. LPR groups had higher risk for disease progression (P = 0.03). Conclusion: Computational models for predictions of the VHL protein function may be used as a prognostic factor in patientswith PNETs in the context of vHLd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Posterior cranial fossa (PCF) hemangioblastomas are benign, highly vascularized, and well-differentiated tumors with well-described histopathologic features. Although relatively rare, this tumor is the most prevalent primary tumor of the cerebellum in adults.OBJECTIVE: Because the demographics of patients with such a tumor (as well as the clinical, morphologic, pathologic, surgical features, and outcomes) are not fully understood, we systematized characteristic patient and tumor features.METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of the English-language literature in PubMed for PCF hemangioblastomas in adults published in the past 31 years. We analyzed geographic distribution and year of publication of articles; demographic data of patients; presenting symptoms and clinical signs; tumor location and morphology; histopathologic features, extent of tumor resection, perioperative blood loss, and postoperative complications; length of hospital stay; and outcomes.RESULTS: We reviewed 207 articles describing 1759 infratentorial hemangioblastomas in a cohort of 1515 adult patients. We found female predominance in patients with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD) compared with male predominance in the general patient group. Symptoms of intracranial hypertension were more common in the VHLD group compared with the general group of patients. The cerebellar location was more common in the VHLD group and solid (parenchymatous) tumor was the most common type. Most patients underwent total resection but rate of resection did not differ between the general and VHLD groups. Most patients had a favorable outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The literature of adult PCF hemangioblastomas is limited and general surgical experience with such tumors is scarce because of their rarity. Rates of postoperative complications and mortality remain higher than expected. However, prognosis and surgical outcomes are generally favorable. Nevertheless, surgery of adult PCF hemangioblastomas is a demanding and challenging task.

N2  - Large genome sequencing efforts have identified frequent mutations in the histone-modifying and chromatin-remodeling genes BAP1 and PBRM1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Gu and colleagues model these genetic events in mice and report that dual inactivation of Vhl with either Bap1 or Pbrm1 results in faithful genetically engineered murine models of ccRCC. Moreover, their work establishes that Bap1 and Pbrm1 are determinants of tumor grade and mTORC1 activation and provocatively suggests that the cell of origin of ccRCC may lie in PAX8-expressing Bowman capsule cells.

N2  - Zebrafish are increasingly being used to study cancer. Almost all tumor types have been found in zebrafish. However, tumor incidence is relatively low and tumors develop late in life. Functional inactivation of tumor suppressors is a crucial step in cancer progression and more and more tumor suppressor genes are being studied in zebrafish. Most often tumor suppressors have been inactivated by reverse genetics approaches using targeted disruption. However, some tumor suppressor mutants were identified by forward genetic screens for mutants with a particular phenotype. Some of the latter genes had not been recognized as tumor suppressors yet. Similarly, a screen for genes that suppress tumor formation in zebrafish in vivo led to the identification of a novel tumor suppressor gene. In this review, I will provide an overview of what the zebrafish has taught us about tumor suppressors. Copyright © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease associated with mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p25. VHL is characterized by the development of multiple malignant and benign tumours in the central nervous system and internal organs, including liver, pancreas and the adrenal gland. More than 823 different mutations of the VHL gene have currently been identified. In the present study we describe the case of a family affected by VHL treated at the University Hospital of La Ribera and the results of the genetic analysis of three relatives, identifying the mutation R167G in exon 3 of VHL gene as the cause of VHL syndrome in this family.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a familial neoplastic condition seen in approximately 1 in 36,000 live births. It is caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL, located on the short arm of chromosome 3. While the majority of the affected individuals have a positive family history, up to 20% of cases arise from de novo mutations. VHL syndrome is characterized by the presence of benign and malignant tumors affecting the central nervous system, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, and reproductive organs. Common manifestations include hemangioblastomas of the brain, spinal cord, and retina; pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; renal cell carcinoma; pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; and endolymphatic sac tumors. Diagnosis of VHL is prompted by clinical suspicion and confirmed by molecular testing. Management of VHL patients is complex and multidisciplinary. Routine genetic testing and surveillance using various diagnostic techniques are used to help monitor disease progression and implement treatment options. Despite recent advances in clinical diagnosis and management, life expectancy for VHL patients remains low at 40-52 years. This article provides an overview of the major clinical, histological, and radiological findings, as well as treatment modalities.

N2  - Recent guidelines recommend consideration of genetic screening in all newly diagnosed patients with pheochromocytoma. Patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma in the Region of Southern Denmark during 2006-2013 without previously recognized monogenetic etiology were offered genetic screening for mutations in the VHL, RET, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes. A total of 41 patients were included, and genetic data were available in 35. In four of the 35 patients, a pathogenic variant was identified prior to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma (von Hippel-Lindau disease, n=2; neurofibromatosis type 1, n=2). The patients carrying a genetic mutation were all younger than 45 years at time of diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, two patients presented with bilateral tumors, and one patient had a positive family history of pheochromocytoma. Genetic screening of the remaining 31 patients did not identify any mutations. The sporadic cases had a median age of 58 years (range 33-80 years). Three of 31 sporadic cases (ages 60, 69, and 76 years at time of diagnosis) presented with bilateral adrenal tumors, one patient had multiple adrenal tumors in both adrenal glands, and no patients had a positive family history of pheochromocytoma. Of the 31 patients, 24 (68.6%) were diagnosed with pheochromocytoma due to evaluation of an adrenal incidentaloma. In conclusion, monogenetic etiology was identified in four of 35 (11.4%) patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common form of Kidney cancer, is characterized by frequent mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene in ~85% of sporadic cases. Loss of pVHL function affects multiple cellular processes, among which the activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway is the best-known function. Constitutive activation of HIF signaling in turn activates hundreds of genes involved in numerous oncogenic pathways, which contribute to the development or progression of ccRCC. Although VHL mutations are considered as drivers of ccRCC, they are not sufficient to cause the disease. Recent genome-wide sequencing studies of ccRCC have revealed that mutations of genes coding for epigenome modifiers and chromatin remodelers, including PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1, are the most common somatic genetic abnormalities after VHL mutations in these tumors. Moreover, recent research has shed light on the extent of abnormal epigenome alterations in ccRCC tumors, including aberrant DNA methylation patterns, abnormal histone modifications and deregulated expression of non-coding RNAs. In this review, we discuss the epigenetic modifiers that are commonly mutated in ccRCC, and our growing knowledge of the cellular processes that are impacted by them. Furthermore, we explore new avenues for developing therapeutic approaches based on our knowledge of epigenome aberrations of ccRCC.

N2  - Human cancers are known to downregulate Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I expression thereby escaping recognition and rejection by anti-tumor T cells. Here we report that oxygen tension in the tumor microenvironment (TME) serves as an extrinsic cue that regulates antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules. In support of this view, hypoxia is shown to negatively regulate MHC expression in a HIF-dependent manner as evidenced by (i) lower MHC expression in the hypoxic TME in vivo and in hypoxic 3-dimensional (3D) but not 2-dimensional (2D) tumor cell cultures in vitro; (ii) decreased MHC in human renal cell carcinomas with constitutive expression of HIF due to genetic loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) function as compared with isogenically paired cells with restored VHL function, and iii) increased MHC in tumor cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF. In addition, hypoxia downregulated antigen presenting proteins like TAP 1/2 and LMP7 that are known to have a dominant role in surface display of peptide-MHC complexes. Corroborating oxygen-dependent regulation of MHC antigen presentation, hyperoxia (60% oxygen) transcriptionally upregulated MHC expression and increased levels of TAP2, LMP2 and 7. In conclusion, this study reveals a novel mechanism by which intra-tumoral hypoxia and HIF can potentiate immune escape. It also suggests the use of hyperoxia to improve tumor cell-based cancer vaccines and for mining novel immune epitopes. Furthermore, this study highlights the advantage of 3D cell cultures in reproducing hypoxia-dependent changes observed in the TME.

N2  - About 5-10% of cancers are thought to be hereditary of which a single gene mutation is responsible for cancer development. Hereditary cancers often show different clinical courses from those of sporadic cancers. Accordingly, different clinical management can be chosen for hereditary- and sporadic cancers. Appropriate diagnosis of hereditary cancer is thus important as it enables to offer patients better and personalized management of their cancers. Also, it enables identify at-risk family members and if they have the same genetic defect as the proband, early intervention including early, and specialized surveillance and prophylactic treatment for some tumors. There are a number of hereditary endocrine tumor syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), MEN2, von-Hippel Lindau disease, and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, which manifest various endocrine- and non-endocrine tumors. Besides these, non-syndromic hereditary single tumor such as hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome, familial isolated hyperparathyroidism and familial isolated pituitary adenoma are also known. These syndromes based on the pathological germline mutation of the responsible gene and the mutation can be transmitted to the offspring. In the case of MEN2, nearly all patients develop medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) as early as in childhood, As about 30% of patients with MTC have MEN2 as their genetic background, all patients with MTC is strongly recommended to have genetic testing for MEN2 (RET mutation analysis). Once pathological germline mutation is detected, surgical procedure for MTC, surveillance for pheochromocytoma, and presymptomatic genetic testing for at-risk relatives are considered. In 2016, RET mutation analysis was added to the list of insurance-covered genetic testing in Japan. This will facilitate to perform testing at clinical practice which will reduce proportion of undiagnosed patients, while it could cause some complex problems related genetic counseling and family matters. All clinicians should be aware the power and impact of genetic information on clinical management and that on patients and family members.

N2  - Cytosine5-hyxymethylation (5hmC)which is a new epigenetic modification form plays important roles in the development and progression of tumors. In the present study, we observed that levels of 5hmC in the promoter region of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) were lower in 97 samples of renal clear cell carcinoma tissue than in matched adjacent benign tissues. Moreover, when the cancer tissue samples were divided based on pathological staging, VHL expression and the level of 5hmC in the VHL promoter were both lower in pathological grade III tumors than in grades I or II. Correspondingly, expression of TET1, which catalyzes the formation of 5hmC, was also lower in grade III renal clear cell carcinomas than in grade I or II disease. These findings suggest the 5hmC level on VHL is a key determinant of the gene's expression and may participate in the occurrence and development of renal clear cell carcinoma. Thus the 5hmC level may be a useful indicator for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of renal clear cell carcinoma.

N2  - The presence of sarcomatoid features in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) confers a poor prognosis and is of unknown pathogenesis. We performed exome sequencing of matched normal-carcinomatous-sarcomatoid specimens from 21 subjects. Two tumors had hypermutation consistent with mismatch repair deficiency. In the remainder, sarcomatoid and carcinomatous elements shared 42% of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SSNVs). Sarcomatoid elements had a higher overall SSNV burden (mean 90 vs. 63 SSNVs, P = 4.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>), increased frequency of nonsynonymous SSNVs in Pan-Cancer genes (mean 1.4 vs. 0.26, P = 0.002), and increased frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across the genome (median 913 vs. 460 Mb in LOH, P < 0.05), with significant recurrent LOH on chromosomes 1p, 9, 10, 14, 17p, 18, and 22. The most frequent SSNVs shared by carcinomatous and sarcomatoid elements were in known ccRCC genes including von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), polybromo 1 (PBRM1), SET domain containing 2 (SETD2), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Most interestingly, sarcomatoid elements acquired biallelic tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations in 32% of tumors (P = 5.47 x 10<sup>-17</sup>); TP53 mutations were absent in carcinomatous elements in nonhypermutated tumors and rare in previously studied ccRCCs. Mutations in known cancer drivers ATrich interaction domain 1A (ARID1A) and BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) were significantly mutated in sarcomatoid elements and were mutually exclusive with TP53 and each other. These findings provide evidence that sarcomatoid elements arise from dedifferentiation of carcinomatous ccRCCs and implicate specific genes in this process. These findings have implications for the treatment of patients with these poor-prognosis cancers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The growing number of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) tests is transforming the routine clinical diagnosis of hereditary cancers. Identifying whether a cancer is the result of an underlying disease-causing mutation in a cancer predisposition gene is not only diagnostic for a cancer predisposition syndrome, but also has significant clinical implications in the clinical management of patients and their families.METHODS: Here, we evaluated the performance of MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) in detecting genetic alterations in 76 genes implicated in cancer predisposition syndromes. Output from hybridization-based capture was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. A custom analysis pipeline was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variants (CNVs).RESULTS: MSK-IMPACT detected all germline variants in a set of 233 unique patient DNA samples, previously confirmed by previous single gene testing. Reproducibility of variant calls was demonstrated using inter- and intra- run replicates. Moreover, in 16 samples, we identified additional pathogenic mutations other than those previously identified through a traditional gene-by-gene approach, including founder mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 and APC, and truncating mutations in TP53, TSC2, ATM and VHL.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of the NGS-based gene panel testing approach in comprehensively identifying germline variants contributing to cancer predisposition and simultaneous detection of somatic and germline alterations.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a multisystem genetic disease, the cardinal manifestations of which include central nervous system hemangioblastomas (CNS HB), renal cell carcinomas (RCC), and pheochromocytoma. Tumorigenesis in VHL of both RCC and CNS HB occurs secondary to downstream effects of a mutated or absent VHL protein. Treatment of RCCs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Pazopanib is now first line therapy, but their effect on VHL-associated CNS HBs remains unknown. We report the use of Pazopanib in a patient with VHL disease for treatment of RCC who also harbored multiple CNS HBs. Following initiation of treatment, a large cervical and a lumbar spinal HB regressed in size while the remaining CNS HBs exhibited stable or progressive disease. These findings highlight the multiplicity of factors contributing to hemangioblastoma development, even among tumors with a common germline mutation, and the potential limitations of TKIs, but additionally this report supports the conservative management of asymptomatic VHL patients with spinal HBs whereby tumor response to TKI treatment may alleviate or postpone the need for surgery.

N2  - We previously reported that the dietary flavonoids, luteolin and quercetin, might inhibit the invasiveness of cervical cancer by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling. However, the regulatory mechanism exerted by luteolin and quercetin is still unclear. This study analyzed the invasiveness activation by ubiquitin E2S ligase (UBE2S) through EMT signaling and inhibition by luteolin and quercetin. We found that UBE2S expression was significantly higher in highly invasive A431 subgroup III (A431-III) than A431-parental (A431-P) cells. UBE2S small interfering (si)RNA knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that UBE2S increased the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells through EMT signaling. Luteolin and quercetin significantly inhibited UBE2S expression. UBE2S showed a negative correlation with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and a positive correlation with hypoxia-induced factor (Hif)-1alpha. Our findings suggest that high UBE2S in malignant cancers contributes to cell motility through EMT signaling and is reversed by luteolin and quercetin. UBE2S might contribute to Hif-1alpha signaling in cervical cancer. These results show the metastatic inhibition of cervical cancer by luteolin and quercetin through reducing UBE2S expression, and provide a functional role for UBE2S in the motility of cervical cancer. UBE2S could be a potential therapeutic target in cervical cancer.

N2  - Hypoxia is a critical driver of cancer pathogenesis, directly inducing malignant phenotypes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stem cell-like characteristics and metabolic transformation. However, hypoxia-associated phenotypes are often observed in cancer in the absence of hypoxia, a phenotype known as pseudohypoxia, which is very well documented in specific tumour types, including in paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma (PPGL). Approximately 40% of the PPGL tumours carry a germ line mutation in one of a number of susceptibility genes of which those that are found in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) or in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) genes manifest a strong pseudohypoxic phenotype. Mutations in SDH are oncogenic, forming tumours in a select subset of tissues, but the cause for this remains elusive. Although elevated succinate levels lead to increase in hypoxia-like signalling, there are other phenotypes that are being increasingly recognised in SDH-mutated PPGL, such as DNA hypermethylation. Further, recently unveiled changes in metabolic re-wiring of SDH-deficient cells might help to decipher cancer related roles of SDH in the future. In this review, we will discuss the various implications that the malfunctioning SDH can have and its impact on cancer development.

N2  - The autosomal dominant von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is associated with a lifelong risk of tumor development, especially retinal and CNS hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Knowledge of paediatric vHL development is limited, and current surveillance guidelines are based on expert opinions. We aimed to describe the course of vHL development in children and adolescents, focusing on age at first manifestation, manifestation frequencies, and types. The prevalence of vHL diagnosis as well as manifestations in childhood were evaluated based on 99 patients, who had started surveillance before 18 years: 37 Danish patients from the national vHL research database and 62 international patients reported in 15 articles. Overall, 70% (69 of 99) developed manifestations before 18 years (median age at first manifestation: 12 years (range: 6-17 years)). Thirty per cent (30 of 99) had developed more than one manifestation type; the most frequent were retinal (34%) and CNS (30%) hemangioblastomas. Among the 37 Danish patients, 85% (97 of 116) of their tumors were asymptomatic. Vision outcome is significantly improved in hemangioblastomas that are treated while still asymptomatic. We agree with current guidelines that retinal surveillance be performed from birth. The patients had their first CNS hemangioblastomas at the median ages of 13-14 years (range: 6-17 years). Further, 11% (4 of 37) of the Danish patients had CNS surgery in their teenage years. Although the cohort is too small to make definite conclusions about specific initiation ages, regular CNS surveillance from vHL patients' teenage years seems clinically relevant.

N2  - RATIONALE: Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and its major product inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) regulate a variety of cellular functions, but their role in vascular biology remains unexplored.OBJECTIVE: We have investigated the role of IPMK in regulating angiogenesis.METHODS AND RESULTS: Deletion of IPMK in fibroblasts induces angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models. IPMK deletion elicits a substantial increase of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which mediates the regulation of angiogenesis by IPMK. The regulation of VEGF by IPMK requires its catalytic activity. IPMK is predominantly nuclear and regulates gene transcription. However, IPMK does not apparently serve as a transcription factor for VEGF. HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-1alpha is a major determinant of angiogenesis and induces VEGF transcription. IPMK deletion elicits a major enrichment of HIF-1alpha protein and thus VEGF. HIF-1alpha is constitutively ubiquitinated by pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein) followed by proteasomal degradation under normal conditions. However, HIF-1alpha is not recognized and ubiquitinated by pVHL in IPMK KO (knockout) cells. IP5 reinstates the interaction of HIF-1alpha and pVHL. HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation, which is prerequisite for pVHL recognition, is interrupted in IPMK-deleted cells. IP5 promotes HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha. Deletion of IPMK in mouse brain increases HIF-1alpha/VEGF levels and vascularization. The increased VEGF in IPMK KO disrupts blood-brain barrier and enhances brain blood vessel permeability.CONCLUSIONS: IPMK, via its product IP5, negatively regulates angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF expression. IP5 acts by enhancing HIF-1alpha hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha.

N2  - Glucocorticoid (GC) and hypoxic transcriptional responses play a central role in tissue homeostasis and regulate the cellular response to stress and inflammation, highlighting the potential for cross-talk between these two signaling pathways. We present results from an unbiased in vivo chemical screen in zebrafish that identifies GCs as activators of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in the liver. GCs activated consensus hypoxia response element (HRE) reporters in a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent manner. Importantly, GCs activated HIF transcriptional responses in a zebrafish mutant line harboring a point mutation in the GR DNA-binding domain, suggesting a nontranscriptional route for GR to activate HIF signaling. We noted that GCs increase the transcription of several key regulators of glucose metabolism that contain HREs, suggesting a role for GC/HIF cross-talk in regulating glucose homeostasis. Importantly, we show that GCs stabilize HIF protein in intact human liver tissue and isolated hepatocytes. We find that GCs limit the expression of Von Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL), a negative regulator of HIF, and that treatment with the c-src inhibitor PP2 rescued this effect, suggesting a role for GCs in promoting c-src-mediated proteosomal degradation of pVHL. Our data support a model for GCs to stabilize HIF through activation of c-src and subsequent destabilization of pVHL.

N2  - The characteristic morphologic spectrum of tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma (TC-RCC) may include areas resembling papillary RCC (PRCC). Our study includes 15 RCCs with tubulocystic pattern: 6 TC-RCCs, 1 RCC-high grade with tubulocystic architecture, 5 TC-RCCs with foci of PRCC, 2 with high-grade RCC (HGRCC) not otherwise specified, and 1 with a clear cell papillary RCC/renal angiomyoadenomatous tumor-like component. We analyzed aberrations of chromosomes 7, 17, and Y; mutations of VHL and FH genes; and loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 3p. Genetic analysis was performed separately in areas of classic TC-RCC and in those with other histologic patterns. The TC-RCC component demonstrated disomy of chromosome 7 in 9/15 cases, polysomy of chromosome 17 in 7/15 cases, and loss of Y in 1 case. In the PRCC component, 2/3 analyzable cases showed disomy of chromosome 7 and polysomy of chromosome 17 with normal Y. One case with focal HGRCC exhibited only disomy 7, whereas the case with clear cell papillary RCC/renal angiomyoadenomatous tumor-like pattern showed polysomies of 7 and 17, mutation of VHL, and loss of heterozygosity 3p. FH gene mutation was identified in a single case with an aggressive clinical course and predominant TC-RCC pattern. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) TC-RCC demonstrates variable status of chromosomes 7, 17, and Y even in cases with typical/uniform morphology. (2) The biological nature of PRCC/HGRCC-like areas within TC-RCC remains unclear. Our data suggest that heterogenous TC-RCCs may be associated with an adverse clinical outcome. (3) Hereditary leiomyomatosis-associated RCC can be morphologically indistinguishable from "high-grade" TC-RCC; therefore, in TC-RCC with high-grade features FH gene status should be tested.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is a rare genetic disease. Its incidence is 1 : 36,000, there is the familial occurrence in 80 % of cases, the remaining cases are de novo mutations. The disease is caused by the highly penetrant mutations in the VHL gene (3p25.3) and is characterized by the occurrence of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common VHL tumors are the tumors of the retina, brain and spinal hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, endolymfatic sac tumors and pancreatic tumors and cysts. The mean age of the VHL patients during the diagnosis is 20-40 years. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a positive family history and the presence of one of the typical tumor. In case of no family history, the diagnosis has to be assessed by the presence of the multiple tumors. The clinical signs and prognosis of VHL depend on the location and extent of the tumors. The life expectancy is 50 years. The most common causes of death are complications of the renal cancer and the brain tumors. The treatment requires a multidisciplinary collaboration through the whole life of patients. This 2 cases report we demonstrate the differences among the patients with de novo mutations disease and the patient with familial incidence.

N2  - The aim of this pilot study was to determine if metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) could serve as predictors of biochemical remission and pharmacotherapy-free interval in patients with metastatic pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs). Background: Patients with metastatic PCCs/PGLs have a high rate of biochemical recurrence, which can be associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. Predictors of biochemical response are needed to guide and select patients who may benefit from therapy. Methods: Whole body MTVand TLG was calculated from preoperative 18FFDG PET/CT scans and analyzed as marker of biochemical response and pharmacotherapy-free interval. Results: Seventeen patients underwent a total of 19 procedures, with a median follow-up time of 26.4 months. Whole body MTV of patients with biochemical recurrence (n = 13, mean 73.8 mL) was higher than those who had a biochemical response (n = 6, mean 14.7 mL, P = 0.05). Patients with low MTV (<37.2 mL) had an improved durable partial biochemical response (P < 0.05), and a statistical trend for complete biochemical remission (P = 0.07) and pharmacotherapy-free interval (P = 0.06). In 8 patients with metastatic disease outside the abdomen, 4 patients had less than 35% of their disease burden outside the abdomen and these patients had a more durable partial biochemical response compared to patients with greater than 35% of their disease burden outside the abdomen (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Whole body MTV and TLG represents novel and valuable predictors of biochemical response for patients with metastatic PCCs and PGLs. A larger prospective study should be performed to validate these findings. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  - Background: Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) arise from neuroendocrine cells, which are widely distributed throughout the body. However, diagnosing NET is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and the paucity of experience among health professionals. This retrospective study was carried out to improve our understanding about NET. This knowledge can be used for optimal utilisation and distribution of limited resources. Aim: To study the clinical profile, treatment and survival outcomes for advanced NET patients in Australian regional and remote settings. Methods: We reviewed all adult patients who were diagnosed with NET between 1994 and 2012. Patients' data were extracted from electronic databases of The Townsville Cancer Centre. Remoteness was based on postcodes, with patients stratified as regional or rural North Queensland according to Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC). Overall survival was studied using survival analysis. Results: Data from 79 patients were included in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 60 years. A total of 48 patients (60.8%) was male and 31 (39.2%) female. The majority of the patients lived in rural areas (51, 64%) as compared to residing in regional areas (28, 36%). There were 34 deaths at the study cut-off point. Median overall survival of NET patients in rural areas is significantly less than those living in regional areas (1613 days vs. 2935 days, respectively), P = 0.03. Conclusion: Remoteness has an adverse impact on overall survival of NET patients. This outcome may be because of varied access to health services and/or lack of access to specialised scans and medical and surgical expertise.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant syndrome which occurs secondary to germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 3. Clinically von Hippel-Lindau disease is characterized by an increased risk of developing simple visceral cysts, most commonly in the pancreas and kidneys, in addition to an increased risk of developing neoplasms, often with clear cell features, in a multitude of organ systems. The most common neoplasms are cerebellar and retinal hemangioblastomas, adrenal pheochromocytomas, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic serous cystadenomas, and endolymphatic sac tumors. These lesions most commonly present during adulthood; however, screening and surveillance for the development of these lesions should begin in the pediatric years for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. In this review article, the genetics and most common neoplasms of von Hippel-Lindau disease are reviewed, with an eye towards implications for the pediatric patient.

N2  - Paraganglionoma of the thyroid is an extremely rare tumour, with fewer than thirty cases reported in the literature. These tumours are believed to arise from the inferior laryngeal paraganglia and are most common in females of middle age. Approximately 30% of head and neck paraganglionomas are hereditary, most frequently due to germline mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase gene family, but also in association with disorders including multiple endocrine neoplasia and von-Hippel-Lindau disease. This entity is frequently mistaken for other lesions, including secondary neuroendocrine tumours and follicular neoplasm. Treatment is by total thyroidectomy, or lobectomy for a solitary lesion. Despite the presence of atypical features, malignant transformation of these tumours has not been observed, with no reported recurrences following resection. Copyright © 2018

N2  - Renal angiomyoadenomatous tumor has been described in 2000, followed by description of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma in 2006. Discussions about possible relationship of both tumors were published since their description. The main differential diagnostic feature was considered presence/absence of fibroleiomyomatous stroma-relationship of renal angiomyoadenomatous tumor in stroma-rich tumors. However, it was shown that stroma is reactive and nonneoplastic by its nature and that all other histologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular-genetic features of both entities are identical. In upcoming World Health Organization classification of renal tumors (2016), both lesions are considered as a single entity (clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma [CCPRCC]). Most published cases followed the benign/indolent clinical course. In addition, most tumors has normal status of VHL gene (methylation, LOH 3p, mutations); however, CCPRCC was referred in patients with VHL syndrome. Another issue covered by this review is possible relationship of CCPRCC and "renal cell carcinoma with leiomyomatous stroma" (RCCLS). Renal cell carcinoma with leiomyomatous stroma shows clear cell cytology and abundant leiomyomatous stroma. Some of RCCLS are positive for cytokeratin 7; some are negative. Similar situation exists for relation of RCCLS and VHL gene abnormalities. It is so far unclear whether any relation between CCPRCC and RCCLS exists. From all published studies, it seems that these tumors are less likely related to each other.

N2  - The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the predisposition for multiple tumors caused by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene VHL. This disease is associated with a high morbidity and mortality and presents a variable expression, with different phenotypes from family to family, affecting different organs during the lifetime. The main manifestations of VHL are hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina, renal carcinomas and cysts, bilateral pheochromocytomas, cystic and solid tumors of the pancreas, cystadenomas of the epididymis, and endolymphatic sac tumors. The discovery of any of the syndrome components should raise suspicion of this disease and other stigmas must then be investigated. Due to the complexities associated with management of the various VHL manifestation, the diagnosis and the follow-up of this syndrome is a challenge in the clinical practice and a multidisciplinary approach is needed. The particular relevance to endocrinologists is the detection of pheochromocytomas in 35% and islet cell tumors in 17% of VHL patients, which can be associated with hypertension, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and carcinoid syndrome. The purpose of this review is to define the Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome addressing its clinical aspects and classification, the importance of genetic counseling and to propose a protocol for clinical follow-up.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is often deleted or mutated in ccRCC (clear cell renal cell carcinoma) producing a non-functional protein. The gene encodes two mRNA, and three protein isoforms (pVHL<sub>213</sub>, pVHL<sub>160</sub> and pVHL<sub>172</sub>). The pVHL protein is part of an E3 ligase complex involved in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of different proteins, particularly hypoxia inducible factors (HIF) that drive the transcription of genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, angiogenesis or extracellular matrix remodelling. Other non-canonical (HIF-independent) pVHL functions have been described. A recent work reported the expression of the uncharacterized protein isoform pVHL<sub>172</sub> which is translated from the variant 2 by alternative splicing of the exon 2. This splice variant is sometimes enriched in the ccRCCs and the protein has been identified in the respective samples of ccRCCs and different renal cell lines. Functional studies on pVHL have only concerned the pVHL<sub>213</sub> and pVHL<sub>160</sub> isoforms, but no function was assigned to pVHL<sub>172</sub>. Here we show that pVHL<sub>172</sub> stable expression in renal cancer cells does not regulate the level of HIF, exacerbates tumorigenicity when 786-O-pVHL<sub>172</sub> cells were xenografted in mice. The pVHL<sub>172</sub>-induced tumors developed a sarcomatoid phenotype. Moreover, pVHL<sub>172</sub> expression was shown to up regulate a subset of pro-tumorigenic genes including TGFB1, MMP1 and MMP13. In summary we identified that pVHL<sub>172</sub> is not a tumor suppressor. Furthermore our findings suggest an antagonistic function of this pVHL isoform in the HIF-independent aggressiveness of renal tumors compared to pVHL<sub>213</sub>.

N2  - Background: Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CPRCC), a recently recognized, distinct renal neoplasm, composes of cells with clear cytoplasm lining cystic, tubular, and papillary structures. These tumors have immunohistochemical and genetic profiles distinct from clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. Molecular-genetic changes are distinct as well: Alterations of chromosome 3p and the VHL gene are lacking. Although low copy number gains of chromosomes 7 or 17 have been identified in a few tumors, most of these carcinomas do not possess these abnormalities. The comprehensive, characteristic genetic alterations, however, have not yet been identified Design: Three tumors with an original diagnosis of clear cell renal papillary renal cell carcinoma were retrieved from the surgical pathology archives and reviewed. All cases had typical morphology and IHC pattern (CA9+ and CK7+). Microdissection was used in some cases to ensure that at least 20% of the cells were neoplastic. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues by Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Kit. The isolated genomic DNA was subject to targeted sequencing by using Illumina Exome Enrichment & Sequencing Kits. We used Illumina NextSeq 500 system for paired-end (151 bp x 2) sequencing and Illumina on-instrument NextSeq Reporter to generate the variant call format (VCF) files through BWA alignment/mapping and somatic variant caller. By using Illumina VariantStudio, we performed variant filtering, annotation and interpretation with various sources of variant databases. And finally, we focused on variants in most frequently mutated genes associated with RCC from TCGA Results: The WES generated data with mean coverage > 50x and 20,000-30,000 single nucleotide variants (SNV) for each specimen. No recurrent mutation was identified in these tumors. No VHL mutations was identified neither. Interestingly, CCRCC associated gene mutations: SETD2, MAGEC1, BTNL3, NBPF14, TXNIP and PRCC associated gene mutations: SETD2, FAT1 were identified in clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive, molecular evaluation of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma. It seems like that CPRCC is heterogeneous at molecular level. Negative of VHL gene mutation may indicate non-responsive for Anti-VEGF therapy for this tumor. Both CCRCC and PRCC associated gene mutations were also found in clear papillary RCC. This may explain that CPRCC has overlapping features of CCRCC and PRCC at morphological and IHC levels.

N2  - Hypoxic tumor microenvironment makes cancer cells to be therapy-resistant and hypoxia-inducing factors (HIFs) play a central role in hypoxic adaptation. Especially, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is often associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations, leading to up-regulation of HIFs. However, from a different point of view, this suggests the possibility that HIFs could be promising targets in anti-cancer therapy. In this study, we searched for HIF-1alpha-derived peptides that are able to induce RCC-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from HLA-A24<sup>+</sup> RCC patients. Among five peptides derived from HIF-1alpha, which were prepared based on the binding motif to the HLA-A24 allele, a HIF-1alpha<sub>278-287</sub> peptide induced peptide-specific CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HLA-A24<sup>+</sup> RCC patients most effectively. In immunoblot assays, the expression of HIF-1alpha was lowly detected in whole and nuclear lysates of RCC cell lines even under normoxia (20% O<sub>2</sub>), and their expression in whole lysates was increased under hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>). Additionally, HIF-1alpha<sub>278-287</sub> peptide-stimulated T cells showed a higher cytotoxicity against HLA-A24<sup>+</sup> HIF-1alpha-expressing RCC cells than against HLA-A24<sup>-</sup> HIF-1alpha-expressing RCC cells. The cytotoxicity was inhibited by the addition of HIF-1alpha<sub>278-287</sub> peptide-pulsed cold target cells. Altogether, these results indicate that the HIF-1alpha<sub>278-287</sub> peptide could be a candidate for peptide-based anti-cancer vaccines for HLA-A24<sup>+</sup> RCC patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Germline mutations are present in 20-30 per cent of patients with phaeochromocytoma. For patients who develop bilateral disease, complete removal of both adrenal glands (total adrenalectomy) will result in lifelong adrenal insufficiency with an increased risk of death from adrenal crisis. Unilateral/bilateral adrenal-sparing surgery (subtotal adrenalectomy) offers preservation of cortical function and independence from steroids, but leaves the adrenal medulla in situ and thus at risk of developing new and possibly malignant disease. Here, present knowledge about how tumour genotype relates to clinical behaviour is reviewed, and application of this knowledge when choosing the extent of adrenalectomy is discussed.METHODS: A literature review was undertaken of the penetrance of the different genotypes in phaeochromocytomas, the frequency of bilateral disease and malignancy, and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, with emphasis on explaining the clinical phenotypes of phaeochromocytomas and their associated syndromes.RESULTS: Patients with bilateral phaeochromocytomas most often have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) with high-penetrance mutations for benign disease, whereas patients with mutations in the genes encoding SDHB (succinate dehydrogenase subunit B) or MAX (myelocytomatosis viral proto-oncogene homologue-associated factor X) are at increased risk of malignancy.CONCLUSION: Adrenal-sparing surgery should be the standard approach for patients who have already been diagnosed with MEN2 or VHL when operating on the first side, whereas complete removal of the affected adrenal gland(s) is generally recommended for patients with SDHB or MAX germline mutations. Routine assessment of a patient's genotype, even after the first operation, can be crucial for adopting an appropriate strategy for follow-up and future surgery.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most commonly occurring solid cancer of the adult kidney with the majority of RCC cases being detected accidentally. The most aggressive subtype is clear cell RCC (ccRCC). miRNAs, a family of small noncoding RNAs regulating gene expression have been identified as key biological modulators. The von Hippel-Lindau pathway is one of the signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of ccRCC. Another oncogenic mechanism involves the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and serves as a central regulator of cell metabolism, proliferation and survival. Several studies have described the involvement of miRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis and progression of ccRCC. These molecules can be considered as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, allowing response to therapy to be monitored.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene, is a hereditary autosomal-dominant disorder which predisposes the individual to various malignant and benign tumors. VHL acts as a tumor suppressor, mainly through the negative regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors. Moleculartargeted drugs against vascular endothelial growth factor-signaling pathways, a target of hypoxia-inducible factors, have recently been introduced into clinical practice for the treatment of patients with sporadic renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. However, whether such treatments are effective in patients with VHL disease remains to be elucidated. We herein report a Japanese patient with VHL disease who was successfully treated with sunitinib for approximately 5 years. Copyright © 2016 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by multiple benign and malignant tumors including renal cell carcinoma, hemangioblastomas and pheochromocytomas due to double-hit loss of function mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. VHL protein induces degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1a and HIF2a in normal oxygen conditions, preventing HIF-induced angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Mortality is higher in patients with VHL than in the general population and is attributed most often to CNS hemangioblastomas. VHL tumors typically present metachronously, often leading to delayed diagnosis of the syndrome. We report the case a 53-year-old man of Puerto-Rican descent, who presented due to incidentally discovered bilateral heterogeneous adrenal lesions (right, 4.7 cm and left, 1.6 cm) and an enlarged (1.9 cm) right paracaval lymph node on CT urogram done to evaluate hematuria. He had hypertension and diabetes, but was otherwise asymptomatic despite highly elevated urine normetanephrine level (2436 ug/dL; 1090 ug/g creatinine) consistent with pheochromocytoma. He underwent bilateral adrenalectomy with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Pathology confirmed bilateral pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma within the paracaval lymph node. Post-operative urine normetanephrine level was within normal range (363 ug/dL; 259 ug/g creatinine). His diabetes and hypertension resolved after the surgery. He was subsequently found to have a mutation in the VHL gene (Y175C) previously reported in one Spanish family with multiple pheochromocytomas. Based on previously published computational analysis of protein folding energy, this point mutation is predicted to have mild effect on the stability of VHL protein. Clinical subtypes of VHL disease have been defined based on the presence of different tumors, and these correlate with the severity of VHL mutation in regards to its ability to induce HIF degradation. This patient had no evidence of CNS hemangioblastomas or renal cell carcinoma on imaging, consistent with subtype 2C of VHL disease. This case is an example of an atypical presentation of VHL disease which does not strictly fit current diagnostic criteria, and highlights the need for a better understanding of these mutations and perhaps developing a patient-specific screening approach.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is inactivated in the vast majority of human clear cell renal carcinomas. The pathogenesis of VHL loss is currently best understood to occur through stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factors, activation of hypoxia-induced signaling pathways, and transcriptional reprogramming towards a pro-angiogenic and pro-growth state. However, hypoxia also drives other pro-tumorigenic processes, including the development of genomic instability via down-regulation of DNA repair gene expression. Here, we find that DNA repair genes involved in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR) and in mismatch repair, which are down-regulated by hypoxic stress, are decreased in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells relative to wild type VHL-complemented cells. Functionally, this gene repression is associated with impaired DNA double-strand break repair in VHL-deficient cells, as determined by the persistence of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and reduced repair activity in a homology-dependent plasmid reactivation assay. Furthermore, VHL deficiency conferred increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, analogous to the synthetic lethality observed between hypoxia and these agents. Finally, we discovered a correlation between VHL inactivation and reduced HR gene expression in a large panel of human renal carcinoma samples. Together, our data elucidate a novel connection between VHL-deficient renal carcinoma and hypoxia-induced down-regulation of DNA repair, and identify potential opportunities for targeting DNA repair defects in human renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Retinal hemangioblastoma (RH) is a benign vascular tumor frequently associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Tumor growth of RH may lead to deterioration of visual acuity, which can be difficult to treat. Early diagnosis may reduce complication rate and side effects of treatment. The present retrospective study evaluates the long-term follow-up and complications of RH treatment as a function of the therapeutic strategy used.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with RH, followed at Croix Rousse university hospital, Lyon between 2010 and 2017. The following clinical features were recorded : age at diagnosis, presenting symptom, presence of VHL disease, treatments used, post-therapeutic complications and visual outcomes.RESULTS: Seven eyes of five patients were included in our study. Eighty percent of the patients had a mutation in the VHL gene. Four eyes (57%) were treated with laser photocoagulation and three eyes (43%) were treated with cryotherapy. The mean duration of follow-up was 35 months. One of the eyes treated using laser photocoagulation was complicated by an early epiretinal membrane with no visual consequence. Of the eyes treated by cryoapplication, one was complicated by a vitreous hemorrhage, and another by a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, both of which resulted in a decrease in visual acuity.CONCLUSION: The long-term outcome for patients treated for RH was relatively good. Complications were strongly correlated with the initial size of the vascular tumor. Early diagnosis seems to improve visual outcomes. Ophthalmologic monitoring should be part of the systemic, multidisciplinary management.

N2  - Objective: To report on a family with an index patient with variants in FH (FH c.556-4A>G) and VHL (c.342T>C) and further studies to evaluate for pathogenicity. Patients: The index case is a 17 year old female with persistent episodes of high blood pressure. Biochemical evaluation and imaging led to the detection of bilateral pheochromocytoma. Subsequently, analysis of pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes was performed (RET, VHL, NF1, FH, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, TMEM127, MAX). Adrenalectomy was complicated by cardiac decompensation in the context of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. The family history revealed a father with bilateral pheochromocytoma at the age of 13 and a grandfather, who died of an unknown renal disease at the age of 50. There were no reports of hereditary cutaneous or uterine leiomyomas, renal cell cancer, neuroendocrine tumors or hemangioblastomas of the CNS/retina. Further family evaluation revealed clinical and biochemical evidence of (bilateral) pheochromocytoma in two siblings 19 and age 23. Results: Genetic testing of the index case showed germline variants of unknown significance in VHL (c.342T>C) and FH (c.556-4A>G).The FH variant is reported in 9/116704 alleles in the ExAC database, while the variant in VHL is to date unreported. However, a T>A transition at the same nucleotide position has been reported once in 1/121408 alleles (ExAC). No further evidence to classify any variant as pathogenic was available. Further analysis of the germline variants showed that only the VHL variant cosegregated with the phenotype in all available affected family members (n=3) and was negative in 2 unaffected family members. VHL c.342T>C is a synonymous mutation located 2 nucleotides into the second exon, potentially interfering with splicing of the VHL gene transcript. Further evaluations of the VHL gene in tumor DNA showed a reduced, but not entirely absent peak for the T allele, suggesting at least partial loss of heterozygosity. Complete heterozygosity was preserved in germline DNA and DNA obtained from normal tissue from the surgical specimen. Conclusion: The cosegregation of pheochromocytomas and the VHL variant (c.342T>C) suggest pathogenicity. To further evaluate pathogenicity we are currently investigating potential effects on VHL gene transcript splicing. For the time being we recommend further genetic family evaluation and full VHL surveillance in accordance with existing guidelines for the gene carriers. Our report shows the ongoing need for classical genetic evaluation and molecular analysis to interpret the increasing number of variants of unknown significance reported by NGS panels.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is an aggressive tumor with 50% risk of metastases at initial diagnosis or at follow-up. An inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is present in >70% of sporadic cases by two of three different mechanisms: locus deletion, gene mutation, or promoter hypermethylation.OBJECTIVE: To correlate the complete status of the VHL gene with clinical and pathologic criteria.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively included 98 patients with ccRCC who underwent surgery between 2002 and 2005. VHL gene deletions (71 of 98; 72.4%), mutations (68 of 98; 69.4%), and promoter hypermethylations (13 of 98; 13.3%) were screened by gene copy analysis, gene sequencing, and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, respectively.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Relationships between VHL subgroups and the studied criteria were analyzed using chi-square and Student t tests. Survival was analyzed with the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Compared with ccRCCs with two events (66.3%), tumors with no or one genetic event (33.6%) were associated with a higher nuclear grade IV (p=0.02), metastases (p=0.04), sarcomatoid component (p=0.01), dense lymphocyte infiltrate (p=0.013), and vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression (>30%) (p=0.003), which was also an independent factor after multivariate analysis. Furthermore, wild-type VHL tumors (no inactivating event, 11.2%) were associated with nodal involvement (p=0.019), and patients with this type of tumor had a specific survival of 33 mo compared with patients with ccRCCs having one or two VHL inactivating events (107 mo; p=0.016). The retrospective design with small number of wild-type tumors was a limitation of this work.CONCLUSIONS: This long-term study (10-yr clinical follow-up) confirms that ccRCCs with wild-type VHL are highly aggressive tumors that need to be formally identified.PATIENT SUMMARY: Among activated VHL tumors, the wild-type subgroup defines an aggressive phenotype with worse survival rates, suggesting that these tumors must be more thoroughly screened.

N2  - Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor drives the development of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) through hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Although ccRCC cells exhibit constitutive normoxic HIF signaling, the potential role of hypoxia in this setting is not fully understood. We show here that the ccRCC cell lines RCC4 and RCC10, which express mutant versions of VHL, have reduced HIF1alpha expression in hypoxia, whereas HIF2alpha expression is increased or not affected. Similar findings were observed in normoxia after abrogation of prolyl hydroxylase activity by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition, and by siRNA inhibition of mutant VHL. This reduction of HIF1alpha protein is due to proteasome-dependent degradation and is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SART1. HIF1alpha degradation favors ccRCC proliferation, in line with the previously recognized tumor suppressor capability of HIF1alpha. Our data indicate that mutant VHL can protect HIF1alpha from SART1-dependent degradation in normoxic conditions, but this protection is lost in hypoxic settings, favoring hypoxia-dependent ccRCC proliferation. This mechanism of HIF1alpha degradation might operate in some VHL-related clear-cell renal carcinomas in which the deletion of HIF1alpha locus does not occur.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas (PCC) and sympathetic paragangliomas (PGL) are rare neuroendocrine tumors, which derive from chromaffin cells occurring in the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal sympathetic paraganglia. PCC and PGL are often benign, catecholamine-producing tumors, responsible for a myriad of symptoms that may be potentially hazardous to the patient. In contrast, nonsecreting parasympathetic PGL, derived from chief cells, develop mainly in the head and neck region. Although PCC/PGL are more commonly sporadic tumors, germline mutations are present in up to 40% of the patients, ranking these tumors among those with the highest degree of heritability. PCC/PGL are associated with a variety of hereditary syndromes, comprising genetic alterations in RET, NF1, VHL, and SDHx genes, the last 2 being involved in regulating the hypoxia pathway. Additional hypoxia pathway-related genes have been recently associated with PCC/PGL development, namely EGLN1 and EPAS1. Thus, dysregulation of the hypoxia pathway seems to play a major role in PCC/PGL development, in particular through the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors and the appearance of a pseudohypoxia signature. This article is focused on reviewing the tumorigenic mechanisms resultant from VHL, SDHx, EGLN1, and EPAS1 mutations, as well as the associated tumors, namely PCC/PGL, and extra manifestations such as polycythemia. In the light of the recent discoveries, hypoxia pathway molecules appear as key players in PCC/PGL development. Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

    Paper in German
N2  - Renal cell carcinomas are associated with hereditary tumor syndromes in approximately 5% of cases. In patients with a hereditary predisposition, tumors show an earlier age of onset, often with a multicentric and bilateral manifestation. While some patients with renal cell carcinoma can be classified into well-characterized kidney cancer syndromes others have a genetic background which is still poorly understood. Most of the specific tumor syndromes are associated with a histopathologically distinct renal cell tumor phenotype. The recognition of patients with hereditary renal cell carcinoma and the identification of individual family members with a higher risk of development of renal tumors is important for early tumor detection and treatment. This manuscript reviews the clinical pathological and molecular findings of hereditary renal cell carcinoma syndromes.

N2  - We describe herein compound 1, which is similar to many known natural products, as an inhibitor of the VHL-HIF1alpha interaction via structure-based virtual screening. Compound 1 disrupts VHL-mediated HIF1alpha degradation, leading to significantly increased VEGF expression. To our knowledge, compound 1 is a member of only the second class of small molecule inhibitors of the VHL-HIF1alpha interaction.

N2  - Background: Aristolochia species used in the practice of traditional herbal medicine contains aristolochic acid (AA), an establishedhuman carcinogen contributing to urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract. AA binds covalently to genomic DNA, forming aristolactam (AL)-DNA adducts. Here we investigated whether AA is also an etiologic factor in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study to investigate the linkage between Aristolochia prescription history, cumulative AA consumption, and ccRCC incidence in Taiwan (5,709 cases and 22,836 matched controls). The presence and level of mutagenic dA-AL-I adducts were determined in the kidney DNA of 51 Taiwanese ccRCC patients. The whole-exome sequences of ccRCC tumors from 10 Taiwanese ccRCC patients with prior exposure to AA were determined. Results: Cumulative ingestion of more than 250 mg of AA increased risk of ccRCC (OR, 1.25), and we detected dA-AL-I adducts in 76% of Taiwanese ccRCC patients. Furthermore, the distinctive AA mutational signature was evident in six of 10 sequenced ccRCC exomes from Taiwanese patients. Conclusions: This study strongly suggests that AA contributes to the etiology of certain RCCs. Impact: The current study offers compelling evidence implicating AA in a significant fraction of the RCC arising in Taiwan and illustrates the power of integrating epidemiologic, molecular, and genetic data in the investigation of cancer etiology.

N2  - Purpose To establish prognostic genomic biomarkers for patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Materials and methods We identified 60 patients who presented with metastatic ccRCC at our institution between 2001 and 2015 and had genomic sequencing on their primary tumor. We pooled these patients with 107 other patients with the same inclusion criteria from three well-known public databases. Five commonly mutated genes were chosen for analysis: VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, and KDM5C. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used for comparisons between groups. Results Median OS in the cohort was 2.5 years. Higher Fuhrman grade was associated with decreased median OS (P<0.001). Mutations in SETD2 (P = 0.027) and KDM5C (P = 0.019) were associated with reduced risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58 [95% CI: 0.35-0.94] and HR = 0.43 [95% CI: 0.22-0.85], respectively). BAP1 mutations (P = 0.008) were associated with increased risk of death (HR = 1.81 [95% CI: 1.16-2.83]). There were significantly more female patients with a BAP1 mutation than females in the overall cohort (P = 0.001). Conclusions Mutations in BAP1 negatively affected OS, whereas SETD2 and KDM5C mutations were associated with prolonged OS in our pooled cohort of 167 patients with metastatic ccRCC. Our results expand upon efforts at understanding genomic biomarkers in localized disease. Those efforts set the stage for our novel investigation examining associations of select recurrent somatic mutations in stage IV patients with ccRCC. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N1  - 45 individuals from 24 families --&gt; unable to access individual patient characteristics
N2  - Heterozygous whole gene deletions (WGDs), and intragenic microdeletions, account for a significant proportion of mutations underlying cancer predisposition syndromes. We analyzed the frequency and genotype-phenotype correlations of microdeletions in 12 genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, NF1, NF2, APC, PTCH1, and VHL) representing seven tumor predisposition syndromes in 5,897 individuals (2,611 families) from our center. Overall, microdeletions accounted for 14% of identified mutations. As expected, smaller deletions or duplications were more common (12%) than WGDs (2.2%). Where a WGD was identified in the germline in NF2, the mechanism of somatic second hit was not deletion, as previously described for NF1. For neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2, we compared the mechanism of germline deletion. Unlike NF1, where three specific deletion sizes account for most germline WGDs, NF2 deletion breakpoints were different across seven samples tested. One of these deletions was 3.93 Mb and conferred a severe phenotype, thus refining the region for a potential NF2 modifier gene to a 2.04-Mb region on chromosome 22. The milder phenotype of NF2 WGDs may be due to the apparent absence of chromosome 22 loss as the second hit. These observations of WGD phenotypes will be helpful for interpreting incidental findings from microarray analysis and next-generation sequencing. Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background:Paragangliomas (PGL) can present in four ways, in descending order of frequency: mass effect, catecholamine hypersecretion, incidentaloma, or asymptomatic genetic screening. Only a few present w/ both catecholamine hypersecretion & serious sequlae of mass effect of primary or metastatic lesion of malignant PGL; herein we describe such a case who presented w/ spinal cord compression, had posed life threatening challenge due to catecholamine hypersecretion (Urinary normetanephrine levels were >70x upper limit of normal ) w/ normal metanephrines, because the enzyme phenylethanolamine Nmethyltransferase (PNMT), w/c converts norepinephrine to epinephrine, requires cortisol as cofactor is absent in PGL. Clinical case:A 39 y/o man presented w/ hypertensive crisis BP 210/140, tachycardia (140 bpm), hyperglycemia (glucose 25 mmol/l), hypovolemia & catecholamine cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 30%) w/ abnormal urine normetanephrine (252umol/l:RR 0-3.4). Emergency resuscitation measures included control of HTN using initially Phenoxybenzamine followed by Labetolol, & subsequently metyrosine was used, correction of volume contraction & hyperglycemia w/ IV insulin. Imaging studies: CT/PET-CT/MRI/MIBG & Octreoscan: 12x9 cm hypermetabolic, octreotide +ve, MIBG +ve left para-adrenal mass, w/ extensive disseminated metastases involving intrathoracic, abdominal lymph nodes, & bones (including most of thoracolumbar vertebrae, large lytic lesion lesion L3, w/ spinal canal & nerve rootlets compression. Serum CGA was 3,916 ng/ml (RR: < 93) Clinical Course: Relief of severe constant radicular pain from critical spinal metastases required round the clock IV morphine > 8 mg/h, gabapentin & Tramadalol. Mgmt of spinal mets took precedence & I 131-MIBG was administered, w/ the concern that avid uptake of http:// MIBG could result in tumor expansion/necrosis w/ worsening cord compression & release of preformed catecholamine could aggravate HTN & cardiomyopathy; hence we used dexamethasone, & metyrosine pre MIBG Rx. This resulted in a dramatic pain control that enabled complete weaning off all analgesics within 4 days. This was followed by octreotide & targeted XRT. Management of primary PGL, consisted of preoperative tumor embolization; however at surgery tumor was inoperable, only liver Bx was done that revealed metastatic PGL w/ +ve immunostains for CGA, & synaptophysin. Pt. is alive. PRRT is planned. Genetic analysis: SDHBand VHL gene studies are awaited; multiexon analysis for RET oncogene mutation was negative. Conclusion: Intraabdominal functional sympathetic malignant paragangliomas can rarely present with severe symptomatic spinal cord & nerve rootlets compression from spinal metastases as well as exorbitant catecholamine hypersecretion resulting in malignant NTH, severe hyperglycemia, & cardiomyopathy. Management of such cases is both challenging & rewarding.

N2  - Most genetic disorders are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field and is providing rapidly growing insights into the pathomechanism of hereditary nephropathies. Current best-practice guidelines for most hereditary nephropathies include genetic diagnostics. The increasing number of genes that have to be considered in patients with hereditary nephropathies is often challenging when addressed by conventional techniques and largely benefits from NGS-based approaches that allow the parallel analysis of all disease genes in a single test at relatively low cost, e.g., by the use of multi-gene panels. Knowledge of the underlying genotype is of advantage in discussions with regard to transplantation and therapeutic options. Further, genetics may aid the early detection and treatment of renal and extrarenal complications and the reduction of invasive procedures. An accurate genetic diagnosis is crucial for genetic counselling, provides information about the recurrence risk and may help to improve the clinical management of patients and their families. The bottleneck in genetics is no longer the primary wet lab process but the interpretation of the obtained genetic data, which is by far the most challenging and work-intensive part of the analysis. This can only be managed in a multidisciplinary setting that brings together expert knowledge in genetics and the respective medical field. In the future, bench and bedside benefits can be expected from this kind of digitized medicine. Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The majority of kidney cancers are associated with mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau gene and a small proportion are associated with infrequent mutations in other well characterized tumour-suppressor genes. In the past 15 years, efforts to uncover other key genes involved in renal cancer have identified many genes that are dysregulated or silenced via epigenetic mechanisms, mainly through methylation of promoter CpG islands or dysregulation of specific microRNAs. In addition, the advent of next-generation sequencing has led to the identification of several novel genes that are mutated in renal cancer, such as PBRM1, BAP1 and SETD2, which are all involved in histone modification and nucleosome and chromatin remodelling. In this Review, we discuss how altered DNA methylation, microRNA dysregulation and mutations in histone-modifying enzymes disrupt cellular pathways in renal cancers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hemangioblastomas usually occur in the cerebellum, and are often a component of the von Hippel-Lindau disease. Edema-like changes along the optic tract are commonly observed in association with tumors in the sellar and suprasellar regions, such as craniopharyngiomas and pituitary adenomas. Here, we describe a case of sporadic suprasellar hemangioblastoma with edema-like changes along the optic tract that completely resolved after surgery CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 28-year-old woman with failing vision and a bitemporal hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor which was accompanied by a 10 mm cyst. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery axial MRI revealed a hyperintense region along the optic tract. Other regions of the central nervous system were normal. Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery was performed and the histopathologic findings confirmed hemangioblastoma. Six months after surgery, the edema-like change along the optic tract had disappeared, and the patient is doing well without pituitary insufficiency, pituitary hormone medications, or signs of tumor recurrence. In addition, the genetic test was negative for VHL mutations.CONCLUSIONS: When examining a patient with suprasellar tumor, clinicians must consider the possibility of hemangioblastoma, and adequate treatment can improve the edematous change and visual disturbance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although many studies have been published about specific lesions characterizing von Hippel-Lindau(VHL) disease, none have dealt with the natural history of the whole disease and the consequent disabilities. We aim to define the comprehensive natural history of VHL disease and to describe the functional disabilities and their impact upon patients' quality of life, thereby tailoring the follow-up schedule accordingly.METHODS: We performed a prospective analysis on 128 VHL-affected patients beginning in 1996. For each affected organ, we defined intervals between the first and subsequent VHL-related manifestations and compared them with current VHL surveillance protocols. We looked for any association of the number of involved organs with age, sex, type of VHL gene mutation, and functional domain mutation. Ultimately, we assessed the organ-specific disabilities caused by VHL disease.RESULTS: Hemangioblastomas show different patterns of progression depending on their location, whereas both renal cysts and carcinomas have similar progression rates. Surgery for pheochromocytoma and CNS hemangioblastoma is performed earlier than for pancreatic or renal cancer. The number of involved organs is associated with age but not with sex, type of VHL gene mutation, or functional domain mutation. A thorough analysis of functional disabilities showed that age is related to the first-appearing functional impairment, but it is not predictive of the final number of disabilities.CONCLUSIONS: Our study defines the disease progression and provides a comprehensive view of the syndrome over time. We analyzed for the first time the functional disability of VHL patients, assessing the progression for each function.

N2  - Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) are large dynamic multi-subunit complexes that control the fate of many proteins in cells. CRLs are attractive drug targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors and chemical inducers of protein degradation. Herein we describe a structure-guided biophysical approach to probe the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the Cullin-2 scaffold protein and the adaptor subunits Elongin BC within the context of the von Hippel-Lindau complex (CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> ) using peptides. Two peptides were shown to bind at the targeted binding site on Elongin C, named the "EloC site", with micromolar dissociation constants, providing a starting point for future optimization. Our results suggest ligandability of the EloC binding site to short linear peptides, unveiling the opportunity and challenges to develop small molecules that have the potential to target selectively the Cul2-adaptor PPI within CRLs.

N2  - Loss of von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein function is a key driver of VHL diseases, including sporadic and inherited clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Modulation of the proteostasis of VHL, especially missense point-mutated VHL, is a promising approach to augmenting VHL levels and function. VHL proteostasis is regulated by multiple mechanisms including folding, chaperone binding, complex formation and phosphorylation. Nevertheless, many details underlying the regulations of VHL proteostasis are unknown. VHL is expressed as two variants, VHL30 and VHL19. Furthermore, the long-form variant of VHL was often detected as multiple bands by western blotting. However, how these multiple species of VHL are generated and whether the process regulates VHL proteostasis and function are unknown. We hypothesized that the two major species are generated by VHL protein cleavage, and the cleavage regulates VHL proteostasis and subsequent function. We characterized VHL species using genetical and pharmacological approaches and showed that VHL was first cleaved at the N-terminus by chymotrypsin C before being directed for proteasomal degradation. Casein kinase 2-mediated phosphorylation at VHL N-terminus was required for the cleavage. Furthermore, inhibition of cleavage stabilized VHL protein and thereby promoted HIF downregulation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism regulating VHL proteostasis and function, which is significant for identifying new drug targets and developing new therapeutic approaches targeting VHL deficiency in VHL diseases.

N2  - Aim: We aimed at exploring the activation pattern of the mTOR pathway in sporadic and hereditary pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs). Methods: A total of 178 PCCs and 44 PGLs, already characterized for the presence of germline mutations in VHL, RET, NF1, MAX, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD as well as somatic mutations in VHL, RET, H-RAS, and MAX, were included in 5 tissue microarrays and tested using immunohistochemistry for mTOR and Rictor as well as the phosphorylated forms of mTOR, p70S6K, AMPK, AKT, 4EBP1, S6, and Raptor. Results: The positive correlation among most of the molecules investigated proved the functional activation of the mTOR pathway in PCCs/PGLs. Total mTOR, p-S6K and p-S6, and mTORC1-associated molecules p-Raptor and p-AMPK were all significantly overexpressed in PGLs rather than in PCCs, and in the head and neck rather than in abdominal locations. None of the markers, except for the low expression of p-mTOR, was associated with malignancy. Cluster 1 PCCs/PGLs had higher total mTOR, p-Raptor, and p-S6 expression than cluster 2 PCCs/PGLs. In contrast, p-mTOR and mTORC2-associated molecule Rictor were significantly overexpressed in cluster 2 tumors. Within cluster 1, molecules active in the mTORC1 complex were significantly overexpressed in SDHX- as compared to VHL-mutated tumors. Conclusion: In summary, the mTOR pathway is activated in a high proportion of PCCs/PGLs, with a preferential overactivation of the mTORC1 complex in PGLs of the head and neck and/or harboring SDHX mutations.

N2  - Objective There are currently no good histological or molecular markers to differentiate benign from malignant phaeochromocytomas and paraganglinomas (PPGLs). Our previous cross-sectional study observed that ERBB-2 overexpression was associated with malignant PPGLs. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of ERBB-2 overexpression for metastasis in PPGLs in a large population. Methods A total of 262 patients diagnosed as PPGLs in our institution between 2002 and 2012 were included. We analysed ERBB-2 protein expression in the primary PPGL tumours by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ERBB-2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Direct Sanger sequencing was performed to examine ERBB-2 exon 20 mutations. The occurrence of malignant PPGLs was documented in the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between ERBB-2 overexpression and metastasis of PPGLs. Results Twenty-six (9.9%) patients had ERBB-2 overexpression in their primary PPGL tumours, which was significantly associated with ERBB-2 amplification (17/25, 68%). No ERBB-2 mutation was found. At a median follow-up of 4.5 years, a total of 23 malignant PPGLs were documented, including eight (30.8%) patients in the ERBB-2 overexpression group and 15 (6.4%) patients in the ERBB-2-negative group. The incidence rate of metastasis was 5.3 per 100 person-years vs 1.4 per 100 person-years in the ERBB-2 overexpression and ERBB-2-negative groups (P < 0.001), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that ERBB-2 overexpression was associated with decreased metastasis-free survival (P = 0.001, log-rank test). After adjusting for primary tumour size and location, Cox regression analysis revealed that ERBB-2 overexpression was independently associated with risk of malignant PPGLs (HR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.12-6.90; P = 0.028). Conclusion Patients harbouring tumours with ERBB-2 overexpression have a significantly higher risk of developing malignant PPGLs. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - It is now understood that specific somatic and germline mutations may lead to the development of the neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). NETs usually occur as sporadic isolated tumours, although they also may present as part of complex familial endocrine cancer syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and type 2 (MEN2), Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and neurofibromatosis syndromes, tuberous sclerosis, Carney triad and dyad, Reed syndrome and polycythaemia-paraganglioma syndromes. Only in MEN2 syndrome is there a specific genotype-phenotype correlation, although in both sporadic and syndromic NETs some gene mutations are associated with specific clinico-pathological features and prognosis. There have been several advances in our understanding of the NETs leading to earlier detection and targeted therapeutic treatment, but given the poor prognosis associated with metastatic NETs, it will be necessary to find new biomarkers for the prediction of malignant potential and to find novel therapeutic targets for NETs.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors known to produce and secrete high levels of circulating catecholamines and their metabolites. The biochemical characteristics of these tumors can be used to divide them into three major phenotypes. The adrenergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic phenotypes are defined by predominant elevations in epinephrine and metanephrine, norepinephrine and normetanephrine, and dopamine and 3-methoxytyramine, respectively. There are over 15 well-identified tumor-susceptibility genes responsible for approximately 40% of the cases. The objective of this review article is to outline specific genotype/biochemical phenotype relationships.METHODS: Literature review.RESULTS: None.CONCLUSION: Biochemical phenotype of PPGL is determined by the underlying genetic mutation and the associated molecular pathway. Identification of genotype/biochemical relationships is valuable in prioritizing testing for specific genes, making treatment decisions and monitoring disease progression.ABBREVIATIONS: 3-MT = 3-methoxytyramine; EPAS1 = endothelial pas domain protein 1; FH = fumarate hydratase; HIF2A = hypoxia inducible factor type 2A; MEN2 = multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2; NF1 = neurofibromatosis type 1; PNMT = phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; PPGL = pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma; RET = rearranged during transfection; SDH = succinate dehydrogenase; SDHAF2 = succinate dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2; TCA = tricarboxylic acid; TH = tyrosine hydroxylase; TMEM127 = transmembrane protein 127; VHL = von Hippel-Lindau.

N2  - Numerous mutations of the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene have been reported to cause dysfunction of VHL protein (pVHL) and lead to processes related to tumor progression. pVHL acts as an E3 ligase and degrades downstream targets, such as hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) which is essential for tumor growth. Previous studies reported reduction of VHL protein, rather than mRNA in VHL-related tumor patients, suggesting that instability of the pVHL protein itself is a primary cause of dysfunction. Regulation of pVHL stability has therefore been a major focus of research. We report that ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X), which is a deubiquitinase binds and promotes degradation of both wild-type and mutants of pVHL that retain E3 ligase function, thus activating the HIF pathway. USP9X degrades pVHL through protection of its substrate, the newly identified pVHL E3 ligase Smurf1. In addition, USP9X activates glycolysis and promotes cell proliferation through pVHL. Treatment with a USP9X inhibitor shows an effect similar to USP9X knockdown in pVHL induction, and suppresses HIF activity. Our findings demonstrate that USP9X is a novel regulator of pVHL stability, and USP9X may be a therapeutic target for treatment of VHL-related tumors.

N2  - Retinal hemangioblastomas are highly vascular benign tumors that can be encountered either sporadically or within the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. We report a case of a VHL patient with retinal hemangioblastoma who underwent PET/CT scans using F-FDG and Ga-DOTATATE. The tumor showed low-level F-FDG and increased Ga-DOTATATE activity, suggesting cell-surface overexpression of somatostatin receptors. The presented case indicates the clinical applications of somatostatin receptor imaging with Ga-DOTA-conjugated peptides in detection and follow-up of VHL manifestations, screening of asymptomatic gene carriers, and in diagnosis of sporadic retinal hemangioblastomas, which may have similar features on MRI with other retinal tumors.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for ~80% of all RCC, and biallelic Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene defects occur in ~75% of sporadic ccRCC. The etiopathogenesis of VHL mutant metastatic RCC, based on our understanding to date of molecular mechanisms involved, is a sequence of events which can be grouped under the following: (i) loss of VHL activity (germline/somatic mutation + inactivation of the wild-type copy); (ii) constitutive activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway due to loss of VHL activity and transcription of genes involved in angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, survival, anaerobic glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway; (iii) interactions of the HIF pathway with other oncogenic pathways; (iv) genome-wide epigenetic changes (potentially driven by an overactive HIF pathway) and the influence of epigenetics on various oncogenic, apoptotic, cell cycle regulatory and mismatch repair pathways (inhibition of multiple tumor suppressor genes); (v) immune evasion, at least partially caused by changes in the epigenome. These mechanisms interact throughout the pathogenesis and progression of disease, and also confer chemoresistance and radioresistance, making it one of the most difficult metastatic cancers to treat. This article puts together the sequential pathogenesis of VHL mutant ccRCC by elaborating these mechanisms and the interplay of oncogenic pathways, epigenetics, metabolism and immune evasion, with a perspective on potential therapeutic strategies. We reflect on the huge gap between our understanding of the molecular biology and currently accepted standard of care in metastatic ccRCC, and present ideas for better translational research involving therapeutic strategies with combinatorial drug approach, targeting different aspects of the pathogenesis.

N2  - Elevated IGF-1/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) autocrine/paracrine signaling in patients with renal cell carcinoma is associated with poor prognosis of the disease independent of their von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) status. Increased expression of IGF-1R in renal cancer cells correlates with their potency of tumor development and progression. The mechanism by which expression of IGF-1R is increased in renal carcinoma is not known. We report that VHL-deficient and VHL-positive renal cancer cells possess significantly decreased levels of mature, pre-, and pri-miR-214 than normal proximal tubular epithelial cells. We identified an miR-214 recognition element in the 3'UTR of IGF-1R mRNA and confirmed its responsiveness to miR-214. Overexpression of miR-214 decreased the IGF-1R protein levels, resulting in the inhibition of Akt kinase activity in both types of renal cancer cells. IGF-1 provoked phosphorylation and inactivation of PRAS40 in an Akt-dependent manner, leading to the activation of mTORC1 signal transduction to increase phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4EBP-1. Phosphorylation-deficient mutants of PRAS40 and 4EBP-1 significantly inhibited IGF-1R-driven proliferation of renal cancer cells. Expression of miR-214 suppressed IGF-1R-induced phosphorylation of PRAS40, S6 kinase, and 4EBP-1, indicating inhibition of mTORC1 activity. Finally, miR-214 significantly blocked IGF-1R-forced renal cancer cell proliferation, which was reversed by expression of 3'UTR-less IGF-1R and constitutively active mTORC1. Together, our results identify a reciprocal regulation of IGF-1R levels and miR-214 expression in renal cancer cells independent of VHL status. Our data provide evidence for a novel mechanism for IGF-1R-driven renal cancer cell proliferation involving miR-214 and mTORC1.

N2  - Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is a highly aggressive small round celltumor but is extremely rare in the lung. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to breakthroughs for genetic analyses and personalizedmedicine approaches for cancer treatment.We report the case of a 30-year-old woman with an advanced pulmonary PNET treated with multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, and achieved a partial response (PR) as a best response. However, there was a disease progression after these treatment regimens.The NGS revealed the presence of a copy number loss (CNL) of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), CDKN2A/B and TP53 genes. The specific VHL CNL has not previously been associated with PNET, but has been reported in other tumors and has been associated with response to Sunitinib. Sunitinibwas then instituted for this patient and resulted in PR after the failure of multiple chemotherapeutic regimens. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pulmonary PNET with CNL of VHL gene that benefits from Sunitinib treatment. This case illustrates the potential of clinicalNGS to open unexpected avenues for treatment and thereby improve patient outcomes.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is a hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome that places affected individuals at risk for multiple tumors, which are predominantly benign and generally occur in the central nervous system or abdomen. Although the majority of tumors occur in adults, children and adolescents with the condition develop a significant proportion of vHL manifestations and are vulnerable to delayed tumor detection and their sequelae. Although multiple tumor screening paradigms are currently being utilized for patients with vHL, surveillance should be reassessed as the available relevant clinical information continues to expand. We propose a new vHL screening paradigm similar to existing approaches, with important modifications for some tumor types, placing an emphasis on risks in childhood. This includes advancement in the timing of surveillance initiation and increased frequency of screening evaluations. Another neuroendocrine-related familial condition is the rapidly expanding hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma syndrome (HPP). The tumor spectrum for patients with HPP syndrome includes paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, renal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The majority of patients with HPP syndrome harbor an underlying variant in one of the SHDx genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHA, and SDHAF2), although other genes also have been described (MAX and TMEM127). Annual screening for elevated plasma or urine markers along with complete blood count and biennial whole-body MRI accompanied by focal neck MRI is recommended for older children and adults with HPP syndrome to detect tumors early and to decrease morbidity and mortality from HPP-related tumors.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) frequently exhibit inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor gene, VHL, and often harbor multiple copy-number alterations in genes that regulate cell cycle progression. We show here that modeling these genetic alterations by combined deletion of Vhl, Trp53 and Rb1 specifically in renal epithelial cells in mice caused ccRCC. These tumors arose from proximal tubule epithelial cells and shared molecular markers and mRNA expression profiles with human ccRCC. Exome sequencing revealed that mouse and human ccRCCs exhibit recurrent mutations in genes associated with the primary cilium, uncovering a mutational convergence on this organelle and implicating a subset of ccRCCs as genetic ciliopathies. Different mouse tumors responded differently to standard therapies for advanced human ccRCC, mimicking the range of clinical behaviors in the human disease. Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-alpha transcription factors with acriflavine as third-line therapy had therapeutic effects in some tumors, providing preclinical evidence for further investigation of HIF-alpha inhibition as a ccRCC treatment. This autochthonous mouse ccRCC model represents a tool to investigate the biology of ccRCC and to identify new treatment strategies. Copyright © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Germline inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor predisposes patients to develop different highly vascularized cancers. pVHL targets the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha) for degradation, modulating the activation of various genes involved in hypoxia response. Hypoxia plays a relevant role in regulating cell cycle progression, inducing growth arrest in cells exposed to prolonged oxygen deprivation. However, the exact molecular details driving this transition are far from understood. Here, we present novel interactions between pVHL and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor family CDKN1 (p21, p27 and p57). Bioinformatics analysis, yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to predict, dissect and validate the interactions. We found that the CDKN1 proteins share a conserved region mimicking the HIF-1alpha motif responsible for pVHL binding. Intriguingly, a p27 site-specific mutation associated to cancer is shown to modulate this novel interaction. Our findings suggest a new connection between the pathways regulating hypoxia and cell cycle progression.

N2  - Introduction: Optimal clinical assessment and subsequent followup of patients with or suspected of having a hereditary renal cell carcinoma syndrome (hRCC) is not standardized and practice varies widely. We propose protocols to optimize these processes in patients with hRCC to encourage a more uniform approach to management that can then be evaluated. Methods: A review of the literature, including existing guidelines, was carried out for the years 1985?2015. Expert consensus was used to define recommendations for initial assessment and followup. Results: Recommendations for newly diagnosed patients' assessment and optimal ages to initiate followup protocols for von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL), hereditary papillary renal cancer (HPRC), hereditary leiomyomatosis with renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD), familial paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndromes (PGL-PCC), and tuberous sclerosis (TSC) are proposed. Conclusions: Our proposed consensus for structured assessment and followup is intended as a roadmap for the care of patients with hRCC to guide healthcare providers. Although the list of syndromes included is not exhaustive, the document serves as a starting point for future updates. Copyright © 2016 Canadian Urological Association.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) is a rare type of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) originating from the renal medulla. Clinical outcomes are poor, and there are no consensus guidelines to guide therapy.OBJECTIVE: To determine genomic alterations (GAs) in a series of patients with locally advanced or metastatic CDC for whom genomic profiling was performed during the course of clinical care.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks or slides were obtained for 17 patients with CDC. DNA was extracted and comprehensive genomic profiling was performed in a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Bayesian algorithms and local alignment algorithms were used to detect substitutions and insertions/deletions, respectively. A comparison to normal control samples was used to detect copy number alterations. Clinically relevant GAs (CRGAs) were defined as those linked to approved or investigational targeted therapies.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The median age in the cohort was 53 yr (range 26-73), and 14 primary tumors and three metastatic sites assessed. A total of 36 GAs were detected in this series of patients, with an average of 2.1 GAs per case. The most common GAs were in NF2 (5/17, 29%), SETD2 (4/17, 24%), SMARCB1 (3/17, 18%), and CDKN2A (2/17, 12%). Of nine cases assessed for FH GAs, two patients had FH homozygous loss. A limitation is that targeted interrogation of genes known to be implicated in other cancers was performed, so mutations outside of these cannot be excluded.CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent CRGAs were detected in this series of CDC cases and suggest a possible benefit from targeted therapy. In particular, mTOR inhibitors may be of interest in patients with NF2 alterations. Alterations in FH and SMARCB1 also occurred in a mutually exclusive manner to NF2 alterations.PATIENT SUMMARY: This report provides important genomic insights into collecting duct carcinoma, a rare type of renal cell carcinoma with a very aggressive course. These insights could further rationalize the use of targeted therapies for rare tumors according to the individual genomic alterations harbored.

N2  - Kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), is a disease of increasing incidence that commonly is seen in the general practice of nephrology. Despite this state of affairs, this fascinating and highly morbid disease frequently is under-represented, or even absent, from the curriculum of nephrologists in training and generally is underemphasized in national nephrology meetings, both scientific as well as clinical. Although classic concepts in cancer research in general had led to the concept that cancer is a disease resulting from mutations in the control of growth-regulating pathways, reinforced by the discovery of oncogenes, more contemporary research, particularly in kidney cancer, has uncovered changes in metabolic pathways mediated by those same genes that control tumor energetics and biosynthesis. This adaptation of classic biochemical pathways to the tumor's advantage has been labeled metabolic reprogramming. For example, in the case of kidney cancer there exists a near-universal presence of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) inactivation in the most common form, clear cell RCC (ccRCC), leading to activation of hypoxia-relevant and other metabolic pathways. Studies of this and other pathways in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) have been particularly revealing, leading to the concept that ccRCC can itself be considered a metabolic disease. For this reason, the relatively new method of metabolomics has become a useful technique in the study of ccRCC to tease out those pathways that have been reprogrammed by the tumor to its maximum survival advantage. Furthermore, identification of the nodes of such pathways can lead to novel areas for drug intervention in a disease for which such targets are seriously lacking. Further research and dissemination of these concepts, likely using omics techniques, will lead to clinical trials of therapeutics specifically targeted to tumor metabolism, rather than those generally toxic to all proliferating cells. Such novel agents are highly likely to be more effective than existing drugs and to have far fewer adverse effects. This review provides a general overview of the technique of metabolomics and then discusses how it and other omics techniques have been used to further our understanding of the basic biology of kidney cancer as well as to identify new therapeutic approaches.

N2  - Precision therapy for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) requires molecular biomarkers ascertaining disease prognosis. In this study, we performed integrated proteomic and transcriptomic screening in all four tumour-node-metastasis stages of ccRCC and adjacent normal tissues (n = 18) to investigate differentially expressed genes. Most identified differentially expressed genes revealed a strong association with transforming growth factor-beta level and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process. Of them, Serpin peptidase inhibitor clade H member 1 (SERPINH1) revealed the strongest association with poor prognosis and regulation on the expression levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Subsequently, two independent sets (n = 532 and 105) verified the high level of SERPINH1 in ccRCC tissues and its association with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in all tumour-node-metastasis stages and patients with von Hippel-Lindau wild-type (VHL-WT). SERPINH1 was an independent predictor of poor overall survival (hazard ratio 0.696 for all patients) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.433 for all patients and 0.362 for patients with VHL-WT) in ccRCC. We have thus shown for the first time that SERPINH1 is an independent precision predictor for unfavourable prognosis in ccRCC. This could assist in identifying patients who need early aggressive management and deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of VHL-WT ccRCC.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are the most common renal neoplasia and can be divided into three main histologic subtypes, among which clear cell RCC is by far the most common form of kidney cancer. Despite substantial advances over the last decade in the understanding of RCC biology, surgical treatments, and targeted and immuno-therapies in the metastatic setting, the prognosis for advanced RCC patients remains poor. One of the major problems with RCC treatment strategies is inherent or acquired resistance towards therapeutic agents over time. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs that play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation, has added new dimensions to the development of novel diagnostic and treatment tools. Because of an association between Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) genes with chromosomal loss in 3p25-26 and clear cell RCC, miRNAs have attracted considerable scientific interest over the last years. The loss of VHL function leads to constitutional activation of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway and to consequent expression of numerous angiogenic and carcinogenic factors. Since miRNAs represent key players of carcinogenesis, tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, as well as in development of metastases in RCC, they might serve as potential therapeutic targets. Several miRNAs are already known to be dysregulated in RCC and have been linked to biological processes involved in tumor angiogenesis and response to anti-cancer therapies. This review summarizes the role of different miRNAs in RCC angiogenesis and their association with the VHL gene, highlighting their potential role as novel drug targets.

N2  - Von Hipple-Lindau (vHL) is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes individuals to an increased risk of developing multi-organ neoplasms. Pancreatic involvement with subsequent development of type II diabetes mellitus is a well-documented complication of this disorder. In this case report, we present a case of a young man who presented with primary symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. Patient was later found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis and upon further investigation, was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type I. Patient's history of persistent abdominal pain prompted further imaging studies, which demonstrated a left sided pheochromocytoma and right sided renal cell carcinoma. Genetic studies confirmed presence of 384delT frame-shift mutation in exon 2 of the tumor suppressor, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, vHL gene. This case report represents the only one in literature with a rare association of vHL and islet cell autoantibody positive, type I diabetes mellitus. Copyright © J PIONEER MED SCI.

N2  - Background/Aim: Germline mutations in any of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes result in destabilization of the SDH protein complex and loss of SDHB expression at immunohistochemistry. SDHA is lost together with SDHB in SDHA-mutated tumours, but its expression is retained in tumours with other SDH mutations. We investigated whether SDHA/SDHB immunohistochemistry is able to identify SDH-related tumours in a retrospective case series of phaeochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs). Materials and Methods: SDHA and SDHB immunostaining was performed in 13 SDH genemutated tumours (SDHB: n=3; SDHC: n=1; SDHD: n=9) and 16 wild-type tumours. Protein expression by western blot analysis and enzymatic activity were also assessed. Results: Tumours harbouring SDH gene mutations demonstrated a significant reduction in enzymatic activity and protein expression when compared to wild-type tumours. SDHB immunostaining detected 76.9% of SDH mutated PCCs/PGLs (3/3 SDHB-mutated samples; 1/1 SDHCmutated sample; 6/9 SDHD-mutated samples). In three SDHD-related tumours with the same mutation (p.Pro81Leu), positive (n=2) or weakly diffuse (n=1) SDHB staining was observed. All wild-type PCCs/PGLs exhibited SDHB immunoreactivity, while immunostaining for SDHA was positive in 93.8% cases and weakly diffuse in one (6.2%). SDHA protein expression was preserved in all tumours with mutations. Conclusion: SDHA and SDHB immunohistochemistry should be interpreted with caution, due to possible false-positive or false-negative results, and ideally in the setting of quality assurance provided by molecular testing. In SDHD mutation, weak non-specific cytoplasmic staining occurs commonly, and this pattern of staining can be difficult to interpret with certainty.

N2  - In the Greek language, Phakos means spot, mole, or lentil, and phakomatosis suggests the presence of a congenital lesion or birthmark (Berg 1991). Historically, this term was applied to a group of genetic disorders defined by the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), skin, and one or more body systems. Over time, this group expanded to include over 40 entities, each with its own specific features (Chalhub 1976). This chapter reviews six of the more common neurocutaneous syndromes and the current designation for these disorders, with a particular emphasis on the CNS tumors occurring in each disease: neurofibromatosis types 1 (NF1) and 2 (NF2), tuberous sclerosis (TS), ataxia telangiectasia (AT), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), and Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). Other comprehensive reviews discuss each entity in detail (Ranger et al. 2014; Lin and Gutmann 2013; Karajannis and Ferner 2015; Rovira et al. 2014; Chaudhary and Al-Baradie 2014; Vortmeyer et al. 2013; Sudarsanam and Ardern-Holmes 2013).

N2  - The skeleton has emerged as an important regulator of systemic glucose homeostasis, with osteocalcin and insulin representing prime mediators of the interplay between bone and energy metabolism. However, genetic evidence indicates that osteoblasts can influence global energy metabolism through additional, as yet unknown, mechanisms. Here, we report that constitutive or postnatally induced deletion of the hypoxia signaling pathway component von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) in skeletal osteolineage cells of mice led to high bone mass as well as hypoglycemia and increased glucose tolerance, not accounted for by osteocalcin or insulin. In vitro and in vivo data indicated that Vhl-deficient osteoblasts displayed massively increased glucose uptake and glycolysis associated with upregulated HIF-target gene expression, resembling the Warburg effect that typifies cancer cells. Overall, the glucose consumption by the skeleton was increased in the mutant mice, as revealed by 18F-FDG radioactive tracer experiments. Moreover, the glycemia levels correlated inversely with the level of skeletal glucose uptake, and pharmacological treatment with the glycolysis inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA), which restored glucose metabolism in Vhl-deficient osteogenic cells in vitro, prevented the development of the systemic metabolic phenotype in the mutant mice. Altogether, these findings reveal a novel link between cellular glucose metabolism in osteoblasts and whole-body glucose homeostasis, controlled by local hypoxia signaling in the skeleton.

N2  - The incidence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms is rising, in part from detection through the increasing use of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging techniques. Initial diagnosis is generally based on imaging characteristics identified on computed tomography and/or MRI. Endoscopic ultrasound provides further imaging characterization and also enables fluid aspiration and analysis to additionally aid differentiation. The general approach to these lesions includes surgical intervention and/or surveillance imaging. Taking into account diverse presentations, varying malignant potential, and the uncertain natural history of some of these lesions, an evidence-based approach is limited. This article discusses recent updates in the diagnosis and management of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The response to hypoxia in animals involves the expression of multiple genes regulated by the alphabeta-hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). The hypoxia-sensing mechanism involves oxygen limited hydroxylation of prolyl residues in the N- and C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domains (NODD and CODD) of HIFalpha isoforms, as catalysed by prolyl hydroxylases (PHD 1-3). Prolyl hydroxylation promotes binding of HIFalpha to the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL)-elongin B/C complex, thus signalling for proteosomal degradation of HIFalpha. We reveal that certain PHD2 variants linked to familial erythrocytosis and cancer are highly selective for CODD or NODD. Crystalline and solution state studies coupled to kinetic and cellular analyses reveal how wild-type and variant PHDs achieve ODD selectivity via different dynamic interactions involving loop and C-terminal regions. The results inform on how HIF target gene selectivity is achieved and will be of use in developing selective PHD inhibitors.

N2  - Un-physiological activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is an early event in most renal cell cancers (RCC) following inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. Despite intense study, how this impinges on cancer development is incompletely understood. To test for the impact of genetic signals on this pathway, we aligned human RCC-susceptibility polymorphisms with genome-wide assays of HIF-binding and observed highly significant overlap. Allele-specific assays of HIF binding, chromatin conformation and gene expression together with eQTL analyses in human tumors were applied to mechanistic analysis of one such overlapping site at chromosome 12p12.1. This defined a novel stage-specific mechanism in which the risk polymorphism, rs12814794, directly creates a new HIF-binding site that mediates HIF-1alpha isoform specific upregulation of its target BHLHE41. The alignment of multiple sites in the HIF cis-acting apparatus with RCC-susceptibility polymorphisms strongly supports a causal model in which minor variation in this pathway exerts significant effects on RCC development.

N2  - The present study aimed to report our clinical experience regarding the diagnosis and detection of genetic mutations of pancreatic metastases, and to review the relevant literature to expand knowledge of this disease. A total of 4 cases involving pancreatic metastases, which were treated at The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between January 2013 and July 2016, were retrospectively analyzed. This retrospective study considered the clinicopathological variables of the 4 patients, and compared this data with those from the literature, which was searched using PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. All 4 patients with pancreatic metastases were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and confirmed by pathological staining and immunohistochemistry. Mutation analysis was performed in 3 patients to obtain precise mutation information for guiding and evaluating the use of molecularly targeted drugs. In summary, pancreatic metastases are rare and the majority of pancreatic metastases develop from renal cell carcinoma. Diagnoses of pancreatic metastases predominantly rely on CT, pathology and immunohistochemistry. Detection of mutations has clinical value in auxiliary diagnosis and therapy of pancreatic metastases. Based on mutation information, molecularly targeted drugs may prolong the survival of patients with unresectable pancreatic metastases. Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.

N2  - The treatment paradigm for advanced and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has evolved rapidly since the arrival of targeted therapies and novel immunotherapies. mRCC was previously treated only with cytokines. However, discoveries of mutations affecting the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (leading to increased expression of VEGF and hypoxia inducible factor/HIF-1) and of deregulations in the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway (resulting in tumor angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and tumor growth) have led to the development of numerous targeted therapies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has thus approved a total of nine targeted therapies since 2005, including VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib), a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF (bevacizumab), mTOR inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and a multityrosine kinase inhibitor (cabozantinib). Furthermore, the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has again shifted the mRCC therapeutic landscape with the FDA's approval of nivolumab. Herein, we discuss the unprecedented changes in the field of clear cell histology mRCC in both the first-line and salvage settings, and we also discuss future therapies and recommend a treatment paradigm on sequencing of these agents.

N2  - Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma (TC-RCC) is a rare recently described renal neoplasm characterized by gross, microscopic, and immunohistochemical differences from other renal tumor types and was recently classified as a distinct entity. However, this distinction remains controversial particularly because some genetic studies suggest a close relationship with papillary RCC (PRCC). The molecular basis of this disease remains largely unexplored. We therefore performed noncoding (nc) RNA/miRNA expression analysis and targeted next-generation sequencing mutational profiling on 13 TC-RCC cases (11 pure, two mixed TC-RCC/PRCC) and compared with other renal neoplasms. The expression profile of miRNAs and other ncRNAs in TC-RCC was distinct and validated 10 differentially expressed miRNAs by quantitative RT-PCR, including miR-155 and miR-34a, that were significantly down-regulated compared with PRCC cases (n = 22). With the use of targeted next-generation sequencing we identified mutations in 14 different genes, most frequently (>60% of TC-RCC cases) in ABL1 and PDFGRA genes. These mutations were present in <5% of clear cell RCC, PRCC, or chromophobe RCC cases (n > 600) of The Cancer Genome Atlas database. In summary, this study is by far the largest molecular study of TC-RCC cases and the first to investigate either ncRNA expression or their genomic profile. These results add molecular evidence that TC-RCC is indeed a distinct entity from PRCC and other renal neoplasms.

N2  - Pancreatic malignancy is the third leading cause of cancer related death in the United States with limited viable screening options. By the end of this decade, cancers are poised to become the leading cause of death with pancreatic cancer projected to be the second leading cause of cancer related mortality. Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are found in approximately 5%-14% of patients due to the increased utilization of cross-sectional imaging, with approximately 8%-10% of pancreatic cancers originating as PCLs. Current screening guidelines have shown discrepancies between morphologic characteristics of PCLs and identifying advanced pancreatic disease. Molecular analysis has emerged as a novel technology to aid in adequate diagnosis and management decisions of PCLs. Mucinous cysts including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) or mucinous cystic neoplasms have similar oncogenic mutations including KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA, PTEN, or CKDN2A, while GNAS and RNF43 mutations are specific only to IPMNs. Serous cystadenomas have been associated with a loss of tumor suppressor gene VHL, while solid-psuedopapillary neoplasms have an oncogenic mutation CTNNB1. A specific molecular marker to diagnose existing high-grade dysplasia or impending malignant transformation is yet to be identified. Moving forward it is important to advance technology in isolating and identifying high-risk molecular markers from cyst fluid while considering their increased utilization in the evaluation of PCLs.

N2  - Background: Although surgical excision remains the gold standard treatment for renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ), active surveillance and thermal ablation provide alternative options for patients at higher surgical risk.The purpose of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of image guided thermal ablation for pathologically proven T1a RCC in patients with other non-renal primary malignancies. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of our renal tumor ablation registry for the period of January 2005 to December 2013. We included patients with T1a renal tumors (< 4 cm). We excluded patients without histologically proven RCC, those with Von Hippel Lindau syndrome, and those with prior history of RCC. Two groups were created; (A) patients with RCC and history of other non-renal primary malignancy (in remission or active), (B) Patients with RCC only. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the two groups using Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis test for demographics (age, sex) and clinical characteristics (prior or current cancer history, renal tumor Size, and complications). Overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator and we conducted a log-rank test to compare the two groups. OS was measured from the procedure date to the date of last contact or death. Results: Seventy four patients were included in the study, 37 patients (50%) has other non-renal primary. The average age at procedure was 68.8 years. There was no difference in age (68.6 vs. 68.9; p = 0.842), sex (15 women and 22 men vs. 13 men and 24 women; p = 0.811), or tumor size (2.3 vs. 2.5; p = 0.107).Complication rates did not differ between the groups (2.9 vs. 5.9; p = 0.614). Median survival time for the entire population was 8.39 years. The probability of 5-yr (10-yr) survival was 0.74 (0.48). There was no difference in survival between the two groups (p = 0.384). Conclusions: Minimally invasive therapy with image guided thermal ablation provides safe and effective treatment for T1a RCC in patients with other non-renal malignancies. In our study, Primary malignancies or their therapy did not have discernible impact on the thermal ablation effectiveness, complications, or overall survival rates.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal-dominant, hereditary, multisystem neoplasia syndrome with increased susceptibility to several benign and malignant tumors. VHL occurs in about 1 in 36,000 live births and is associated with germline mutation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. VHL disease exhibits diverse genotype and phenotype correlations, exhibits variable intrafamilial and interfamilial expressivity, and can manifest with benign and malignant tumors of the central nervous system, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, and reproductive organs. Imaging and management of this entity are therefore multidisciplinary. An overview of VHL disease is presented.

N2  - The Cullin2-type ubiquitin ligases belong to the Cullin-Ring Ligase (CRL) family, which is a crucial determinant of proteasome-based degradation processes in eukaryotes. Because of the finding of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), the Cullin2-type ubiquitin ligases gain focusing in the research of many diseases, especially in tumors. These multisubunit enzymes are composed of the Ring finger protein, the Cullin2 scaffold protein, the Elongin B&C linker protein and the variant substrate recognition subunits (SRSs), among which the Cullin2 scaffold protein is the determining factor of the enzyme mechanism. Substrate recognition of Cullin2-type ubiquitin ligases depends on SRSs and results in the degradation of diseases associated substrates by intracellular signaling events. This review focuses on the diversity and the multifunctionality of SRSs in the Cullin2-type ubiquitin ligases, including VHL, LRR-1, FEM1b, PRAME and ZYG11. Recently, as more SRSs are being discovered and more aspects of substrate recognition have been illuminated, insight into the relationship between Cul2-dependent SRSs and substrates provides a new area for cancer research.

N2  - PURPOSE: To report subclinical retinal hemangioblastoma detected by enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography in at-risk twins.METHODS: Case report.RESULTS: A set of twins, age 7 years, (Twin A and Twin B) with known family history of von Hippel-Lindau disease (gene test positive) and no systemic manifestations were evaluated. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes of both twins. Anterior segment examination and intraocular pressures were unremarkable in both eyes. Twin A showed no clinically visible tumor in the right eye, and a clinically evident 4-mm hemangioblastoma in the superior retina of the left eye. The enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography demonstrated normal fovea in both eyes. However, imaging at the inferonasal juxtapapillary region in the right eye documented an intraretinal mass from nerve fiber layer to outer plexiform layer on enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography and with hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography, consistent with retinal hemangioblastoma. Twin B demonstrated no clinically visible tumors in both eyes, but the left eye showed a small hyperreflective lesion in the parafoveal region on spectral domain optical coherence tomography from inner to outer nuclear layers, with no cystoid changes or subretinal fluid. The lesion was slightly hyperfluorescent on fluorescein angiography, consistent with hemangioblastoma. The optical coherence tomography angiography showed no vascularity within the lesion. Twin A was treated with laser photocoagulation to the larger hemangioblastoma in the left eye, and the asymptomatic juxtapapillary tumor was observed. Twin B was managed with cautious observation as treatment to the left eye could lead to vision loss.CONCLUSION: Patients at risk for retinal hemangioblastoma should have routine imaging with fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography for subclinical detection of asymptomatic tumors.

N2  - The aim of the study was detailed clinicopathological investigation of SMARCB1/INI1-deficient sinonasal carcinomas, including molecular genetic analysis of mutational status and DNA methylation of selected protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes by means of next generation sequencing (NGS) and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). A total of 4/56 (7%) cases of SMARCB1/INI1-deficient carcinomas were detected among 56 sinonasal carcinomas diagnosed over a 19 year period using immunohistochemical screening. The series comprised 3 males and 1 female, aged 27-76 years (median 64 years). All tumors arose in the nasal cavity. Three neoplasms were diagnosed in advanced stage pT4. During the follow-up period (range 14-111 months (median 72 months)), three tumors recurred locally, but none of the patients developed regional or distant metastases. Ultimately, two patients died due to the tumor. Microscopically, all tumors consisted of infiltrating nests of polygonal basaloid cells with a variable component of rhabdoid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, there was almost diffuse expression of cytokeratins (CK), p16, p40 and p63 in all cases, while expression of CK5/6, CK7 and vimentin was only focal or absent. The detection of NUT gave negative results. In three cases, the absence of SMARCB1/INI1 expression was due to deletion of SMARCB1/INI1 gene. Methylation of SMARCB1/INI1 gene was not found. One tumor harbored HPV18 E6/E7 mRNA. All 12 genes (BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, KIT, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, RET, and ROS1) tested for mutations using NGS were wild-type. Regarding DNA methylation, all four SMARCB1/INI1-deficient tumors showed methylation of RASSF1 gene by means of MS-MLPA. There was a statistically significant difference in RASSF1 gene methylation between SMARCB1/INI1-deficient and SMARCB1/INI1-positive tumors (p = 0.0095). All other examined genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CADM1, CASP8, CD44, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CHFR, DAPK1, ESR1, FHIT, GSTP1, HIC1, KLLN, MLH1a, MLH1b, RARB, and VLH) were unmethylated. In summary, we described four cases of SMARCB1/INI1-deficient sinonasal carcinoma with detailed clinicopathological data indicating that these tumors can be regarded as a distinct entity with aggressive behaviour. For the first time, we performed analysis of DNA methylation in SMARCB1/INI1-deficient sinonasal carcinomas, reporting on significantly higher methylation of RASSF1 gene in this neoplasm.

N2  - Germline mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2) or Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) genes cause hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. While SDHB (1p36) and VHL (3p25) are associated with autosomal dominant disease, SDHD (11q23) and SDHAF2 (11q13) show a remarkable parent-of-origin effect whereby tumor formation is almost completely dependent on paternal transmission of the mutant allele. Loss of the entire maternal copy of chromosome 11 occurs frequently in SDHD-linked tumors, and has been suggested to be the basis for this typical inheritance pattern.Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, microsatellite marker and SNP array analysis, we demonstrate that loss of the entire copy of chromosome 11 is also frequent in SDHAF2-related PGLs, occurring in 89% of tumors. Analysis of two imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMR) in 11p15, H19-DMR and KvDMR, showed that this loss always affected the maternal copy of chromosome 11. Likewise, loss of maternal chromosome 11p15 was demonstrated in 85% of SDHD and 75% of VHL-related PGLs/PCCs. By contrast, both copies of chromosome 11 were found to be retained in 62% of SDHB-mutated PGLs/PCCs, while only 31% showed loss of maternal chromosome 11p15. Genome-wide copy number analysis revealed frequent loss of 1p in SDHB mutant tumors and show greater genomic instability compared to SDHD and SDHAF2.These results show that loss of the entire copy of maternal chromosome 11 is a highly specific and statistically significant event in SDHAF2, SDHD and VHL-related PGLs/PCCs, but is less significant in SDHB-mutated tumors, suggesting that these tumors have a distinct genetic etiology.

N2  - Hemangioblastoma tends to occur in the infratentorial regions and rarely in the supratentorial regions. This tumor is strongly associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD), especially in the supratentorial regions, with only 12 cases of suprasellar hemangioblastoma unrelated to VHLD. However, all these cases were diagnosed based on clinical screening and confirmation of family history. We report a case of suprasellar hemangioblastoma that was successfully removed through an extended transsphenoidal approach and diagnosed as a sporadic case unrelated to VHLD by immunohistochemical examination.A 67-year-old woman had mild diabetes insipidus and a visual field defect. Head magnetic resonance imaging revealed a suprasellar tumor compressing the optic chiasm upward. The tumor was totally removed without complication through an extended transsphenoidal approach. Postoperative histologic examination disclosed large vacuolated stromal cells and rich capillary networks, and the diagnosis was established as hemangioblastoma. Clinical screening and confirmation of family history revealed no specific results, and additional immunohistochemical staining showed diffuse cytoplasmic expression of anti-VHLD gene-derived protein (pVHL).We emphasize that pVHL immunohistochemical evaluation would be wise to adopt, especially for patients with a high risk of VHLD related to younger age and supratentorial lesions.

N2  - The concurrence of different types of brain tumors is extremely rare. We present a 29-yearold women with brainstem hemangioblastoma, posterior fossa meningiomas and a pituitary spaceoccupying lesion causing hyperprolactinemia.Despite multiple primary intracranial tumors,through systemic work-up, no other manifestation related to von Hippel-Lindau(VHL) disease was found. Complete resection of the brainstem hemangioblastoma and posterior fossa meningiomas was achieved in one single operation via a sub-occipital posterior combined with retrosigmoid approach. The patient was discharged without obvious postoperative complications. Gene copy number analysis based on quantitative PCR revealed partial deletion of Exon 1 in VHL gene in the peripheral blood, brainstem hemangioblastoma and meningiomas. The germline and somatic abnormality in VHL gene might be causally related to tumorigenesis in tumors other than hemangioblastoma,although the exact mechanism is unclear. A close follow-up is significant for such a patient with a de-novo deletion of VHL gene.

N2  - Clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) formation is connected to functional loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Recent data identified its gene product, pVHL, as a multifunctional adaptor protein which interacts with HIFalpha subunits but also with the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is hardly expressed and rarely mutated in most ccRCC. We showed that low and absent p53 expression correlated with the severity of VHL mutations in 262 analyzed ccRCC tissues. In contrast to nonsense and frameshift mutations which abrogate virtually all pVHL functions, missense mutations may rather influence one or few functions. Therefore, we focused on four VHL missense mutations, which affect the overlapping pVHL binding sites of p53 and Elongin C, by investigating their impact on HIFalpha degradation, p53 expression and signaling, as well as on cellular behavior using ccRCC cell lines and tissues. TP53 mRNA and its effector targets p21, Bax and Noxa, were altered both in engineered cell lines and in tumor tissues which carried the same missense mutations. Two of these mutations were not able to degrade HIFalpha whereas the remaining two mutations led to HIFalpha downregulation, suggesting the latter are p53 binding site-specific. The selected VHL missense mutations further enhanced tumor cell survival, but had no effects on cell proliferation. Whereas Sunitinib was able to efficiently reduce cell proliferation, Camptothecin was additionally able to increase apoptotic activity of the tumor cells. It is concluded that systematic characterization of the VHL mutation status may help optimizing targeted therapy for patients with metastatic ccRCC.

N2  - Kidney cancer is not a single disease but is made up of a number of different types of cancer classified by histology that are disparate in presentation, clinical course, and genetic basis. Studies of families with inherited renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have provided the basis for our understanding of the causative genes and altered metabolic pathways in renal cancer with different histologies. Von Hippel-Lindau disease was the first renal cancer disorder with a defined genetic basis. Over the next two decades, the genes responsible for a number of other inherited renal cancer syndromes including hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, Birt-Hogg-Dube'syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma, and succinate dehydrogenase-associated renal cancer were identified. Recently, renal cell carcinoma has been confirmed as part of the clinical phenotype in individuals from families with BAP1-associated tumor predisposition syndrome and MiTF-associated cancer syndrome. Here we summarize the clinical characteristics of and causative genes for these and other inherited RCC syndromes, the pathways that are dysregulated when the inherited genes are mutated, and recommended clinical management of patients with these inherited renal cancer syndromes.

N2  - Extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma occurs in nervous paraneuraxial structures, somatic tissues, and visceral organs, as part of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD) or in sporadic cases. The VHL gene plausibly plays a key role in the initiation and tumorigenesis of both central nervous system and extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma, therefore, the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms of the tumor growth are initially reviewed. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VHLD are summarized, with emphasis on the distinction of sporadic hemangioblastoma from the form fruste of VHLD (eg, hemangioblastoma-only VHLD). The world literature on the topic of extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas has been comprehensively reviewed with ~200 cases reported to date: up to 140 paraneuraxial, mostly of proximal spinal nerve roots, and 65 peripheral, 15 of soft tissue, 6 peripheral nerve, 5 bone, and 39 of internal viscera, including 26 renal and 13 nonrenal. A handful of possible yet uncertain cases from older literature are not included in this review. The clinicopathologic features of extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma are selectively presented by anatomic site of origin, and the differential diagnosis is emphasized in these subsets.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is the most important and frequently mutated gene in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In contrast to its long counterpart, the internal translational variant of VHL protein (VHLs) is evolutionarily conserved. Herein we present evidence that VHLs associates with ribosome complex via interaction with the large subunit 6 (RPL6). Manipulation of VHLs expression significantly alters protein synthesis, cell size and mitochondrial mass. VHLs deficiency leads to remarkable sensitivity to drug treatments eliciting nascent protein mis-folding and translational errors. The ubiquitination of nascent peptides are dramatically increased upon the ectopic over-expression of VHLs, which simultaneously co-localizes with proteasome and thus may facilitate the ubiquitin-proteasome mediated degradation. In summary, VHLs contributes to protein quality control in addition to its canonical function in maintaining homeostasis of hypoxia-induced factors alpha subunit (HIFalpha) in response to environmental oxygen supply.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome associated with mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3p25. The loss of functional VHL protein contributes to tumorigenesis. This condition is characterized by development of benign and malignant tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) and the internal organs, including kidney, adrenal gland, and pancreas. We herein describe the case of a 74-year-old man carrying the VHL gene mutation who was affected by simultaneous colorectal adenocarcinoma, renal clear cell carcinoma, and hemangioblastomas of CNS.

N2  - It is estimated that up to 8% of currently diagnosed renal cancers are part of a hereditary syndrome. The radiologist may be the first person to associate a renal tumor presenting during an imaging study to other manifestations of a hereditary syndrome. This diagnosis can have broad implications for the patient but also for other family members. This update reviews the current known associations and emerging mutations of hereditary renal cancers from a radiologist's perspective. Renal manifestations, as well as associated radiological findings and pitfalls are discussed. Additionally, screening and surveillance recommendations are also discussed to aid radiologists in the decision-making process for patient management. Copyright © 2018

N2  - Chuvash polycythemia is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease, with affected homozygotes having decreased survival mainly because of increased incidence of stroke and other thrombotic complications. Intriguingly this risk may be augmented, rather than ameliorated, by phlebotomies (Sergueeva et al, Blood, 2015, and Haematologica 2017). Chuvash polycythemia is characterized by a C to T missense mutation of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene at nucleotide 589 (VHL <sup>C589T</sup>, encoding VHL<sup>R200W</sup>). VHL is a negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits. Homozygosity for VHL <sup>C589T</sup> upregulates hypoxic responses through constitutively augmented HIF signaling even in normoxia, resulting in an increase of erythropoiesis. Heterozygosity leads to only mild augmentation of hypoxia sensing. Chuvash polycythemia was first identified in people of the Chuvash region in Russia, where it has estimated heterozygosity frequency of 1.7%, likely due to a founder effect. The incidence of Chuvash polycythemia elsewhere is sporadic, and the condition is found in other ethnic groups, including northern Indians of Indo-European ethnicity and northern Europeans. Another hot spot of gene frequency was found among Italians on the island of Ischia. We previously published that VHL <sup>C589T</sup>homozygotes from various parts of the world share a common VHL haplotype, and from the size of the shared haplotype, we could calculate that it originated from the same founder about 30-50,000 years ago (Liu, et al, Blood 2004). The same shared haplotype was also identified in Ischia in VHL <sup>C589T</sup>homozygotes (Perrotta et al, Blood 2006). A single individual from Turkey had the VHL <sup>C589T</sup> mutation on a different haplotype (Turkish haplotype, Cario, et al, Heamatologica, 2005) demonstrating the existence of another independent founder of the VHL <sup>C589T</sup> mutation. Two polycythemic patients with VHL <sup>C589T</sup> mutation were recently referred to us, one from Afghanistan (among people using the Dravidian language who had frequent historical interactions with Turkey) and the other from southern India (the ethnicity of which is also Dravidian and distinct from Indo-European ethnicity). We hypothesized that the Chuvash polycythemia patients, who originated from Afghanistan and Southern India, might have the Turkish haplotype, strengthening support for two independent founders of this haplotype. We analyzed the VHL haplotype of these 2 individuals using 6 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genomic DNA was isolated from granulocytes. Haplotype analysis was performed by Sanger Sequencing. We found that the Chuvash polycythemia patients from Afghanistan and Southern India shared the common Chuvash haplotype (Table). We conclude that the Chuvash haplotype is also present in VHL <sup>C589T</sup> homozygotes in Afghanistan and Southern India, suggesting that the VHL <sup>C589T</sup> mutation in these areas arose from the same common founder. The data support the notion that the Chuvash polycythemia VHL mutation originated relatively early in modern human evolution-possibly after humans moved from Africa-as it is present in different ethnic and racial groups (Europeans and Asians). This observation is compatible with the notion that VHL <sup>C589T</sup> heterozygosity provides some evolutionary advantage (present in various ethnic groups and did not disappear, i.e., absence of negative selection because of increased mortality of homozygotes). It has been shown that heterozygosity for VHL <sup>C589T</sup> provides some protection from anemia; it is likely that other evolutionary benefits remain to be identified (Miasnikova et al, Haematologica 2011). Yet, such an advantage is very mild (very low gene frequency worldwide of this mutation). These data provide additional evidence that support a VHL <sup>C589T</sup> origin before Asians and European diverged.

N2  - Context: The von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein is a key executor of the cellular hypoxic response that is compromised in preeclampsia, a serious disorder complicating 5-7% of pregnancies. To date, the mechanisms controlling VHL gene expression in the human placenta remain elusive.Objective: We examined VHL epigenetic regulation in normal pregnancy and in preeclampsia, a pathology characterized by placental hypoxia.Design, Setting, and Participants: Placentae were obtained from early-onset (E-PE: n=56; <34 weeks of gestation) and late onset preeclampsia (L-PE: n=19; >= 34 weeks of gestation). Placentae from healthy normotensive age-matched preterm and term pregnancies (PTC: n=43; TC: n=23) were included as controls.Main Outcome Measure(s): We measured the activity of Jumonji domain containing protein 6 (JMJD6), a Fe2+ and oxygen-dependent histone demethylase, and examined its function in the epigenetic control of VHL.Results: JMJD6 regulates VHL gene expression in the human placenta. VHL downregulation in preeclampsia is dependent on decreased JMJD6 demethylase activity due to hypoxia and reduced Fe2+ bioavailability. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed decreased association of JMJD6 and its histone targets with the VHL promoter. Findings in preeclampsia were corroborated in a murine model of pharmacological hypoxia using FG-4592. Placentae from FG-4592 treated mice exhibited reduced VHL levels, accompanied by placental morphological alterations and reduced pup weights. Notably, Fe2+ supplementation rescued JMJD6 histone demethylase activity in histone from E-PE and FG-4592-treated mice.Conclusions: Our study uncovers novel epigenetic regulation of VHL and its functional consequences for altered oxygen and iron homeostasis in preeclampsia.

N2  - Background: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PHEO/PGL) are neuroendocrine tumors that arise from adrenal medulla, and sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia due to various causes. Pediatric patients with PHEO/PGL are not common but more highly associated with genetic mutations than adults. We report three pediatric patients with PHEO/PGL due to various causes. Clinical Cases: Patient 1 had abdominal pain after external injury at the age of 11. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed retroperitoneal masses. He had headache and hypertension. Urine normetanephrine levels elevated, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple abdominal PGLs. The PGLs were excised after the preoperative preparation ofalpha-blocker and saline infusion. We detected a germline mutation in the SDHD gene. Patient 2 had marfanoid habitus, chronic diarrhea and mucosal neuromas of the tongue at the age of 13. She was diagnosed as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) due to a germline mutation in the RET gene. She also suffered from medullary thyroid carcinoma. Urine metanephrine levels elevated, and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy demonstrated bilateral PHEOs. Bilateral adrenalectomy after the preoperative preparation was performed before thyroidectomy. She had replacement therapy with hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone and thyroxine. Patient 3 had tricuspid atresia (cyanotic congenital heart disease: CCHD) followed by the Fontan surgery. She had experienced mild hypoxia since birth. She did not have any specific symptoms related to PHEO/PGL. During cardiac catheterization, her blood pressure increased markedly, and analpha-blocker was administered. Urine normetanephrine levels elevated, and abdominal CT demonstrated a tumor in the right adrenal gland. Surgical treatment was performed, and PHEO was pathologically confirmed. We did not detect any germline mutations in the RET, VHL, SDHB, SDHD, TMEM127 and, MAX genes. Every patient had no family history of PHEO/PGL. Conclusion: Approximately 70% of pediatric patients with PHEO/PGL have a germline mutation. Clinical features suspecting hereditary causes include a positive family history, syndromic features such as neurofibromatos type 1, MEN2 and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, and multifocal, bilateral, or metastatic conditions. In our study, the germline mutations were proven in the patients with multiple PGLs and MEN2B. Although the patient with PHEO accompanied by CCHD had no germline mutation, several studies report that hypoxia can increase a risk of PHEO/PGL. We conclude that genetic tests should be performed in pediatric patients with PHEO/PGL with a positive family history, syndromic features, and multifocal, bilateral, or metastatic condition and that continuous hypoxia can be a risk of PHEO/PGL.

N2  - Families of tumor-suppressor genes, such as those involved in homologous recombination or mismatch repair, contain individual genes implicated in hereditary cancer syndromes. Collectively, such groupings establish that inactivating germline changes in genes within pathways related to genomic repair can promote carcinogenesis. The hypoxia pathway, whose activation is associated with aggressive and resistant sporadic tumors, is another pathway in which tumor-suppressor genes have been identified. von Hippel-Lindau disease, some of the hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC) syndromes, and the syndrome of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma are heritable conditions associated with genes involved or associated with the hypoxia pathway. This review links these heritable cancer syndromes to the hypoxia pathway while also comparing the relative aggression and treatment resistance of syndrome-associated tumors to similar, sporadic tumors. The reader will become aware of shared phenotypes (e.g., PGL/PCC, renal cell carcinoma) among these three hypoxia-pathway-associated heritable cancer syndromes as well as the known associations of tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance within these pathways.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL) and unrestrained activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Genetic and epigenetic determinants have an impact on HIF pathways. A recent genome-wide association study on renal cancer susceptibility identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an intergenic region located between the oncogenes MYC and PVT1. Here using assays of chromatin conformation, allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome editing, we show that HIF binding to this regulatory element is necessary to trans-activate MYC and PVT1 expression specifically in cells of renal tubular origins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the risk-associated polymorphisms increase chromatin accessibility and activity as well as HIF binding to the enhancer. These findings provide further evidence that genetic variation at HIF-binding sites modulates the oncogenic transcriptional output of the VHL-HIF axis and provide a functional explanation for the disease-associated effects of SNPs in ccRCC.

N2  - Exosomes are extracellularly secreted vesicles ranging from 40 to 100 nm in diameter that are thought to play important roles in intercellular communication. Exosomes contain numerous proteins, RNA, and lipids that can affect the status of recipient cells under various pathological conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a major role in post-transcriptional gene silencing by interacting with the 3'-untranslated regions of target genes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been reported to induce sustained elevation of cellular miRNAs such as miR-155. We hypothesized that miRNAs delivered by exosomes might affect the angiogenesis of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Here, we demonstrated that co-culture of EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells (Raji) with retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells increased the level of miR-155 in recipient cells whereas no major difference was detected for co-culture with EBV-negative BL cells (Ramos). Isolated Raji exosomes increased transcriptional and translational levels of VEGF-A in ARPE-19 cells, which was reversely correlated with von Hippel-Lindau expression. A human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay showed that delivery of ectopic miR-155 rendered ARPE-19 cells proangiogenic. Our results demonstrate that sustained accumulation of miR-155 mediated by exosomes might affect remote recipient cells such as retinal pigment epithelial cells.

N2  - The KCL016 human embryonic stem cell line was derived from an embryo donated for research that carried an autosomal dominant mutation affecting splicing site of the VHL gene encoding von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (676+3A>T). The ICM was isolated using laser microsurgery and plated on gamma-irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. Both the derivation and cell line propagation were performed in an animal product-free environment. Pluripotent state and differentiation potential were confirmed by in vitro assays.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a dominantly inherited multisystem cancer syndrome caused by a heterozygous mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Previous studies suggested that similar populations of Caucasian and Japanese patients have similar genotype or phenotype characteristics. In this comprehensive study of East Asian patients, we investigated the genetic and clinical characteristics of patients with VHL syndrome.METHODS: To create a registry of clinical characteristics and mutations reported in East Asian patients with VHL syndrome, we conducted a comprehensive review of English language and non-English language articles identified through a literature search. Publications in Japanese or Chinese language were read by native speakers of the language, who then performed the data extraction.RESULTS: Of 237 East Asian patients with VHL syndrome, 154 unique kindreds were identified for analysis. Analyzed by kindred, missense mutations were the most common (40.9%, 63/154), followed by large/complete deletions (32.5%, 50/154) and nonsense mutations (11.7%, 18/154). Compared with a previously reported study of both East Asian and non-East Asian patients, we found several key differences. First, missense and frameshift mutations in the VHL gene occurred less commonly in our population of East Asian patients (40.9% vs. 52.0%; P = 0.012 and 8.4% vs. 13.0%; P < 0.001, respectively). Second, large/complete deletions were more common in our population of East Asian patients (32.5% vs. 10.5%; P < 0.001). Third, phenotypically, we observed that, in our population of East Asian patients with VHL syndrome, the incidence of retinal capillary hemangioblastoma was lower, whereas the incidence of renal cell carcinoma was higher.CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of East Asian patients with VHL syndrome differ from other populations. This should be considered when making screening recommendations for VHL syndrome in Asia.

N2  - Renal cell carcinomas (RCC), mostly occurring in adults aged 60-70 years, can result from well-known factors like cigarette smoking, obesity and hypertension. However, they have been associated with genetic alterations in children and young adults. A 28 year-old male patient with a confirmed RCC underwent biomolecular and immunohistochemical analyses due to his young age. A point mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene was identified. Young patients under 40 years with diagnosed RCC should undergo additional diagnostic investigation, hence the discovery of an underlying cause. This could be important for further treatment and counseling of these young patients.

N2  - Serrated colorectal adenocarcinoma (SAC) is a morphologically distinct subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC), in which increased HIF-1alpha mRNA expression and HIF-1alpha protein stabilization are typical features. Here we aimed to further elucidate HIF-1alpha protein expression in serrated and non-serrated colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and their precursor lesions and its association with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvascular density (MVD). HIF-1alpha and VEGF expressions were determined immunohistochemically in 134 serrated polyps (SPs), 104 non-serrated adenomas (NSAs), 81 SACs, and 74 matched conventional adenocarcinomas (CCs) and were correlated with morphology, clinicopathological features, and MVD. In premalignant lesions, both HIF-1alpha and VEGF were expressed in the vast majority of SPs and NSAs. In CRCs, HIF-1alpha protein was also present in 77.8 % of SACs, while only 20.3 % of CCs were HIF-1alpha proficient. MVD was significantly higher in SACs, but the serrated morphology was the only significant predictor of MVD in CRC in multivariate analyses. HIF-1alpha protein is often stabilized in well-vascularized SACs, suggesting hypoxia-independent stabilization of HIF-1alpha. Moreover, HIF-1alpha stabilization did not associate with oncogenic activation of BRAF or KRAS or Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutation. Prevalent HIF-1alpha expression in SAC and its precursors support the importance of HIF-1alpha-mediated pathways for the serrated route of colorectal carcinogenesis.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Intradural spinal hemangioblastoma are infrequent, vascular, pathologically benign tumors occurring either sporadically or in association with von Hippel-Lindau disease along the neural axis. Described in fewer than 1,000 cases, literature is variable with respect to epidemiological factors associated with spinal hemangioblastoma and their treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of intradural spinal hemangioblastoma with the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database while also presenting an illustrative case.METHODS: The SEER database was queried for cases of spinal hemangioblastoma between 2000 and 2010 with the use of SEER*Stat software. Incidence was evaluated as a function of age, sex and race. Survival was evaluated with the Cox proportionate hazards ratio using IBM SPSS software evaluating age, sex, location, treatment modality, pathology and number of primaries (p = 0.05). Descriptive statistics of the same factors were also calculated. The case of a 43-year-old patient with a surgical upper cervical intramedullary hemangioblastoma is also presented.RESULTS: In the data set between 2000 and 2010, there were 133 cases with an age-adjusted incidence of 0.014 (0.012-0.017) per 100,000 to the standard USA population. Hemangioblastoma was the tenth most common intradural spinal tumor type representing 2.1% (133 of 6,156) of all spinal tumors. There was no difference in incidence between men and women with an female:male rate ratio of 1.05 (0.73-1.50) with p = 0.86. The average age of patients was 48.0 (45.2-50.9) years, and a lower incidence was noted in patients <15 years compared to all other age groups (p < 0.05). There was no difference in incidence amongst the different races. Treatment included surgical resection in 106 (79.7%) cases, radiation with surgery in 7 (5.3%) cases, and radiation alone was used in only 1 (0.8%) case, and no treatment was performed in 17 (12.8%) cases. Mortality was noted in 12 (9%) cases, and median survival of 27.5 months (range 1-66 months) over the 10-year period. Mortality was attributable to the malignancy in 3 (2%) cases. There was no statistically significant different in Cox hazard ratios for mortality for sex, race, treatment modality, pathology or number of primaries.CONCLUSIONS: Spinal hemangioblastoma represent a small fraction of primary intradural spinal tumors, and this study did not identify any difference in incidence between genders. Surgical treatment alone was the most common treatment modality. Overall prognosis is good, with 9% observed mortality over the 10-year period, with 2% mortality attributable to the malignancy.

N2  - Somatic mutations binding to the patient's MHC and recognized by autologous T cells (neoepitopes) are ideal cancer vaccine targets. They combine a favorable safety profile due to a lack of expression in healthy tissues with a high likelihood of immunogenicity, as T cells recognizing neoepitopes are not shaped by central immune tolerance. Proteins mutated in cancer (neoantigens) shared by patients have been explored as vaccine targets for many years. Shared (public) mutations, however, are rare, as the vast majority of cancer mutations in a given tumor are unique for the individual patient. Recently, the novel concept of truly individualized cancer vaccination emerged, which exploits the vast source of patient-specific private mutations. Concurrence of scientific advances and technological breakthroughs enables the rapid, cost-efficient, and comprehensive mapping of the mutanome, which is the entirety of somatic mutations in an individual tumor, and the rational selection of neoepitopes. How to transform tumor mutanome data to actionable knowledge for tailoring individualized vaccines on demand has become a novel research field with paradigm-shifting potential. This review gives an overview with particular focus on the clinical development of such vaccines. Copyright © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - We described clinical course of a 24-year-old woman with 3p deletion syndrome associated with cerebellar hemangioblastoma at the age of 16 years old. She presented dysmorphic facial features, growth retardation and severe psychomotor retardation associated with 3p deletion syndrome. We identified de novo 3p deletion encompassing p25 by using array-based comparative genomic hybridization, where causative gene of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease located. Surgical therapy for cerebellar hemangioblastoma was performed, and histological examination was consistent in cerebellar hemangioblastoma. She showed no other tumors associated VHL disease till 24 years old. This is the first case report of a patient with 3p deletion syndrome whose cerebellar hemangioblastoma may be associated with VHL disease. Repeat imaging studies were recommended for the patients with 3p deletion syndrome.

N2  - C12orf59 is newly identified gene in kidney. However, the relation of C12orf59 expression and clinic features is unknown. Here, our study showed that C12orf59 was broadly expressed in normal human tissues with high expression levels in kidney while its expression is beyond detectable in a panel of cancer cell lines. C12orf59 expression in RCC was significantly decreased compared with corresponding adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.01). The decreased C12orf59 expression was correlated with lymph node status (P < 0.05), distant metastases (P < 0.05), poor survival (P < 0.001) (HR 3.00; 95% CI, 1.29-7.53), VHL non-sense mutations or frame-shift mutations (P < 0.01), and UMPP gene non-sense mutations or frame-shift mutations (P = 0.01). Thus, we propose that the decreased C12orf59 expression status is a prognostic biomarker of ccRCC and cooperates with the loss of VHL all the while promoting renal carcinogenesis.

N2  - Purpose: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), without an identified kidney primary, has been reported rarely. We report a patient with RCC metastatic to bilateral adrenal glands and liver, without an apparent renal primary. We detail the immunohistochemical and molecular studies employed to substantiate the diagnosis of RCC and direct therapy. Methods: Histopathologic findings were correlated with imaging data and supplemented by a panel of immunohistochemical stains, as well as tumor sequence analysis. Results: Despite the presence of bilateral adrenal masses and lack of tumor within kidney parenchyma, the diagnosis of RCC was substantiated by immunohistochemistry (RCC+/PAX2+/PAX8+/Melan-A-/SF-1- among others) and molecular genetic analysis, harboring mutations in VHL,TP53, KDM5C, and PBRM1. After debulking surgery, based on the diagnosis of RCC and the molecular profile, the patient was treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sunitinib), resulting in stablilization of disease. Conclusions: This case illustrates the role of mutational analysis in carcinomas with rare or unusual presentations, such as metastatic RCC without a renal primary.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and HIF-2alpha play an important role in liver fibrosis. von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), a key mediator of HIF-alpha, regulates fibrosis in an organ- and cell-specific way. In this study, human liver samples were collected from hepatitis C-, alcoholic-, and cholestatic-associated fibrotic and healthy individuals. Two mouse models of liver fibrosis were established: bile duct ligation and carbon tetrachloride injection. We constructed adenovirus vectors to overexpress VHL, normoxia-active HIF-alpha, and lentiviral vectors to silence HIF-alpha. The results showed that liver sections from fibrosis patients had a lower level of VHL and higher levels of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha compared with healthy sections, a finding which was confirmed in mice. Overexpression of VHL attenuated liver fibrosis, downregulated fibrogenic genes, and inhibited liver inflammation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Overexpression of VHL was more successful at inhibiting fibrosis compared with silencing HIF-1alpha plus HIF-2alpha. Normoxia-active HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha prevented the inhibitory effect of VHL on liver fibrosis, indicating that attenuating fibrosis via VHL is HIF-1alpha- and HIF-2alpha-dependent to some extent. In addition, overexpression of VHL inhibited mouse hepatic stellate cells activation and proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Taken together, VHL may be considered a new target to inhibit liver fibrosis.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are benign central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms that present as sporadic, isolated lesions or as a subset of CNS lesions in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. VHL disease caused by a germline mutation of VHL on chromosome 3 predisposes individuals to multi-organ tumors, including clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs), as well as HBs. HBs have not been analyzed in detail regarding genetic and epigenetic alterations as much as ccRCCs. METHODS: Genetic and epigenetic alterations were comprehensively analyzed in 11 VHL disease-related HBs and 21 sporadic ones. RESULTS: Using direct sequencing, target deep sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assays, VHL alterations were detected in 100% and 62% of VHL-related and sporadic HBs, respectively. Using data from single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, the almost similar ratios of VHLrelated and sporadic HBs were found loss of heterogyzosity (LOH) on chromosome 3 (64% and 57%, respectively). VHL premotor hypermethylation was detected only in sporadic HBs (33%). The rate of biallelic VHL inactivation among VHL-related and sporadic HBs was 64% and 52%, respectively. No significant mutation of PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, which are novel candidate genes that may be causative for ccRCCs, was detected in HBs by using target deep sequencing. No HB of CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype), which was known to be detected in a subset of ccRCCs, was detected by using an Illumina Infinium 450K methylation chip. CONCLUSION: Although biallelic inactivation of VHL is a dominant mechanism in the pathogenesis of HBs, as well as ccRCCs, other unknown mechanisms different from ccRCCs may also be involved in the pathogenesis of HBs.

N2  - Recent findings demonstrated that a subset of papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) is characterized by reduced expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, and that lowest levels associated with more aggressive PTCs. In the present study, the levels of the two VHL mRNA splicing variants, VHL-213 (V1) and VHL-172 (V2), were measured in a series of 96 PTC and corresponding normal matched tissues by means of quantitative RT-PCR. Variations in the mRNA levels were correlated with patients' clinicopathological parameters and disease-free interval (DFI). The analysis of VHL mRNA in tumor tissues, compared to normal matched tissues, revealed that its expression was either up- or down-regulated in the majority of PTC. In particular, V1 and V2 mRNA levels were altered, respectively, in 78 (81.3%) and 65 (67.7%) out of the 96 PTCs analyzed. A significant positive correlation between the two mRNA variants was observed (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis documented the lack of association between each variant and clinicopathological parameters such as age, tumor size, histology, TNM stage, lymph node metastases, and BRAF mutational status. However, a strong correlation was found between altered V1 or V2 mRNA levels and DFI. Multivariate regression analysis indicated higher V1 mRNA values, along with lymph node metastases at diagnosis, as independent prognostic factors predicting DFI. In conclusion, the data reported demonstrate that VHL gene expression is deregulated in the majority of PTC tissues. Of particular interest is the apparent protective role exerted by VHL transcripts against PTC recurrences.

N2  - Human tumor cell lines, especially those with complete data and follow-up, are important tools in tumor biological studies. Clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) is not sensitive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and treatment of patients with distant metastasis relies on targeted therapy. Here, we report the establishment of seven new ccRCC stable cell lines that were continuously cultured for more than 20 generations among 81 cases of renal cell cancer. Moreover, gene expression and methylation in the established cell lines, in those that had a finite in vitro life span of less than 10 generations, and in cells that originated from the same culture at different generations were profiled using microarrays. Genes including SLC34A2, SEPP1, SULT1C4 and others were differentially expressed in established cell lines and finite cell lines, and changes in their expression might be caused by methylation or demethylation. The expression level of SLC34A2 was related not only to the life span in vitro culture but also to tumor size. Additionally, six of the seven new ccRCC cell lines had VHL deletions or termination mutations. So in addition to the establishment of seven new ccRCC cell lines with complete clinical data, we conclude that genes such as SLC34A2 and VHL play key roles in the continuous in vitro growth and development of ccRCC.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this case report was to highlight the importance of ruling out pheochromocytoma in a patient with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and cardiovascular manifestations. Clinical Presentation and Intervention: A 22-year-old woman with type IIb VHL presented with signs and symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle with severely depressed ejection fraction, confirmed by MRI. Urinary catecholamine and metanephrine tests had elevated levels and an abdominal MRI showed the presence of two cystic masses at the left hypochondrium. Surgical resection of both masses was performed, confirming the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and clear cell renal carcinoma on histology. Six-month echocardiography showed a left ventricle with normal diameters and preserved ejection fraction. Genetic analysis revealed a germline mutation (exon 3 deletion of VHL). As there was no family history of VHL, it was determined to be a de novo mutation. Conclusion: This case report showed an atypical manifestation in a patient with VHL and underlines the importance of screening for pheochromocytoma in such patients. Copyright © 2015 S.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Degeneration of cone photoreceptors leads to loss of vision in patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other cone dystrophies. Evidence, such as choroidal ischemia and decreased choroidal blood flow, implicates reduced tissue oxygenation in AMD pathology and suggests a role of the cellular response to hypoxia in disease onset and progression. Such a chronic hypoxic situation may promote several cellular responses including stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs).METHODS: To investigate the consequence of a chronic activation of the molecular response to hypoxia in cones, von Hippel Lindau protein (VHL) was specifically ablated in cones of the all-cone R91W;Nrl <sup>-/-</sup> mouse. Retinal function and morphology was evaluated by ERG and light microscopy, while differential gene expression was tested by real-time PCR. Retinal vasculature was analyzed by immunostainings and fluorescein angiography. Two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison test was performed for statistical analysis.RESULTS: Cone-specific ablation of Vhl resulted in stabilization and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A) which led to increased expression of genes associated with hypoxia and retinal stress. Our data demonstrate severe cone degeneration and pathologic vessel growth, features that are central to AMD pathology. Subretinal neovascularization was accompanied by vascular leakage and infiltration of microglia cells. Interestingly, we observed increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (Timp3) during the aging process, a gene associated with AMD and Bruch's membrane integrity. Additional deletion of Hif1a protected cone cells, prevented pathological vessel growth and preserved vision.CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence for a HIF1A-mediated mechanism leading to pathological vessel growth and cone degeneration in response to a chronic hypoxia-like situation. Consequently, our results identify HIF1A as a potential therapeutic target to rescue hypoxia-related vision loss in patients.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of kidney cancer, representing approximately 75% of all renal neoplasms. ccRCC is known to be strongly associated with silencing of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, yet VHL deficiency alone does not seem to be sufficient to drive the oncogenic transformation of normal renal epithelium and induce renal tumorigenesis. We, and others, have previously suggested that constitutive activation of the Notch signaling pathway, alongside with VHL loss, contribute to the oncogenic features of ccRCC. Here we report a prevailing hyperactivation of the Notch1 receptor in human ccRCC relative to the healthy counterpart. To explore the consequences of the elevated Notch1 signaling observed in ccRCC patient material, we made use of a conditional mouse model based on concurrent ectopic expression of constitutively active Notch1 (NICD1) and deletion of the Vhl gene. Histological examination of the kidneys of the conditional mice demonstrate the existence of nests of dysplastic cells with a clear cytoplasm as a consequence of lipid accumulation, thus displaying a one important hallmark of human ccRCC.

N2  - Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are usually low-grade neoplasms derived from the endocrine pancreas. PNETs can be functioning and cause well-described hormonal hypersecretion syndromes or non-functioning and cause only tumor mass effect. PNETs appear to be more common recently likely due to incidental detection by imaging. Although the diagnosis and management of PNETs have been evolving rapidly, much remains to be studied in the areas of molecular pathogenesis, molecular markers of tumor behavior, early detection, and targeted drug therapy. Unique challenges facing PNETs studies are long disease course, the deep location of pancreas and difficult access to pancreatic tissue, and the variety of tumors, which make animal models valuable tools for PNETs studies. Existing animal models of PNETs have provided insights into the pathogenesis and natural history of human PNETs. Future studies on animal models of PNETs should address early tumor detection, molecular markers of tumor behavior, and novel targeted therapies. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Although cetuximab plus radiotherapy is a standard treatment for patients with inoperable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), its efficacy varies greatly among individuals. To identify predictive markers of efficacy, we examined the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in hypoxia-related and DNA repair genes on the clinical outcome and occurrence of skin toxicity. We analyzed 61 consecutive patients with HNSCC for the presence of specific SNPs (HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, HIF-1beta, VHL, FIH-1, XRCC1, and XRCC5). The results were then correlated with time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and toxicity (epithelitis, mucositis, and folliculitis). The median TTP and OS were better in patients with severe vs mild mucositis (17 vs 7 months, p = 0.03; and 26 vs 12 months, p = 0.016, respectively) and folliculitis (10 vs 7 months, p = 0.01, and 26 vs 10 months, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with the HIF-1alpha CT/TT genotype had better OS than those with the wild-type HIF-1alpha CC genotype (28 vs 13 months, p = 0.035). Patients with the XRCC5 GG/AA genotype had longer TTP than patients with the XRCC5 AG genotype (11 vs 7 months, p = 0.035). Severe skin toxicity and SNPs of HIF-1alpha and XRCC5 were associated with different outcomes among patients treated with radiotherapy plus cetuximab.

N2  - Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) have been pharmacologically linked to cell growth, angiogenesis, and tumor progression, which make it an attractive target for cancer therapy. We investigated MetAP2's biological role in glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive tumor characterized by massive neovascularization. We examined the effect of anti-MetAP2 RNA interference on proliferation and angiogenesis in GBM cell line. The biological effects of MetAP2 knockdown were assessed by comparing the proliferation, tumorigenecity, and angiogenesis of parental cells and MetAP2 knockdown cells. We generated MetAP2 knockdown cells using lentiviral short hairpin RNAs against MetAP2 in SNB19 GBM cells, which normally express high levels of MetAP2. MetAP2 knockdown cells were less proliferative and less tumorigenic when compared to the parental cells. MetAP2 knockdown decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Decreased VEGF expression in MetAP2 knockdown cells correlated very well with decreased vessel formation in a tube formation assay. We showed that VEGF suppression in MetAP2 knockdown cells was mediated by the von Hippel-Lindau protein. In in vivo animal studies using an intracranial SNB19 tumor model, MetAP2 knockdown also reduced the tumor growth rate and angiogenesis, which in turn prolonged the survival of mice in xenograft model. Our results show that MetAP2 regulates angiogenesis in GBM and identify MetAP2-specific substrates that may serve as candidates for clinical assay development.

N2  - The management of patients with hereditary kidney cancers presents unique challenges to clinicians. In addition to an earlier age of onset compared with patients with sporadic kidney cancer, those with hereditary kidney cancer syndromes often present with bilateral and/or multifocal renal tumors and are at risk for multiple de novo lesions. This population of patients may also present with extrarenal manifestations, which adds an additional layer of complexity. Physicians who manage these patients should be familiar with the underlying clinical characteristics of each hereditary kidney cancer syndrome and the suggested surgical approaches and recommendations of genetic testing for at-risk individuals.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical work suggests SRC proteins have a role in the development of resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapy in metastatic clear-cell renal cancer (mRCC). This hypothesis was tested in this trial using the SRC inhibitor saracatinib and the VEGF inhibitor cediranib.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with disease progression after >=1 VEGF-targeted therapy were eligible to participate in this double-blind, randomized (1:1) phase II study. The study compared the combination cediranib 30 mg once daily (o.d.) and saracatinib 175 mg o.d. (CS) (n = 69) or cediranib 45 mg o.d. and placebo o.d. (C) (n = 69). Archived tissue was used for biomarker analysis [SRC, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), von Hippel-Lindau, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1b and hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha : n = 86]. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1.RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2012, 138 patients were randomized across 16 UK sites. The characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. Partial responses were seen in 13.0% for C and 14.5% for CS (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in PFS [5.4 months (3.6-7.3 months) for C and 3.9 (2.4-5.3 months) for CS; hazard ratio (HR) 1.18 (0.94-1.48)] or overall survival (OS) [14.2 months (11.2-16.8 months) for C and 10.0 (6.7-13.2 months) for CS; HR 1.28 (1.00-1.63)]. There was no significant difference in the frequency of key adverse events, dose reductions or drug discontinuations. None of the biomarkers were prognostic for PFS or OS. FAK overexpression correlated with an OS benefit [HR 2.29 (1.09-4.82), P > 0.05], but not PFS, for CS.CONCLUSIONS: Saracatinib did not increase the efficacy of a VEGF-targeted therapy (cediranib) in this setting. Biomarker analysis did not identify consistent predictive biomarkers.Clinicaltrialsgov: Nct00942877.

N2  - Background Pediatric pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare with limited data on the optimal management approach. The aim of this study was to determine the role of genetic testing and imaging to detect extra-adrenal and/or metastatic tumors in pediatric pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Methods We performed a retrospective study of 55 patients diagnosed at <=21 years of age with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas with analysis of data on genetic testing and multimodal imaging. Results Eighty percent of patients (n = 44/55) had a germline mutation. The majority were found to have either VHL (38%) or SDHB (25%) mutation. Pheochromocytoma was present in 67% (n = 37/55) of patients and was bilateral in 51% (n = 19/37). The majority of patients with bilateral pheochromocytomas had VHL (79%). Abdominal paragangliomas was present in 22% (n = 12/55), head and neck paragangliomas in 11% (n = 6/55), and thoracic paragangliomas in 2 of 55 patients. For paragangliomas, SDHx accounted for 72% (n = 13/18) of mutations. The rate of malignancy was 16% (n = 9/55), 56% of whom had SDHB mutations. In two-thirds of patients, functional imaging identified either extra-adrenal paragangliomas and/or metastatic disease. Conclusion The majority of pediatric patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas have detectable germline mutations. Therefore, we suggest strongly that all pediatric patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas undergo genetic testing and imaging to detect extra-adrenal paragangliomas and metastatic disease to guide treatment and follow-up.

N2  - Central nervous system hemangioblastomas occur sporadically and in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease due to a VHL germline mutation. This mutation leads to enhanced transcription of chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), its ligand (CXCL12) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). We aimed to determine in VHL-related and sporadic hemangioblastomas CXCR4, CXCL12, and VEGFA protein expression and to correlate this to hemangioblastoma size and expression in normal surrounding tissue. 27 patients with a hemangioblastoma were included for analysis of immunohistochemistry of tissue, MRI and DNA. Hemangioblastomas overexpress CXCR4, CXCL12, and VEGFA compared to normal surrounding tissue. In sporadic hemangioblastomas the mean percentage of CXCR4 positive hemangioblastoma cells was 16 %, SD 8.4, in VHL-related hemangioblastomas 8 %, SD 4.4 (P = 0.002). There was no relation between preoperative tumor size and CXCR4 or CXCL12 expression. Compared to normal surrounding tissue CXCR4, CXCL12, and VEGFA were overexpressed in hemangioblastomas. Most interestingly, sporadic hemangioblastomas overexpress CXCR4 compared to VHL-related hemangioblastoma.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau [VHL] disease, an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome, is well known for its complex genotype-phenotype correlations. We looked for germline mutations in the VHL gene in an affected multiplex family with Type 1 VHL disease. Real-Time quantitative PCR for deletions and Sanger sequencing of coding regions along with flanking intronic regions were performed in two affected individuals and one related individual. Direct sequencing identified a novel heterozygous single nucleotide base substitution in both the affected members tested, segregating with VHL phenotype in this family. This variant in exon 3, c.473T>A, results in substitution of leucine, a highly conserved acid, to glutamine at position 158 [p.L158Q] and has not been reported thus far as a variant associated with disease causation. Further, this variant was not observed in 50 age and ethnicity matched healthy individuals. Extensive in silico prediction analysis along with molecular dynamics simulation revealed significant deleterious nature of the substitution L158Q on pVHL. The results of this study when collated support the view that the missense variation p.L158Q in the Elongin C binding domain of pVHL may be disease causing.

N2  - The loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor is a major driver of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (CC-RCC) resulting in the stabilization and overactivation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). ROCK1 is a well-known protein serine/threonine kinase which is recognized as having a role in cancer including alterations in cell motility, metastasis and angiogenesis. We recently investigated and identified a synthetic lethal interaction between VHL loss and ROCK1 inhibition in CC-RCC that is dependent on HIF overactivation. Increased expression and activity of both HIFs and ROCK1 occurs in many types of cancer supporting the potential therapeutic role of ROCK inhibitors beyond CC-RCC. We also discuss future research required to establish prognostic markers to predict tumor response to ROCK inhibitors.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogenous group of tumors, >70% of which belong to the category of clear cell carcinoma. In recent years, crucial advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular and metabolic basis of clear cell carcinoma. This tumor manifests significant alterations in the cellular metabolism, so that the tumor cells preferentially induce the hypoxia response pathway using aerobic glycolysis, rather than the normal oxidative phosphorylation for energy. Most of the clear cell carcinomas (sporadic as well as familial) have mutations and deletions in the VHL gene located at 3p (p3.25). Normally, pVHL plays a crucial role in the proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)1 and HIF2. Lack of a functioning pVHL owing to genetic alterations results in stabilization and accumulation of these factors, which promotes cell growth, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis, contributing to a neoplastic phenotype. Several other genes normally located adjacent to VHL (BAP1, SETD2, PBRM1) may also be lost. These are tumor suppressor genes whose loss not only plays a role in carcinogenesis but may also influence the clinical course of these neoplasms. In addition, interaction among a variety of other genes located at several different chromosomes may also play a role in the genesis and progression of clear cell carcinoma.

N2  - The local anesthetic lidocaine induces cell death by altering reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial electron transport chain function. Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is involved in determining oxygen metabolism and mitochondria function, we investigated the involvement of HIF-1 activity in lidocaine-induced cell death. We investigated the role of HIF activation on lidocaine-induced caspase activation and cell death in renal cell-derived RCC4 cells lacking functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. We demonstrate that HIF-1 suppressed oxygen consumption and facilitated glycolysis in a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1-dependent manner and that activation of HIF-1 conferred resistance to lidocaine-induced cell death. We also demonstrated that exogenous HIF-1 activation, through HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibition or exposure to hypoxic conditions, alleviates lidocaine toxicity by suppressing mitochondria function and generating ROS, not only in RCC4 cells, but also in the neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HIF-1 activation due to VHL deletion, treatment with small molecule HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors, and exposure to hypoxic conditions suppresses mitochondrial respiratory chain function and confers resistance to lidocaine toxicity.

N2  - Current standard treatments for patients with metastatic (stage IV) renal cell carcinoma involve both surgical removal of tumors and treatment with biological agents such as interleukin 2 or IFN-alpha. Unfortunately, such approaches are inadequate for most patients with stage IV disease; the result is a median time to progression of 2 to 4 months and an overall survival of 6 to 17 months. Standard chemotherapy has been uniformly disappointing in this disorder. It is clear that new therapies are needed to approach these patients. Recently, a greater understanding of cancer genetics has led to the successful development of novel therapeutics directed against targets linked to specific types of cancer. During the past decade, researchers have identified the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene as an important tumor suppressor in clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. Elucidation of the VHL gene product (pVHL) and its regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor signaling have created a potential genetic basis for growth factor-targeted strategies in this disease. This review will focus on the potential growth factor targets in clear cell carcinoma, their relation to VHL and hypoxia-inducible factor, and the clinical challenges that face their development.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Overview of neuroendocrine neoplasms in the context of their associations with primary and secondary immunodeficiency states.RECENT FINDINGS: Malignancies of neuroendocrine origin are well known to be associated with hereditary syndromes, including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis. This review includes the X-linked form of hyper-IgM syndrome (XHIGM), due to mutations in the CD40Ligand gene (CD40LG), as an additional inherited disorder with susceptibility to such malignancies, and discusses neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) arising in other immunocompromised states. Of all primary immune deficiency diseases, NETs appear to be unique to XHIGM patients. Outcomes for XHIGM patients with NETs is poor, and the mechanism behind this association remains unclear. In secondary immune deficiency states, NET occurrences were primarily in patients with HIV or AIDS, the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus and solid organ transplant recipients. Gastroenteropancreatic NETs were most frequent in XHIGM patients, whereas nongastroenteropancreatic-NETs, like Merkel cell carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma, affected HIV/AIDS patients. Possible mechanisms as to the nature of these associations are discussed, including chronic infections and inflammation, and CD40-CD40L interactions. Many questions remain, and further studies are needed to clarify the predisposition of patients with XHIGM to the development of NETs. Given that many of these patients present late in their disease state and have poor outcomes, it is imperative to keep a high index of suspicion at the advent of early signs and symptoms. Regular monitoring with laboratory or imaging studies, including tumor markers, may be warranted, for which further studies are needed.SUMMARY: Of all primary immunodeficiency diseases, NETs appear to be unique to XHIGM, and the mechanism behind this association remains unclear. Outcome for XHIGM patients with NETs is poor, and it is imperative to keep a high index of suspicion at the advent of early signs and symptoms.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mRNA expression and jade family PHD finger 1 (Jade-1) gene expression in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Another aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of these two genes with clinicalpathological features of the RCC patients.METHODS: A total of 75 RCC patients who received surgically therapy in our hospital were included. All patients had complete pathological data. The expression of VHL/Jade-1 was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).RESULTS: VHL and Jade-1 were both obviously downregulated in RCC tissues than that of the matched normal tissues, and both negatively correlated with tumor size as well as tumor grade. And we found a fine association of VHL gene expression with Jade-1.CONCLUSION: VHL/Jade-1 exhibited significantly decreased expression in RCC tissues and was closely related to the clinical prognosis of patients. The finding of VHL expression positively correlated with Jade-1 expression shed light and provided crucial evidence on the connection of VHL protein with Wnt/b-catenin pathway.

N2  - Intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is an inherent process of tumor development that has received much attention in previous years, as it has become a major obstacle for the success of targeted therapies. ITH is also temporally unpredictable across tumor evolution, which makes its precise characterization even more problematic since detection success depends on the precise temporal snapshot at which ITH is analyzed. New and more efficient strategies for tumor sampling are needed to overcome these difficulties which currently rely entirely on the pathologist's interpretation. Recently, we showed that a new strategy, the multisite tumor sampling, works better than the routine sampling protocol for the ITH detection when the tumor time evolution was not taken into consideration. Here, we extend this work and compare the ITH detections of multisite tumor sampling and routine sampling protocols across tumor time evolution, and in particular, we provide in silico analyses of both strategies at early and late temporal stages for four different models of tumor evolution (linear, branched, neutral, and punctuated). Our results indicate that multisite tumor sampling outperforms routine protocols in detecting ITH at all different temporal stages of tumor evolution. We conclude that multisite tumor sampling is more advantageous than routine protocols in detecting intratumor heterogeneity. Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland.

N2  - A growing body of evidence suggests a role of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene in the progression of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Our previous study of VHL in PTCs showed that lower VHL expression was associated with aggressive tumor features, but we found no evidence for VHL downregulation through common genetic or epigenetic modifications. Several studies pointed to a role of microRNA-92a (miR-92a) in the regulation of VHL expression in different cancers. In the present study, we examined the expression levels of VHL mRNA and miR-92a in 42 pairs of PTCs and matched non-tumor thyroid tissues by means of quantitative RT-PCR. We explored the correlation between them and their association with clinicopathological parameters. The results revealed that both VHL and miR-92a were either up- or downregulated in PTCs compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues. On univariate analysis, lower VHL levels were significantly associated with extrathyroid spread (P = 0.022) and capsular invasion (P = 0.032). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of low VHL with extrathyroid spread (OR 0.246, 95% CI 0.069-0.872, P = 0.038). Higher miR-92a among PTC tissues associated with the presence of nodal metastases (univariate analysis: P = 0.012; multivariate: OR 4.703, 95% CI 1.109-19.938, P = 0.036). A negative correlation between VHL and miR-92a was observed in a subgroup of PTCs having vascular invasion (P = 0.033, r = - 0.673). The data here reported demonstrate that the expression of both VHL and miR-92a is deregulated in PTC tissues and that in some PTCs they may have opposite roles. These roles, as well as their diagnostic and/or prognostic utility, remain to be clarified.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) functions to induce neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) and skin-derived precursors (SKPs). Here we identified a neuronal differentiation domain (NDD) in pVHL. Neuronal differentiation of SKPs was induced by intracellular delivery of a peptide composed of the amino-acid sequences encoded by the NDD. Neuronal differentiation mediated by the NDD was caused by the binding between it and elongin C followed by Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) ubiquitination of JAK2 and inhibition of the JAK2/the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3(STAT)3 pathway. The NDD in pVHL contained the BC-box motif ((A,P,S,T)LXXX (A,C) XXX(A,I,L,V)) corresponding to the binding site of elongin C. Therefore, we proposed that other BC-box proteins might also contain an NDD; and subsequently also identified in them an NDD containing the amino-acid sequence encoded by the BC-box motif in BC-box proteins. Furthermore, we showed that different NDD peptide-delivered cells differentiated into different kinds of neuron-like cells. That is, dopaminergic neuron-like cells, cholinergic neuron-like cells, GABAnergic neuron-like cells or rhodopsin-positive neuron-like cells were induced by different NDD peptides. These novel findings might contribute to the development of a new method for promoting neuronal differentiation and shed further light on the mechanism of neuronal differentiation of somatic stem cells.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1), and mutations in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Additionally, in about 40% of ccRCC cases the mutation in PBRM1 (POLYBROMO1) gene coding for a non-core subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex was found suggesting potential impairment of this complex function in ccRCC. In this study we assessed the extent to which the core SWI/SNF complex subunit - INI1 (hSNF5/SMARCB1) is affected in ccRCC and whether it has any consequences on the development of this type of cancer. The evaluation of INI1 protein level in samples from 50 patients with diagnosed ccRCC, including three displaying rhabdoid features, showed the INI1 positive staining in rhabdoid cells while the conventional ccRCC cells exhibited reduced INI1 level. This indicated the rhabdoid component of ccRCC as distinct from other known rhabdoid tumors. The reduced INI1 protein level observed in all conventional ccRCC cases used in this study correlated with decreased SMARCB1 gene expression at the transcript level. Consistently, the overexpression of INI1 protein in A498 ccRCC cell line resulted in the elevation of endogenous SMARCB1 transcript level indicating that the INI1-dependent regulatory feedback loop controlling expression of this gene is affected in ccRCC Moreover, the set of INI1 target genes including i.e. CXCL12/CXCR7/CXCR4 chemokine axis was identified to be affected in ccRCC. In summary, we demonstrated that the inactivation of INI1 may be of high importance for ccRCC development and aggressiveness.

N2  - Introduction: Germline mutations in the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene result in VHL disease, which puts patients at high risk for developing characteristic neoplasias such as pheochromocytomas, hemangioblastomas, and renal cell carcinomas. Molecularly, the VHL protein plays a pivotal role in the VHL/HIF axis, disruption of which has been reported to contribute to tumor progression via immunomodulatory mechanisms. However, most reports have focused on T cell function and the tumor microenvironment. Using CD40 activated B cells (CD40B) as an in vitro model for B cell activation, we aimed at elucidating phenotypical and functional characteristics of activated B cells in this patient collective. Methods: Primary blood cells from 15 individuals with VHL disease were obtained. B cells were isolated and activated with soluble CD40L. Immune phenotyping was carried out using flow cytometry, and phosphorylation profiles of CD40 signaling pathway molecules were analyzed with the phosphoflow assay. 5-day allogenic mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) were performed with CD40B cells as antigen presenting cells and CD3+ T cells as responder cells. Results: After 4 days of CD40 stimulation, expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in VHL B cells was attenuated by 46% and 59%, respectively. Hypophosphorylation of CD40 signaling proteins pAKT, pERK1/2, pNFkB, and pp38 was evident in VHL B cells when compared to healthy controls. In allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction experiments, VHL CD40B cells triggered significantly less T cell activation and proliferation in both CD4+ (63%, 28%) and CD8+ (56%, 28% at B:T ratios 1:1, 1:5, respectively; relative to healthy CD40B cells) subsets. No association between the degree of phenotypical and functional alteration and clinical VHL subtype was observed. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that mutations in the VHL gene confer a significantly less immunostimulatory phenotype to B cells upon CD40-mediated activation. Impaired immune function of these cells might contribute to the increased incidence of neoplasms in VHL disease patients. Further investigation focusing on this patient collective might provide new aspects to tumorigenesis and immunotherapy.

N2  - Introduction AND Objective: Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma (MCRCC) is a very rare low-grade renal tumour with unique morphologic features and excellent prognosis. It was accepted as a separate entity in International Society of Urological Pathology-Vancouver Classification of Renal Neoplasia and the 2016 World Health Organization Classification. In the process of reshaping the classification of renal tumors Multilocular cystic renal cell neoplasm of low malignant potential is defined as an entirely cystic tumor, composed of cells with clear cytoplasm lining the cysts and small aggregates of similar cells within the cyst walls. By definition, a solid, mass-forming component is absent. This entity shared genetic pathways with usual clear cell renal cell carcinoma, such as chromosome 3p loss and mutation of the VHL gene but no report of aggressive behavior has been described. So these indolent lesions are reclassified as neoplasms of low malignant potential rather than carcinomas. METHODS: All the cases of Renal cell carcinoma reported in the last 5 years in our Institute are revisited to look for features of multilocular cystic clear cell renal neoplasm of low malignant potential with specific interest on Multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma. RESULTS: All the cases which are reclassified as multilocular cystic clear cell renal neoplasm of low malignant potential are replanned for Follow up. CONCLUSIONS: The subtle differences in 'clear cell' appearance may not uniformly have the same potential for progression and metastasis, warranting classification as benign neoplasms or tumors of low malignant potential. There are many other indolent malignancies of the kidney which may require reclassification. All these may translate to Active Surveillance and Non-Surgical management.

N2  - RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) acts as a damage sensor for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and undergoes proteolytic clearance from damaged chromatin by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here, we report that Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a druggable oncotarget, is essential for RNAPII's proteolytic clearance in mammalian cells. We show that inhibition of VCP/p97, or siRNA-mediated ablation of VCP/p97 and its cofactors UFD1 and UBXD7 severely impairs ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced RNAPII degradation. VCP/p97 interacts with RNAPII, and the interaction is enhanced by Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB). However, the VCP/p97-mediated RNAPII proteolysis occurs independent of CSB. Surprisingly, CSB enhances UVR-induced RNAPII ubiquitination but delays its turnover. Additionally, VCP/p97-mediated RNAPII turnover occurs with and without Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), a known substrate receptor of Elongin E3 ubiquitin ligase for RNAPII. Moreover, pVHL re-expression improves cell viability following UVR. Whereas, VCP/p97 inhibition decreases cell viability and enhances a low-dose UVR killing in presence of pVHL. These findings reveal a function of VCP/p97 segregase in UVR-induced RNAPII degradation in mammalian cells, and suggest a role of CSB in coordinating VCP/p97-mediated extraction of ubiquitinated RNAPII and CSB itself from chromatin.

N2  - The alpha-subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha) promote transcription of genes that regulate glycolysis and cell survival and growth. Sprouty2 (Spry2) is a modulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and inhibits cell proliferation by a number of different mechanisms. Because of the seemingly opposite actions of HIFalpha subunits and Spry2 on cellular processes, we investigated whether Spry2 regulates the levels of HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha proteins. In cell lines from different types of tumors in which the decreased protein levels of Spry2 have been associated with poor prognosis, silencing of Spry2 elevated HIF1alpha protein levels. Increases in HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha protein levels due to silencing of Spry2 also up-regulated HIFalpha target genes. Using HIF1alpha as a prototype, we show that Spry2 decreases HIF1alpha stability and enhances the ubiquitylation of HIF1alpha by a von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL)-dependent mechanism. Spry2 also exists in a complex with HIF1alpha. Because Spry2 can also associate with pVHL, using a mutant form of Spry2 (3P/3A-Spry2) that binds HIF1alpha, but not pVHL, we show that WT-Spry2, but not the 3P/3A-Spry2 decreases HIF1alpha protein levels. In accordance, expression of WT-Spry2, but not 3P/3A-Spry2 results in a decrease in HIF1alpha-sensitive glucose uptake. Together our data suggest that Spry2 acts as a scaffold to bring more pVHL/associated E3 ligase in proximity of HIF1alpha and increase its ubiquitylation and degradation. This represents a novel action for Spry2 in modulating biological processes regulated by HIFalpha subunits.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Obliterative bronchiolitis after lung transplantation is characterized by chronic airway inflammation leading to the obliteration of small airways. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a master regulator of cellular responses to hypoxia and inflammation. The Von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) drives the degradation of oxygen-sensitive subunit HIF-1alpha that controls the activity of HIF-1. We investigated the effect of myeloid cell-targeted gene deletion of HIF-1alpha or its negative regulator pVHL on the development of obliterative airway disease (OAD) in the recipients of tracheal allografts, a mouse model for obliterative bronchiolitis after lung transplantation.METHODS: Tracheal allografts were heterotopically transplanted from BALB/c donor mice to fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched recipient mice with HIF-1alpha or VHL gene deletion in myeloid cells. The recipients were left non-immunosuppressed or received tacrolimus daily. Histologic, immunohistochemical, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed at 3, 10, and 30 days.RESULTS: In the absence of immunosuppression, myeloid cell-specific VHL deficiency of the recipient mice improved epithelial recovery, decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased regulatory forkhead box P3 messenger RNA expression, and reduced OAD development in tracheal allografts. In the presence of tacrolimus immunosuppression, loss of HIF-1alpha activity in myeloid cells of the recipient by HIF-1alpha gene deletion accelerated OAD development in mouse tracheal allografts.CONCLUSIONS: Activity of the HIF-pathway affects the development of allograft rejection, and our results suggest that myeloid cell-specific VHL-deficiency that potentially increases HIF-activity decreases allograft inflammation and the subsequent development of OAD in mouse tracheal allografts.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Factors associated with malignancy in patients with pheochromocytoma (adrenal tumors, Pheo) and paraganglioma (extra-adrenal, PGL) are not well-defined and all patients require lifelong surveillance. The primary aim of our study was to determine genetic and clinical variables associated with malignancy in patients with Pheo/PGL. Methods: Single institution retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent surgery (1/95-1/15) for Pheo/PGL. Malignancy was defined as histology-confirmed distant metastasis, lymph nodal involvement, or tumor bed recurrence. Results: A total of 157 Pheo/PGL patients (44 malignant, 113 benign) with mean follow-up of 87 months were included. Compared with patients with benign Pheo/PGL, patients with malignant Pheo/PGL were younger (median 42 vs 50 years, p = 0.014), had larger tumors (median 6.5 vs 4 cm, p < 0.001) and had PGL (63.6 vs 4.4%, p < 0.001). Genetic testing was performed in 60 patients and was positive in 38 (63%). Although positive genetic results were equally likely in malignant vs benign Pheo/PGL (76 vs 54%, p = 0.1), all 11 patients with germline SDHB mutations had malignant disease. In multivariable analysis, younger age, larger tumor size, and PGL were associated with malignancy (p < 0.05). Pheo patients with negative genetic testing and negative family history who developed metachronous metastases all had primary tumors >=4 cm in size. Conclusions: Patients who are young, have larger tumors, positive genetic testing (especially SDHB) or have PGL require long-term follow-up. Patients with negative genetic testing or family history and Pheo <4 cm have a lower risk of malignancy, and de-escalated long-term surveillance may be appropriate follow-up.

N2  - RATIONALE: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare inherited, autosomal-dominant syndrome caused by heterozygous germline mutations in the VHL gene. VHL patients are prone to develop benign and malignant tumors and cysts in multiple organ systems involving kidneys, pancreas and central nervous system (CNS). The varied and complex clinical manifestations and radiological findings of VHL are of interest.PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a 38-year-old woman with a ten-year history of VHL disease involving both pancreas and biliary system. To the best of our knowledge, direct involvement of the biliary system in VHL disease has never been reported.DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis was established via computed tomography scan and was confirmed by genetic testing.INTERVENTIONS: The patient chose to receive conservative treatment and was followed up by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance imaging examination.OUTCOMES: Renal angiomas and cysts were found during follow-up and there were no evidence of malignant change of the pancreas and biliary system.LESSONS: We described the first case of VHL-associated choledochal cysts and may present new visceral manifestations of VHL disease. Gastroenterologists should be aware of the clinical presentations of this rare disease for early detection of its life-threatening manifestations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer. Although ccRCC is characterized by common recurrent genetic abnormalities, including inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (vhl) tumor suppressor gene resulting in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the tumor aggressiveness and outcome of ccRCC is variable. New biomarkers are thus required to improve ccRCC diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic options. This work aims to investigate the expression of HIF and proteins involved in metabolism and pH regulation. Their correlation to histoprognostic parameters and survival was analyzed.METHODS: ccRCC of 45 patients were analyzed. HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, HAF, GLUT1, MCT1, MCT4, CAIX and CAXII expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a semi-quantitative and qualitative manner. The GLUT1, MCT1, MCT4, CAIX and CAXII mRNA levels were analyzed in an independent cohort of 43 patients.RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between increased GLUT1, MCT1, CAXII protein expression and a high Fuhrman grade in ccRCC patients. Moreover, while HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and HAF expression was heterogenous within tumors, we observed and confirmed that HIF-2alpha co-localized with HAF. We confirmed, in an independent cohort, that GLUT1, MCT1 and CAXII mRNA levels correlated with the Fuhrman grade. Moreover, we demonstrated that the high mRNA level of both MCT1 and GLUT1 correlated with poor prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time a link between the aggressiveness of high- Fuhrman grade ccRCC and metabolic reprogramming. It also confirms the role of HIF-2alpha and HAF in tumor invasiveness. Finally, these results demonstrate that MCT1 and GLUT1 are strong prognostic markers and promising therapeutic targets.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) are highly metastatic tumors with metastases detected at diagnosis (synchronous) or during follow-up (metachronous). To date, there have been no reports comparing primary ccRCC of patients with synchronous and metachronous metastases, who are different in terms of prognosis. Determining whether there is a phenotypic difference between these 2 groups could have important clinical implications.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective consecutive cohort of 98 patients with ccRCC, 48 patients had metastases, including 28 synchronous and 20 metachronous presentations, with a follow-up of 10 years. For each primary tumor in these metastatic patients, pathologic criteria, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, partitioning-defective 3, CAIX, and programmed death ligand 1 as detected by immunohistochemistry, and complete VHL status were analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed, and survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves compared by log-rank test.RESULTS: Compared with primary ccRCC in patients with metachronous metastases, primary ccRCC in patients with synchronous metastases were significantly associated with a poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance (P = .045), higher pT status (P = .038), non-inactivated VHL gene (P = .01), sarcomatoid component (P = .007), expression of partitioning-defective 3 (P = .007), and overexpressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (> 50%) (P = .017) and programmed death ligand 1 (P = .019). Patients with synchronous metastases had a worse cancer-specific survival than patients with metachronous metastases even from metastatic diagnosis (median survival, 16 months vs. 46 months, respectively; P = .01).CONCLUSION: This long-term study is the first to support the notion that synchronous m-ccRCC has a distinct phenotype. This is probably linked to the occurrence of oncogenic events that could explain the worse prognosis. These particular patients with metastases could benefit from specific therapy.

N2  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Due to its association with an assortment of diseases, miRNAs have been extensively studied in the last decade. In this review, the current understanding of the role of miRNAs in the pathophysiology of adrenal tumors is discussed. The recent contributions of high-throughput miRNA profiling studies have identified miRNAs that have functional and molecular roles in adrenal tumorigenesis. With respect to the biological heterogeneity of adrenal tumors and the limitations of the current treatments, an improved understanding of miRNAs may hold potential diagnostic and therapeutic value to facilitate better clinical management.

N2  - In this study, we report here a rare case of polycythemia and cRCC in the same patient, which may be helpful in understanding clinical features and molecular mechanisms underlying VHL-mutation-associated cRCC and polycythemia induced by germline mutation of HIF2A. Firstly, we identified a rare but well studied germline mutation resulting in polycythemia in HIF2A (c.1609G>A, p.Gly537Trp) in the blood of the patient and his daughter. Meanwhile, we identified an inactivating VHL mutation (c.391A>T, p.N131Y), as well as TP53 mutation(c.977A>T, p.E326V) and mTOR mutation(c.7498A>T, p.I2500F) in renal cancer tissue. Moreover, protein levels of VHL, HIF1A, HIF2A, EPO, and VEGF estimated by immunohistochemical staining substantiated hyperactivation of the oxygen-sensing pathway. In addition, we identified 158 somatic SNP/indel mutations, including 90 missense/nonsense/splice/stop-loss mutations by whole-exome sequencing (WES) of the tumor specimen and matched normal DNA.

    2 patients with VHL alterations --? do not provide the exact mutation
N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recently reported evidence-based guidelines for the management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts. These guidelines advocate a higher threshold for surgical resection than prior guidelines and imaging surveillance for a considerable number of patients with pancreatic cysts. The aims of this study were to assess the accuracy of the AGA guidelines in detecting advanced neoplasia and present an alternative approach to pancreatic cysts.METHODS: The study population consisted of 225 patients who underwent EUS-guided FNA for pancreatic cysts between January 2014 and May 2015. For each patient, clinical findings, EUS features, cytopathology results, carcinoembryonic antigen analysis, and molecular testing of pancreatic cyst fluid were reviewed. Molecular testing included the assessment of hotspot mutations and deletions for KRAS, GNAS, VHL, TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN.RESULTS: Diagnostic pathology results were available for 41 patients (18%), with 13 (6%) harboring advanced neoplasia. Among these cases, the AGA guidelines identified advanced neoplasia with 62% sensitivity, 79% specificity, 57% positive predictive value, and 82% negative predictive value. Moreover, the AGA guidelines missed 45% of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia. For cases without confirmatory pathology, 27 of 184 patients (15%) with serous cystadenomas (SCAs) based on EUS findings and/or VHL alterations would continue magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance. In comparison, a novel algorithmic pathway using molecular testing of pancreatic cyst fluid detected advanced neoplasias with 100% sensitivity, 90% specificity, 79% positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value.CONCLUSIONS: The AGA guidelines were inaccurate in detecting pancreatic cysts with advanced neoplasia. Furthermore, because the AGA guidelines manage all neoplastic cysts similarly, patients with SCAs will continue to undergo unnecessary MRI surveillance. The results of an alternative approach with integrative molecular testing are encouraging but require further validation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs) are, with a prevalence of up to 16%, a component of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Data from international registries regarding heritable fraction and characteristics, germline VHL mutation frequency, and prevalence are lacking.METHODS: Systematic registration of ELSTs from international centers of otorhinolaryngology and from multidisciplinary VHL centers' registries was performed. Molecular genetic analyses of the VHL gene were offered to all patients.RESULTS: Our population-based registry comprised 93 patients with ELST and 1789 patients with VHL. The prevalence of VHL germline mutations in apparently sporadic ELSTs was 39%. The prevalence of ELSTs in patients with VHL was 3.6%. ELST was the initial manifestation in 32% of patients with VHL-ELST.CONCLUSION: Prevalence of ELST in VHL disease is much lower compared to the literature. VHL-associated ELSTs can be the first presentation of the syndrome and mimic sporadic tumors, thus emphasizing the need of molecular testing in all presentations of ELST. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Central nervous system hemangioblastomas (CNS-HBs) occur sporadically or as a component of von Hippel-Lindau-VHL syndrome. CNS-HBs share some molecular similarities with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PPGLs) and renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Recently, hypoxia-inducible factors, particularly somatic HIF2A mutations, have been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of PPGLs. Somatic mutations in HIF2A have been reported in PPGLs associated with polycythemia, which have been reported to also be present in patients with RCCs and HBs. However, whether CNS-HBs is associated with the presence of a HIF2A mutation is currently uknown. We analyzed somatic HIF2A and VHL mutations in a series of 28 sporadic CNS-HBs. We also investigated the expression of HIF target proteins and hypoxia-associated factor (HAF). Two sporadic CNS-HBs were found to have somatic HIF2A mutations. One tumor had 2 HIF2A missense mutations, one of which was previously described in a PPGL (c.1121 T>A, F374Y). The second patient had coexistence of somatic truncated mutations (c.1669 C>T, Q557*) in HIF2A together with a VHL mutation. Neither of the two patients had polycythemia at the time of diagnosis. We demonstrate that the novel truncated mutation in HIF2A (Q557*) affects HIF-2alpha prolyl hydroxylation with its reduced ubiquitination but intact transcriptional activity, resulting in an activating effect. Both CNS-HB samples showed positive expression of VEGFR2/CA9/Glut1 and HAF. Our data support the unique central role of the VHL/HIF-2alpha signaling pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of CNS-HBs and show for the first time the presence of HIF2A mutations in sporadic HB.

N2  - Missense mutations in the VHL gene during sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma were studied to evaluate their localization in relation to functionally important motifs of the VHL protein. Somatic mutations were identified in 124 of 307 samples. All missense mutations in the alpha-domain were localized in the binding site for elongin C. Substitutions in the beta-domain (77%) were found in the HIF-binding site. Five missense mutations were absent in these sites, which illustrates their role in VHL protein formation or suppressor function of other protein cofactors. Mutation c.392A->T (p.N131I) was identified for the first time. Our results hold much promise to estimate the boundaries of functionally important sites in the VHL suppressor gene and contribute to the interpretation of a pathogenic role of mutations in direct DNA diagnostics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder that confers a lifelong risk for developing both benign and malignant tumours in multiple organs. Recent evidence suggests that vHL may exhibit genetic anticipation (GA). The aim of this study was to determine if GA occurs in vHL, and if telomere shortening may be a factor in GA.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of vHL families seen at The Hospital for Sick Children between 1984 and 2016 was performed. Age of onset (AOO, defined as the age of first physician-diagnosed vHL-related manifestation) was confirmed for 96 patients from 20 unrelated families (80 clinically affected and 16 unaffected carriers). Flow-FISH(flow cytometry sorting of cells whose telomeres are labeled by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) was used to measure mean telomere length of six white blood cell subtypes from 14 known VHL pathogenic variant carriers.RESULTS: The median AOO for generations I, II and III were 32.5, 22.5 and 12.0 years, respectively. The differences in the AOO between generations were highly significant using a Cox proportional hazards model (P=6.00x10<sup>-12</sup>). Telomere lengths were significantly different for granulocytes and natural killer lymphocytes of patients with vHL compared with age-matched controls. For six vHL parent-child pairs, median white blood cell telomere lengths between parent and child were not significantly different.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vHL telomere abnormalities may be primarily somatic in origin rather than a cause of GA. As tumour development exhibits GA in our cohort, vHL surveillance guidelines may need to account for a patient's generational position within a vHL pedigree.

N2  - Renal cell cancer (RCC) is the common denominator for a heterogeneous group of diseases. The subclassification of these tumours is based on histological type and molecular pathogenesis. Insight into molecular pathogenesis has led to the development of targeted systemic therapies. Genetic susceptibility is the principal cause of RCC in about 2-4% of cases. Hereditary RCC is the umbrella term for about a dozen different conditions, the most frequent of which is von Hippel-Lindau disease . Here, we describe the main hereditary RCC syndromes, consider criteria for referral of RCC patients for clinical genetic assessment and discuss management options for patients with hereditary RCC and their at-risk relatives.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has a poor prognosis with a 50% risk of metastases. Little is known about the phenotypic and molecular profiles of metastases regarding their corresponding primary tumors. This study aimed to screen phenotypic and genotypic differences between metastases and their corresponding primary tumors. We selected four cases with available frozen material. The histological, immunohistochemical (VEGFA, CD31, SMA, Ki67, p53, PAR-3), FISH (VHL gene), next-generation sequencing (VHL and c-MET genes), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and array-(comparative genomic hybridization) CGH analyses were realized. Metastases were nodal, hepatic (synchronous), adrenal, and pulmonary (metachronous). High-grade tumor cells were significantly more frequent in metastases (p = 0.019). Metastases and high-grade zones of primary tumors shared similar characteristics compared to low-grade zones: a lower microscopic vascular density (43.5 vs 382.5 vessels/mm<sup>2</sup>; p = 0.0027), a higher expression of VEGF (73 vs 10%, p = 0.045), Ki67 (37.6 vs 8.3%; p = 0.011), and p53 (54 vs 10.6%; p = 0.081), and a cytoplasmic and membranous PAR-3 staining. Metastases exhibited more chromosomal imbalances than primary tumors in total (18.75 +/- 6.8; p = 0.044) with more genomic gains (13.5 +/- 7; p = 0.013). The loss of chromosome 9 and gain of Xq were found in both primary tumors and metastases but gains of loci or chromosomes 2p, 3q, 5, 8q, 12, and 20 were only found in metastases. The VHL gene status was similar in each tumor couple. Although metastases and primary tumors share common histological features, this study highlights chromosomal differences specific to metastases which could be involved in ccRCC metastatic evolution.

N2  - The most common hereditary gynaecological tumour syndromes are hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome. However, pathologists also may encounter gynaecological tumours in women with rare hereditary syndromes. Many of these tumours exhibit distinctive gross and microscopic features that are associated with a risk for an inherited gene mutation. The sensitivity and specificity of these tumour pathology features for predicting an inherited mutation vary depending on the syndrome. By recognising these tumour features, pathologists may potentially contribute to the diagnosis of an unsuspected syndrome by recommending referral of the patient for formal risk assessment by genetic counselling. Patients additionally benefit from diagnosis of an inherited syndrome because many also carry a lifetime risk for developing primary malignancies outside of the gynaecological tract. Early diagnosis of an inherited syndrome permits early screening, detection, and management of additional malignancies associated with the syndrome. This review highlights these rare syndromes and their tumour pathology, including Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (gastric type mucinous carcinoma of the cervix; ovarian sex cord tumour with annular tubules); hereditary leiomyoma renal cell carcinoma syndrome (uterine leiomyoma); tuberous sclerosis complex (uterine PEComa; uterine lymphangioleiomyomatosis); DICER1 syndrome (ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour; cervical embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma); rhabdoid tumour predisposition syndrome 2 (small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcaemic type); Cowden syndrome (endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma); naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (ovarian fibroma); and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the broad ligament).

N1  - 7th Symposium of the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons: Surgery for Subclinical Endocrine Disease. United Kingdom
N2  - Introduction: Paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas are relatively rare tumours of neuroectodermal origin arising from chromaffin cells. Paragangliomas constitutes 15% of adults and 30%of paediatric pheochromocytomas, they can be found along the paravertebral and para-aortic axes. Approximately 85% of paragangliomas are intra-abdominal and adjacent to the adrenal, whereas fewer than 15% are intrathoracic and 1- 3% is cervical. The majority occur as sporadic tumours; however up to 25% of cases are familial. Familial paragangliomas have been well described in carriers of mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene encoding subunits B, C and D. Familial syndromes include von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis, Sturge- Weber syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2. However, a particular MAX genetic variant has never been reported in patients with paragangliomas/ phaeochromocytoma. Method: Between 2011 and 2016, fifty-three laparoscopic/ open adrenalectomies were performed on patients aged between 24 and 77. The indications were: pheochromocytoma, Conn's syndrome, MEN Type 1 syndrome, B-cell lymphoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, ganglioneuroma and Cushing's syndrome. Clinical data was collected from baseline biochemical screening tests, radiological evidence and histology results. Discussion: Two patients were identified to have paraganglioma. We present clinical presentation, radiological diagnosis, histopathological finding, underlying genetic mutation and surgical management. The sizes of the specimens were 40mm and 70mm. In both cases, the 24 hour urine catecholamine was raised. However, only one patient had a positive MIBG iodine 123 scan. Mutation analysis has revealed the genotype c.298C>T MAX gene in one patient, this particular genetic variant has never been reported in patients with paraganglioma. The MAX gene is detected 1 in 120,000 apparently normal individuals, this variant result in a significant amino acid exchange in a highly conserved part of the MAX gene. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first case report in the English literature describing the c.298C>TMAX mutation causing paraganglioma. A multi-disciplinary approach is highly recommended involving the geneticist, endocrinologist and surgeon in managing such a rare tumour.

N2  - The canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is up-regulated in gliomas and involved in proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Nuclear beta-catenin accumulation correlates with malignancy. Hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha by inhibiting HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation, which promotes glycolytic energy metabolism, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, whereas HIF-1alpha is degraded by the HIF prolyl hydroxylase under normoxic conditions. We focus this review on the links between the activated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and the mechanisms underlying vasculogenesis and angiogenesis through HIF-1alpha under normoxic conditions in gliomas. Wnt-induced epidermal growth factor receptor/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, Wnt-induced signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, and Wnt/beta-catenin target gene transduction (c-Myc) can activate HIF-1alpha in a hypoxia-independent manner. The PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway activates HIF-1alpha through eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and STAT3. The beta-catenin/T-cell factor 4 complex directly binds to STAT3 and activates HIF-1alpha, which up-regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc in a positive feedback loop. Phosphorylated STAT3 by interleukin-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor activates HIF-1alpha even under normoxic conditions. The activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway induces, via the Wnt target genes c-Myc and cyclin D1 or via HIF-1alpha, gene transactivation encoding aerobic glycolysis enzymes, such as glucose transporter, hexokinase 2, pyruvate kinase M2, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase-A, leading to lactate production, as the primary alternative of ATP, at all oxygen levels, even in normoxic conditions. Lactate released by glioma cells via the monocarboxylate lactate transporter-1 up-regulated by HIF-1alpha and lactate anion activates HIF-1alpha in normoxic endothelial cells by inhibiting HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation and preventing HIF labeling by the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Increased lactate with acid environment and HIF-1alpha overexpression induce the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis under normoxic conditions. Hypoxia and acidic pH have no synergistic effect on VEGF transcription.

N2  - How can we treat cancer more effectively? Traditionally, tumours from the same anatomical site are treated as one tumour entity. This concept has been challenged by recent breakthroughs in cancer genomics and translational research that have enabled molecular tumour profiling. The identification and validation of cancer drivers that are shared between different tumour types, spurred the new paradigm to target driver pathways across anatomical sites by off-label drug use, or within so-called basket or umbrella trials which are designed to test whether molecular alterations in one tumour entity can be extrapolated to all others. However, recent clinical and preclinical studies suggest that there are tissue-and cell type-specific differences in tumorigenesis and the organization of oncogenic signalling pathways. In this Opinion article, we focus on the molecular, cellular, systemic and environmental determinants of organ-specific tumorigenesis and the mechanisms of context-specific oncogenic signalling outputs. Investigation, recognition and in-depth biological understanding of these differences will be vital for the design of next-generation clinical trials and the implementation of molecularly guided cancer therapies in the future.

The homozygous VHL(D126N) missense mutation is associated with dramatically elevated erythropoietin levels, consequent polycythemia, and early onset severe pulmonary hypertension.


N2  - An absolute erythrocytosis is present when the red cell mass is greater than 125 % of the predicted value for sex and body mass. It can have a primary or secondary and congenital or acquired cause. New causes particularly congenital continue to be discovered and investigated. Investigation for the cause starts with repeat and confirmation of the raised hemoglobin and measurement of an erythropoietin level to indicate whether to pursue primary or secondary causes and then further investigations as appropriate. Management options include low dose aspirin and venesection. Specific management advice is available for certain specific clinical situations.

N2  - Although the pancreas is affected by only a small fraction of known inherited disorders, several of these syndromes predispose patients to pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a cancer that has a consistently dismal prognosis. Still other syndromes are associated with neuroendocrine tumors, benign cysts, or recurrent pancreatitis. Because of the variability of pancreatic manifestations and outcomes, it is important for clinicians to be familiar with several well-described genetic disorders to ensure that patients are followed appropriately. The purpose of this review was to briefly describe the hereditary syndromes that are associated with pancreatic disorders and neoplasia.

N2  - Activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is due to loss of von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) function in most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Here we describe a novel pVHL-independent mechanism of HIF regulation and identify nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) as a hitherto unknown oncogenic factor influencing human ccRCC progression. Over 60% of human ccRCCs (n=157) have negative or weak NEMO protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Moderate/strong NEMO protein expression is more frequent in VHL wild-type ccRCCs. We show that NEMO stabilizes HIFalpha via direct interaction and independently of NF-kappaB signaling in vitro. NEMO prolongs tumor cell survival via regulation of apoptosis and activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, facilitating tumor metastasis. Our findings suggest that NEMO-driven HIF activation is involved in progression of ccRCC. Therefore, NEMO may represent a clinically relevant link between NF-kappaB and the VHL/HIF pathways. Targeting NEMO with specific inhibitors in patients with metastatic ccRCC could be a novel treatment approach in patients with ccRCC expressing functional pVHL.

T1  - Small activating RNA induced expression of VHL gene in renal cell carcinoma.
A1  - Kang MR1, Park KH2, Lee CW2, Lee MY2, Han SB3, Li LC4, Kang JS5.
N2  - Recent studies have reported that chemically synthesized double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), also known as small activating RNA (saRNAs), can specifically induce gene expression by targeting promoter sequences by a mechanism termed RNA activation (RNAa). In the present study, we designed 4 candidate saRNAs targeting the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene promoter. Among these saRNAs, dsVHL-821 significantly inhibited cell growth by up-regulating VHL at both the mRNA and protein levels in renal cell carcinoma 769-P cells. Functional analysis showed that dsVHL-821 induced apoptosis by increasing p53, decreasing Bcl-xL, activating caspase 3/7 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that dsVHL-821 increased the enrichment of Ago2 and RNA polymerase II at the dsVHL-821 target site. In addition, Ago2 depletion significantly suppressed dsVHL-821-induced up-regulation of VHL gene expression and related effects. Single transfection of dsVHL-821 caused long-lasting (14 days) VHL up-regulation. Furthermore, the activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 was accompanied by an increase in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of histone 4 (H4ac) and a decrease in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2) in the dsVHL-821 target region. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dsVHL-821, a novel saRNA for VHL, induces the expression of the VHL gene by epigenetic changes, leading to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and suggest that targeted activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 may be explored as a novel treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - An important emerging role of the surgical pathologist besides the traditional tasks of establishment of the diagnosis and documentation of prognostic and predictive factors, is to recognize the possibility of a hereditary condition in cases where the histology is suggestive for a familial cancer syndrome. In recent years, the knowledge regarding all of the above roles, including the role of recognition of familial cancer, has particularly expanded in renal neoplasms with the close scrutiny to morphology, molecular correlates and clinical features of the different sub-types of renal cell carcinoma. Awareness of these clinically distinctive sub-types and their associated histologic clues will prompt the pathologist for further immunohistochemical or molecular work up, to look for clinical information to support the suspected diagnosis of familial cancer, to alert managing physician/s to look for stigmata of history of familial cancer, which will permit triaging patients and their families for appropriate genetic counseling. This review provides a comprehensive review of the known sub-types of renal cell carcinoma that have a predilection to occur in the setting of hereditary disease; examples include renal cancers occurring in the background of von Hippel Lindau disease, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Birt Hogg Dube syndrome and succinate dehydrogenase deficiency. Herein we focus on diagnostic clues for renal tumors occurring in a non-pediatric setting that should prompt their correct recognition and reiterate the importance of the correct diagnosis.

N2  - Quality control mechanisms promote aggregation and degradation of misfolded proteins. In budding yeast, the human von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL, officially known as VHL) is misfolded and forms aggregates. Here, we investigated the aggregation of three pVHL isoforms (pVHL213, pVHL160, pVHL172) in fission yeast. The full-length pVHL213 isoform aggregates in highly dynamic small puncta and in large spherical inclusions, either close to the nucleus or to the cell ends. The large inclusions contain the yeast Hsp104 chaperone. Aggregate clearance is regulated by proteasomal degradation. The pVHL160 isoform forms dense foci and large irregularly shaped aggregates. In silico, prediction of pVHL aggregation propensity identified a key aggregation-promoting region within exon 2. Consistently, the pVHL172 isoform, which lacks exon 2, formed rare reduced inclusions. We studied the aggregation propensity of pVHL variants harbouring missense mutations found in kidney carcinomas. We show that the P86L mutation stimulated small aggregate formation, the P146A mutation increased large inclusion formation, whereas the I151S mutant destabilized pVHL. The prefoldin subunit Pac10 (the human homolog VBP-1 binds to pVHL) is required for pVHL stability. Reduction of soluble functional pVHL might be crucial in VHL-related diseases.

N2  - Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is highly metastatic. Cabozantinib, an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets c-MET, provided interesting results in metastatic ccRCC treatment. Objective: To understand better the role of c-MET in ccRCC, we assessed its status in a population of patients with metastatic ccRCC. Patients and Methods: For this purpose, tumor samples were analyzed for c-MET expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), for c-MET copy number alterations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and for c-MET mutations by next generation sequencing (NGS) in a retrospective cohort of 90 primary ccRCC of patients with metastases treated by first-line sunitinib. The expression of c-MET was correlated with pathological, immunohistochemical (VEGFA, CAIX, PD-L1), clinical, and molecular criteria (VHL status) by univariate and multivariate analyses and to clinical outcome using Kaplan-Meier curves compared by log-rank test. Results: Of ccRCC, 31.1% had low c-MET expression (absent to weak intensity by IHC) versus 68.9% with high expression (moderate to strong intensity). High expression of c-MET was associated with a gain in FISH analysis (p=0.0284) without amplification. No mutations were detected in NGS. Moreover, high c-MET expression was associated with lymph node metastases (p=0.004), sarcomatoid component (p=0.029), VEGFA (p=0.037), and PD-L1 (p=0.001) overexpression, the only factor that remained independently associated (p<0.001) after logistic regression. No difference was observed in clinical outcomes. Conclusion: This study is the first to analyse c-MET status in metastatic ccRCC. The high expression of c-MET in the majority of ccRCC and its independent association with PD-L1 expression, may suggest a potential benefit from combining c-MET inhibitors and targeted immunotherapy.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary tumor disease that arises owing to germline mutations in the VHL gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 3. Patients with VHL may develop multiple benign and malignant tumors involving various organ systems, including retinal hemangioblastomas (HBs), central nervous system (CNS) HBs, endolymphatic sac tumors, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic cystadenomas, pancreatic cysts, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, renal cysts, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and epididymal and broad ligament cystadenomas. The VHL/hypoxia-inducible factor pathway is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of VHL-related tumors. The diagnosis of VHL can be made clinically when the characteristic clinical history and findings have manifested, such as the presence of two or more CNS HBs. Genetic testing for heterozygous germline VHL mutation may also be used to confirm the diagnosis of VHL. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with VHL. Familiarity with the clinical and imaging manifestations of the various VHL-related tumors is important for early detection and guiding appropriate management. The purpose of this article is to discuss the molecular cytogenetics and clinical manifestations of VHL, review the characteristic multimodality imaging features of the various VHL-related tumors affecting multiple organ systems, and discuss the latest advances in management of VHL, including current recommendations for surveillance and screening. ©RSNA, 2018 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

N2  - Somatic mutations of the BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) gene, which maps to 3p21, have been found in several tumors including malignant mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The role of BAP1 inactivation in tumor development remains unclear. It has been reported that Vhl knock-out mice did not develop RCC, but Vhl knock-out mice with single allele loss of Bap1 in nephron progenitor cells developed RCC, indicating that Bap1 inactivation may be essential in murine renal tumorigenesis. To clarify the role of BAP1 in human RCC development, we performed mutation analyses, including copy number detection of BAP1 and assessment of allelic imbalance using microsatellite polymorphisms on 3p, in 45 RCC samples derived from 45 patients without VHL or BAP1 germline mutation. Additionally, we analyzed the sequences of the VHL, PBRM1, and SETD2 genes, and examined promoter methylation of VHL. Using immunostaining, we also checked for expression of BAP1 protein, which is normally located in the nuclei. None of the RCCs had biallelic deletion of BAP1, but five (11.1%) showed a biallelic mutation (four with a sequence-level mutation with monoallelic loss and one with a biallelic sequence-level mutation); these cells were negative for nuclear BAP1 staining. These patients had worse recurrence-free survival than the patients without a biallelic mutation (p=0.046). However, there were no significant differences in worse outcome by multivariate analysis combined with age, T stage, histological subtype, infiltration and vascular invasion. In 35 RCCs (77.8%), monoallelic loss of BAP1 was accompanied by VHL biallelic mutation or VHL promoter hypermethylation. In five RCCs (11.1%), we detected 3p loss-of-heterozygosity, but the copy number of BAP1 was normal. Surprisingly, nuclear staining of BAP1 was negative in 10 out of 31 tumors (32.3%) with hemizygous normal BAP1, suggesting that haploinsufficiency may relate to RCC development.

N2  - Context: Patients with vHL disease caused by a missense VHL mutation have a more severe phenotype compared with other VHL mutation types.Objective: To define PNET aggressiveness according to VHL genotype.Design: A prospective natural history study.Setting: The NIH clinical center.Patients: Patients with vHL disease, pancreatic manifestations, and germline missense VHL gene mutation.Intervention: In silico prediction of VHL mutation using five computational prediction models. Patients with > 80% prediction for disease-causing mutations in all models (high predicted risk (HPR)) were compared with others (low predicted risk (LPR)).Main Outcome Measure: Rates of metastases, surgical intervention and disease progression.Results: 69 patients were included: 2 developed metastases, 12 required surgery, and 31 had disease progression during a median follow-up of 60 months (range 13-84). Thirteen patients were excluded for low prediction reliability. In the remaining 56 patients (45 with PNETs, 11 with pancreatic cysts), HPR group (n=13) had a higher rate of disease progression than the LPR group (n=43) in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 3.6, 95% CI 1.1-11.9, P = 0.037). The HPR group also had a higher risk of developing metastases (P = 0.015). Among patients with codon 167 hotspot mutations (n = 26), those in the HPR group had a higher risk for disease progression (P = 0.03) compared to other patients.Conclusions: Computational models for predicting the impact of missense VHL gene mutations may be used as a prognostic factor in patients with PNETs in the context of vHL disease.

N2  - Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) function in the ubiquitin proteasome system to catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 conjugating enzymes to specific substrate proteins. CRLs are large dynamic complexes and attractive drug targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors and chemical inducers of protein degradation. The atomic details of whole CRL assembly and interactions that dictate subunit specificity remain elusive. Here we present the crystal structure of a pentameric CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> complex, composed of Cul2, Rbx1, Elongin B, Elongin C, and pVHL. The structure traps a closed state of full-length Cul2 and a new pose of Rbx1 in a trajectory from closed to open conformation. We characterize hotspots and binding thermodynamics at the interface between Cul2 and pVHL-EloBC and identify mutations that contribute toward a selectivity switch for Cul2 versus Cul5 recognition. Our findings provide structural and biophysical insights into the whole Cul2 complex that could aid future drug targeting.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors and cysts. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the VHL gene results in aberrant upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and has been associated with tumor formation. Hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and retina represent the most prevalent VHL-associated tumors, but no VHL animal model has reproduced retinal capillary hemangioblastomas (RCH), the hallmark lesion of ocular VHL. Here we report our work in developing a murine model of VHL-associated RCH by conditionally inactivating Vhl in a hemangioblast population using a Scl-Cre-ERT2 transgenic mouse line. In transgenic mice carrying the conditional allele and the Scl-Cre-ERT2 allele, 64% exhibited various retinal vascular anomalies following tamoxifen induction. Affected Vhl mutant mice demonstrated retinal vascular lesions associated with prominent vasculature, anomalous capillary networks, hemorrhage, exudates, and localized fibrosis. Histological analyses showed RCH-like lesions characterized by tortuous, dilated vasculature surrounded by "tumorlet" cell cluster and isolated foamy stromal cells, which are typically associated with RCH. Fluorescein angiography suggested increased vascular permeability of the irregular retinal vasculature and hemangioblastoma-like lesions. Vhl deletion was detected in "tumorlet" cells via microdissection. Our findings provide a phenotypic recapitulation of VHL-associated RCH in a murine model that may be useful to study RCH pathogenesis and therapeutics aimed at treating ocular VHL.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is an autosomal-dominant disease characterized by the formation of various tumours and cysts in many different parts of the body. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is caused by VHL gene mutations leading to production of impaired tumor suppressor Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome protein or its complete absence.PURPOSE: To study five patients with clinically suspected Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, who were referred for molecular genetic testing.METHODS: Sanger sequencing of the coding regions of the VHL gene.RESULTS: Five clinically relevant germline mutations were detected. One of the pathogenic variants has not been previously reported. This novel mutation is a complex mutation event combining a duplication and an indel, rearranging exon 3 of the VHL gene - c. [516_517dupGTCAAGCCT; 532_542delCTGGACATCGTinsATTA], p. (Glu173Serfs*4).CONCLUSION: Overall, our results showed that the diagnosis of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome in our country is difficult most probably because of its heterogeneous clinical manifestation and insufficient knowledge on the diagnostic criteria for the disease. From genetic point of view our results add some novel data on the mutation profile of the VHL gene. In order to prove or revise the diagnosis, early genetic testing is strongly recommended in affected patients and their family members to ensure appropriate follow-up and treatment of the malignancies.

299 Chinese von Hipple-Lindau patients from 126 families, but a one page report presenting analyzed data with truncating vs missense, CHB, RCC on overall survival --&gt; extractable data not available
N2  - Introduction & Objectives: Von Hippel-Lindau(VHL)disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome which can affect multiple organs. This study aim to analyze the effect of onset age and number of involved organs on the survival of Chinese Von Hippel-Lindau patients. Materials & Methods: In this retrospective study, we recruited 299 Chinese Von Hipple-Lindau patients from 126 families. Log-Rank test and Cox regression analysis are used to access how survival was influenced by factors including onset age and involved organs. Then we use multivariate Cox regression analysis to determine which of them are independent risk factors. Results: The mean onset age was 31.3 years (range 8-68 years). Among the 299 patients, 100 patients had one organ involved, 77 patients had two organs involved, 122 patients had multiple(>2)organs involved. Log-rank test and univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that early onset age(<=30years old)(p=0.0176), central nervous system hemangioblastoma(CHB)(p=0.01) are risk factors for patients overall survival. While involvement of more than one organ(p=0.0002) and renal cell carcinoma(RCC)(p=0.0006)were protective factors for survival. We further analyze the effect of renal cell carcinoma in CHB positive patients, Again Log-rank test and univariate Cox regression analysis revealed RCC was protective for survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicates that early onset age(<=30years old) (p=0.001, HR=2.925), family history(p=0.004, HR=2.666) and mutation type (truncating mutation vs. missense mutation)(p=0.04, HR=1.712) are independent risk factors for overall survival, and the involvement of one than one organ and renal cell carcinoma are protective factors for survival. While central nervous system hemangioblastoma is a risk factor for survival of VHL patients though the effect is not statistical significant(p=0.102). Conclusions: This largest retrospective cohort study of Chinese VHL disease indicates that early onset age along with family history and mutation type are independent risk factors for survival in VHL patients. The involvement of more than one organ and renal cell carcinoma are protectants for survival. These conclusions may help future genetic consulting and clinical decision making. (Table Presented).

    Abstract in English; Article in Russian
N2  - The paper describes a case of von Hippel--Lindau-related pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and adrenal myelolipoma in a 44-year-old woman. The pancreatic tumor and a left retroperitoneal mass were removed in the women in July 2014 and May 2015. Histological examination of the pancreatic tumor revealed that the latter consisted of clear cells forming tubular and tubercular structures showing the expression of chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and cytokeratins 18 and 19 and a negative response to CD10 and RCC. The adrenal medullary mass presented as clear-cell alveolar structures with inclusions of adipose tissue mixed with erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid cells. The clear-cell component of the adrenal gland expressed neuroendocrine markers with a negative response to cytokeratins, CD10, and RCC. Molecular genetic examination yielded a signal corresponding to two copies of the VHL gene. No deletions or amplifications of the gene were detected. Cases of von Hippel--Lindau disease concurrent with adrenal pheochromocytoma and myelolipoma and simultaneous pancreatic involvement were not found in the literature.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL; E3 ubiquitin ligase gene) is frequently mutated or undetectable in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), and therefore these tumors are highly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, including adriamycin (ADM) and sunitinib. A mutation in the tumor protein p53 (TP53) also leads to chemoresistance in tumors; however, in CCRCC, TP53 is frequently functional, yet the tumors remain highly insensitive to chemotherapy. This indicates the possibility of a synergistic effect of VHL and P53 in CCRCC. The present study aimed to detect the chemosensitivity of CCRCC. The expression of VHL in the MZ1257 cell line sensitized these cells to ADM and sunitinib, and a knockdown of VHL in the ACHN cells increased their chemoresistance. To confirm that VHL and P53 are both required for chemosensitivity, VHL and P53 were co-expressed in 786-O cells. The results of the functional antagonist assay (which assessed the IC50 values, i.e. the half maximal inhibitory concentration) confirmed that VHL and P53 act in synergy to promote chemosensitivity. Cell cycle arrest was measured by propidium iodide staining following treatment with ADM or sunitinib. Further analysis indicated that co-expression of VHL and P53 inhibited cell proliferation by completely inhibiting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase, and promoted apoptosis following treatment with ADM or sunitinib. These findings demonstrated that VHL and P53 act synergistically in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in CCRCC. Overall, VHL and P53 have important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in CCRCC. Furthermore, the regulatory role of VHL is dependant on the activation P53.

N2  - The majority of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are sporadic while 10-15% are attributable to one of several familial cancer syndromes. Hereditary forms are more commonly associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type I and von Hippel Lindau Syndrome. However, patients with Tuberous sclerosis complex also have an increased incidence of PNETs. More often this has been reported in patients with TSC2 variants. In this case report, we summarize the literature regarding PNETs associated with Tuberous sclerosis complex, as well as present a case of a patient with a TSC1 variant and a PNET. This case highlights the association of TSC1 gene variants with these tumors and emphasizes the importance of considering such diagnoses in this patient population.

N2  - Mucin and mucin-like material are features of mucinous tubular and spindle renal cell carcinoma (MTS RCC) but are rarely seen in papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). We reviewed 1311 PRCC and identified 7 tumors containing extracellular and/or intracellular mucinous/mucin-like material (labeled as PRCCM). We analyzed these using morphological, histochemical, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic methods (arrayCGH, FISH). Clinical data were available for six of the seven patients (five males and one female, age range 61-78 years). Follow-up was available for four patients (2-4 years); one patient died of widespread metastases. Tumor size ranged from 3 to 5 cm (mean 3.8). Of all cases, histological architecture showed a predominantly papillary pattern. Mucin or mucin-like was extracellular in one, intracellular in three, and both intra/extracellular in three cases. All tumors were positive for AMACR, vimentin, and OSCAR, while CK7 was positive in four. Mucicarmine stain was positive in all cases, PAS in six and Alcian blue in three cases. Five tumors were positive for MUC 1, but none were positive for MUC 2, MUC 4, or MUC 6. In only four cases, genetic analysis could be performed. Gain of chromosomes 7 and 17 was found in two cases; gain of 17 only was found in one case. Loss of heterozygosity of 3p was found in one case together with polysomy of chromosomes 7 and 17. No abnormalities of VHL, fumarate dehydrogenase, and TFE3 genes were detected. We conclude that PRCCM is a rare but challenging subtype of RCC that deserves to be further studied. In all the tumors, the mucin-like material was found in those stained with mucicarmin, but other conventional and immunohistochemical stains did not reveal consistent features of a single mucin. The molecular-genetic profile of these tumors was most consistent with that of typical papillary RCC, although one case had mixed genetic features of papillary and clear RCC. PRCCM has metastatic potential, as evidenced by one case with widespread metastases. It remains to be determined whether PRCCM represents a unique tumor subtype, deserving to be distinguished from other subtypes of PRCC. Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Introduction: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant, inherited multisystem cancer syndrome involving mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. The hallmark lesion in ocular VHL disease is the retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH), a benign vascular tumor capable of causing visual loss through exudative changes. Areas covered: Combining epidemiological and clinical data with an analysis of recent treatment and outcomes literature, this review aims to update the clinician on research findings and upcoming potential therapies. We describe the clinical features of ocular VHL disease and the factors that can help prognose visual outcome in affected patients and provide a summary of current treatment modalities. Expert commentary: We provide an update on the advent of genetic testing for pathogenic mutations in the VHL gene which has enabled earlier diagnoses and more detailed prognoses in affected patients, and have opened the way to future potential treatments aimed at the downstream molecular mediators of the disease.

N2  - Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) represent a "liquid biopsy" of the tumor potentially allowing real-time monitoring of cancer biology and therapies in individual patients. The purpose of the study was to explore the applicability of a protocol for the molecular characterization of single CTCs by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in order to investigate cell heterogeneity and provide a tool for a personalized medicine approach. CTCs were enriched and enumerated by CellSearch in blood from four metastatic breast cancer patients and singularly isolated by DEPArray. Upon whole genome amplification 3-5 single CTCs per patient were analyzed by NGS for 50 cancer-related genes. We found 51 sequence variants in 25 genes. We observed inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity in the mutational status of CTCs. The highest number of somatic deleterious mutations was found in the gene TP53, whose mutation is associated with adverse prognosis in breast cancer. The discordance between the mutational status of the primary tumor and CTCs observed in 3 patients suggests that, in advanced stages of cancer, CTC characteristics are more closely linked to the dynamic modifications of the disease status. In one patient the mutational profiles of CTCs before and during treatment shared only few sequence variants. This study supports the applicability of a non-invasive approach based on the liquid biopsy in metastatic breast cancer patients which, in perspective, should allow investigating the clonal evolution of the tumor for the development of new therapeutic strategies in precision medicine.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the expression status of several proteins related to VHL gene function and its relationship with common clinicopathological parameters.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, analytical, cross-sectional study with 50 patients diagnosed with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The study analyzed VHL mutations and hypermethylation as well as protein expression of VHL, CA-IX, HIF-1alpha, VEGF, ERK1/2, and ERK5, relating them to clinical variables. A bivariate and multivariate descriptive logistical regression analysis was performed, using the presence of metastasis at diagnosis as dependent variable.RESULTS: The study identified 13 (26%) VHL mutations related to nuclear grade (P = 0.036). VHL hypermethylation was found in 20% of cases. VHL expression was associated with the presence of mutations (P = 0.013), and the absence of expression was associated with nuclear grade and the presence of metastasis (P<0.05). HIF-1alpha was negative in only 5 cases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was positive in 31 of 47 cases and was associated with Fuhrman nuclear grade, presence of metastasis, and stage (P<0.05). ERK5 expression was increased in 58% of cases and associated with the presence of metastasis and more advanced stages (P<0.05). In the logistic regression analysis, the only variable remaining in the model was VEGF expression (P = 0.014).CONCLUSIONS: VEGF has prognostic value in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and ERK5 may be a new prognostic marker in this type of tumor owing to its relationship with metastasis and more advanced stages.

N2  - Background: Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to benign and malignant tumors, including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and renal cell carcinoma. Guidelines recommend abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scans to be performed every one or two years starting in adolescence or young adulthood for screening or surveillance for these tumors. Objective: To assess radiation exposures resulting from alternative strategies of screening and surveillance by abdominal CT scans, and projecting potential cancer risks subsequent to these exposures. Methods: Organ radiation doses were estimated using a dedicated computational solution for CT dosimetry, on the basis of protocols routinely used at one U.S. cancer research center in 2012-2015. Subsequent Lifetime Attributable Risks (LARs) of cancer incidence were projected for lifelong nonsmokers, using a dedicated radiation risk assessment tool and accounting for the reduced life expectancy of individuals diagnosed with VHL. We assumed additive effects between VHL gene mutation and radiation exposures. Results: Based on a standard CT protocol, annual scans over a lifetime starting at age 15 are associated with cumulative colon doses of 1.8 Gy at age 30, 3.8 Gy at age 50. The associated LARs of cancer incidence would be 1-2% at age 50, and 11-32% at age 80. Delaying age at screening start to 21 years would reduce the projected risks to <1% at age 50 and <15% at age 80. A frequency of one scan every two years (as used for surveillance of cystic pancreatic lesions) would be associated with LARs of <1% at age 50 and <10% at age 80. The current use of a new CT protocol (dual energy virtual non-contrast CT) at the department would reduce radiation exposures and potential subsequent risks by more than 50%. Conclusion: Annual CT screening and surveillance for pancreatic and renal tumors in VHL patients can be associated with high radiation exposures. When Magnetic Resonance Imaging is not appropriate as an alternative imaging technique, delaying age at surveillance start or reducing the frequency of CT scans could significantly reduce the potential radiation-related risks, provided that these strategies remain beneficial for patients. Optimized CT protocols can also dramatically reduce radiation exposures. The present study is currently extended to confirm our dose estimates based on CT protocols against individual radiology data, and consider other genetic syndromes. Ultimately, this study should help defining surveillance strategies with optimal risk-benefit balance.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal urologic malignancy; however, the molecular events supporting RCC carcinogenesis and progression remain poorly understood. In this study, based on the analysis of gene expression profile data from human clear cell RCC (ccRCC) and the corresponding normal tissues, we discovered that Hedgehog (HH) pathway component genes GLI1 and GLI2 were significantly elevated in ccRCC. Survival analysis of a large cohort of ccRCC samples demonstrated that the expression of GLI1 and GLI2 was negatively correlated with patient overall survival. Clinical sample-based VHL mutation and cell model-based VHL manipulation studies all indicated that the activation of GLI1 and GLI2 was not affected by VHL status. Further signaling pathway dissections demonstrated that GLI1 and GLI2 were activated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, but not mediated by the canonical HH/SMO/GLI signaling. Up-regulation of GLI1 and GLI2 promoted RCC proliferation and clonogenic ability, whereas, a combination of GLIs inhibitor Gant61 and AKT inhibitor Perifosine synergistically suppressed RCC growth and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study identifies that GLI1 and GLI2 are critical for RCC carcinogenesis, and also provides an alternative therapeutic strategy for RCC. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Hemangioblastoma is usually amenable to total surgical resection, but indication for surgery can be hampered by its location, multiplicity, or repeated recurrences frequently observed in patients with von Hippel Lindau disease (VHLD). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been administered for such cases as an alternative therapeutic option with generally favorable clinical response, but the effect of SRS has not been underscored by histological examination of the treated hemangioblastoma. Here we present histology of VHLD-associated hemangioblastoma tissue resected three months after SRS because of cyst enlargement. It confirmed that hemangioblastoma cells totally disappeared after SRS with a marginal dose of 20Gy. Furthermore, Electron microscope revealed that endothelial cells of the vascular structure disappeared while maintaining the basement membranes, and leakage of intraluminal contents was observed around the structure. We showed the SRS was effective for hemangioblastoma pathologically at least with the marginal dose of 20Gy. Leakage of intraluminal contents from the damaged vascular structure losing the endothelial cells is one possible mechanism for the cyst enlargement, and it may be a reason of poor control rate of SRS for the cystic hemangioblastoma.

N2  - Alterations in von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) do not determine deregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in clear-cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Their effects on tuberous sclerosis proteins (TSC1/2) and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) expressions in sporadic ccRCC are unknown. Therefore, we analyze the impact of VHL alterations and HIF-alpha production on the expression of TSC proteins and Hsp90 in these tumors. Alterations in VHL gene region exhibited 37/47 (78.7%) tumors. Monoallelic inactivation (intragenic mutation or LOH) was found in 10 (21.3%) and biallelic inactivation (intragenic mutation plus LOH) in 27 (57.4%) ccRCCs. Tumorous expression of HIF-alpha mRNAs, HIF-alpha, Hsp90 and TSC2 were VHL independent; TSC2 was underexpressed in all tumors by immunostaining (P<0.001). Immunoblotting revealed that TSC1 production was lower in tumors with monoallelic VHL inactivation than in control (P=0.01) and tissues with biallelic VHL inactivation (P=0.019), while tumors lacking HIF-1alpha (16/47) concurrently overexpressed HIF-2alpha and underexpressed TSC1 in comparison to controls (P=0.01 for both) and HIF-1alpha positive tumors (P=0.015 and P=0.050). Significant portion of variability (56.4%) in tumor diameter was explained by oscillations in nuclear grade, and TSC1 and HIF-2alpha expression in VHL altered tumors. In conclusion, while TSC2 is broadly downregulated in sporadic ccRCC, TSC1 expression is reduced in two subsets of these tumors, those with monoallelic VHL gene inactivation and those with concurrent low HIF-1alpha and high HIF-2alpha expression. Hence, the involvement of nuclear grade, TSC1 and HIF-2alpha in the progression of VHL altered tumors, implies the interplay between pVHL and TSC1.

N2  - Carcinoid tumours arise in cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system and can develop in a number of anatomical sites including the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. There has been a move away from the use of the term carcinoid tumour to the more appropriate use of neuroendocrine tumour (NET) to highlight the potential for invasion and metastasis associated with some NETs. Although most cases are sporadic, 15-20% of cases are related to a hereditary syndrome, the most common of these being multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1). Other hereditary syndromes include the following: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), neurofibromatosis 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which are all associated with a germline mutation of the associated tumour suppressor gene and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Familial small intestinal NET (SI NET) is a recently described condition which is also inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There appears to be more than one causative gene; thus far, only the IPMK gene has been identified as a causative germline mutation. This was identified by carrying out whole-exome sequencing of germline and tumour DNA in a family with multiple members diagnosed with SI NET. Identification of NET predisposition genes in other families via these methods will allow the development of dedicated NET gene panels which can be used to screen NET patients and at-risk relatives for hereditary mutations. Close surveillance of at-risk individuals is important to detect NETs early when curative surgery can be offered and the morbidity and mortality of metastatic NETs can be avoided.

N2  - Antiangiogenic therapy is currently considered as the cornerstone of treatment in metastatic kidney cancer. A monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and several tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the VEGF receptors demonstrated, 7 years ago, to deeply impact the outcome of this tumor and became a model of integration of molecular knowledge into clinical practice. Unfortunately, no further improvement in survival has been made and 20-25 % of cases remain primary refractory to these drugs, with an overall dismal prognosis. Since biomarker predictors of activity are lacking, their development could highly help in the process of making clinical decisions when choosing the best option for every patient or prompting the inclusion in clinical trials. This unmet medical need could become even more relevant if new immunotherapy confirms its initial promising results in this pathology. In this article, we provide an insight of current state of the art regarding the prediction of antiangiogenic efficacy in kidney cancer and propose new strategies for the implementation of such markers in clinical practice.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients are commonly treated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Correlations between somatic mutations and first-line targeted therapy outcomes have not been reported on a randomized trial.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between tumor mutations and treatment outcomes in RECORD-3, a randomized trial comparing first-line everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) followed by sunitinib (VEGF inhibitor) at progression with the opposite sequence in 471 metastatic RCC patients.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Targeted sequencing of 341 cancer genes at ~540x coverage was performed on available tumor samples from 258 patients; 220 with clear cell histology (ccRCC).OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Associations between somatic mutations and median first-line progression free survival (PFS1L) and overall survival were determined in metastatic ccRCC using Cox proportional hazards models and log-rank tests.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Prevalent mutations (>= 10%) were VHL (75%), PBRM1 (46%), SETD2 (30%), BAP1 (19%), KDM5C (15%), and PTEN (12%). With first-line everolimus, PBRM1 and BAP1 mutations were associated with longer (median [95% confidence interval {CI}] 12.8 [8.1, 18.4] vs 5.5 [3.1, 8.4] mo) and shorter (median [95% CI] 4.9 [2.9, 8.1] vs 10.5 [7.3, 12.9] mo) PFS1L, respectively. With first-line sunitinib, KDM5C mutations were associated with longer PFS1L (median [95% CI] of 20.6 [12.4, 27.3] vs 8.3 [7.8, 11.0] mo). Molecular subgroups of metastatic ccRCC based on PBRM1, BAP1, and KDM5C mutations could have predictive values for patients treated with VEGF or mTOR inhibitors. Most tumor DNA was obtained from primary nephrectomy samples (94%), which could impact correlation statistics.CONCLUSIONS: PBRM1, BAP1, and KDM5C mutations impact outcomes of targeted therapies in metastatic ccRCC patients.PATIENT SUMMARY: Large-scale genomic kidney cancer studies reported novel mutations and heterogeneous features among individual tumors, which could contribute to varied clinical outcomes. We demonstrated correlations between somatic mutations and treatment outcomes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, supporting the value of genomic classification in prospective studies.

N2  - mTOR pathway inhibitors are important drugs for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, no valid predictive markers have been identified to guide treatment selection and identify patients who are sensitive to these drugs. Mutations activating the mTOR pathway have been suggested to predict response; however, their predictive value is still unclear. Here, we present the genomic and functional characterization of a patient with metastatic clear cell RCC (ccRCC) who experienced a partial response to temsirolimus after a poor response to 2 previous lines of treatment. At the time of publication, the patient was disease-free 8 years after temsirolimus treatment. Multiregion whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 3 regions of the primary tumor, 1 metastasis, and blood revealed tumor mutations in driver genes in ccRCC: a missense mutation in VHL (p.W88L), a loss-of-function mutation in BAP1 (p.E454Rfs<sup>*</sup>15), and a novel missense mutation in MTOR (p.Y1974H). The MTOR mutation was present in all tumor regions, with similar allele frequency as the VHL mutation, and in vitro functional assessment of the MTOR variant demonstrated that it increased mTORC1 activity. Consistently, immunohistochemis-try in the tumor samples demonstrated increased levels of phospho-S6. In conclusion, multiregion WES identified a novel MTOR mutation acquired early during tumor development as the event leading to a high sensitivity to temsirolimus treatment. This study supports tumor multiregion sequencing to detect truncal mutations in the mTOR pathway to identify patients sensitive to mTOR inhibitors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The VHL protein (pVHL) is a multiadaptor protein that interacts with more than 30 different binding partners involved in many oncogenic processes. About 70 % of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have VHL mutations with varying impact on pVHL function. Loss of pVHL function leads to the accumulation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF), which is targeted by current targeted treatments. In contrast to nonsense and frameshift mutations that highly likely nullify pVHL multipurpose functions, missense mutations may rather specifically influence the binding capability of pVHL to its partners. The affected pathways may offer predictive clues to therapy and response to treatment. In this study we focused on the VHL missense mutation pattern in ccRCC, and studied their potential effects on pVHL protein stability and binding partners and discussed treatment options.METHODS: We sequenced VHL in 360 sporadic ccRCC FFPE samples and compared observed and expected frequency of missense mutations in 32 different binding domains. The prediction of the impact of those mutations on protein stability and function was assessed in silico. The response to HIF-related, anti-angiogenic treatment of 30 patients with known VHL mutation status was also investigated.RESULTS: We identified 254 VHL mutations (68.3 % of the cases) including 89 missense mutations (35 %). Codons Ser65, Asn78, Ser80, Trp117 and Leu184 represented hotspots and missense mutations in Trp117 and Leu 184 were predicted to highly destabilize pVHL. About 40 % of VHL missense mutations were predicted to cause severe protein malfunction. The pVHL binding domains for HIF1AN, BCL2L11, HIF1/2alpha, RPB1, PRKCZ, aPKC-lambda/i, EEF1A1, CCT-zeta-2, and Cullin2 were preferentially affected. These binding partners are mainly acting in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis and ubiquitin ligation. There was no correlation between VHL mutation status and response to treatment.CONCLUSIONS: VHL missense mutations may exert mild, moderate or strong impact on pVHL stability. Besides the HIF binding domain, other pVHL binding sites seem to be non-randomly altered by missense mutations. In contrast to LOF mutations that affect all the different pathways normally controlled by pVHL, missense mutations may be rather appropriate for designing tailor-made treatment strategies for ccRCC.

N2  - Kidney cancer represents about 5% of all new cancer diagnoses. The most common form of kidney cancer arises from renal epithelium, named renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This entity comprises different histological and molecular subtypes. Unraveling the molecular biology and cytogenetic of RCC has enabled the development of several targeted agents that have improved treatment outcomes of these patients. This article reviews all the agents currently approved for the treatment of RCC, and discuss upcoming molecules. Mechanism of action, preclinical and clinical development and ongoing trials, are presented for each agent, providing a broad vision of the current state of targeted therapy in RCC and possible future developments.

N2  - Background Treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) typically entails mechanistically distinct agents across the first- and second-line setting. Activity of these agents may be predicated on selective pressure that modulates RCC biology. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a platform to noninvasively ascertain temporal changes in genomic profile. Objective To assess the ctDNA profile in a large cohort of mRCC patients, and to assess changes across patients receiving first-line and later lines of therapy. Design, setting, and participants We obtained the ctDNA profile in mRCC patients who received ctDNA profiling as part of routine clinical care at progression using a 73-gene Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified ctDNA platform. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Genomic alterations (GAs) were pooled for the entire cohort. A comparison of first- and postfirst-line was performed with grouping based on conventional practice patterns (first-line regimens included sunitinib, pazopanib, and bevacizumab, and postfirst-line regimens included everolimus, axitinib, cabozantinib, and nivolumab). Results and limitations ctDNA clinical results from a nationwide cohort of 220 consecutive patients with mRCC were assessed (145 men, 75 women; median age: 63 yr, interquartile range: 57-70). GAs were detected in 78.6% of patients. The most frequent GAs in the overall cohort included TP53 (35%), VHL (23%), EGFR (17%), NF1 (16%), and ARID1A (12%). Thirty-eight and 64 patients were coded as receiving first-line and later line agents, respectively. The highest disparity in GA frequencies in postfirst-line versus first-line were in TP53 (49% vs 24%), VHL (29% vs 18%), NF1 (20% vs 3%), EGFR (15% vs 8%), and PIK3CA (17% vs 8%) while ARID1A was equivalent (13% vs 11%). Restricting the analysis to later lines versus first-line vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, these differences were even more prominent, particularly for TP53 (64% vs 31%) and NF1 (29% vs 4%). Conclusions In the largest assessment of ctDNA-detected GAs prevalence in mRCC to date, the majority of patients demonstrated clinically and biologically relevant GAs. Increasing p53 and mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway (eg, NF1, PIK3CA) alterations in postfirst-line patients with first-line vascular endothelial growth factor-directed therapy may underlie mechanisms of resistance. Routine ctDNA assessment during the clinical course of mRCC patients may have therapeutic implications. Patient summary Collection of circulating tumor DNA is feasible in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and analysis of a large cohort demonstrates significant changes in circulating tumor DNA profile across patients' clinical course which may have therapeutic implications. Collection of circulating tumor DNA is feasible in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and analysis of a large cohort demonstrates significant changes in circulating tumor DNA profile across patients' clinical course which may have therapeutic implications.

N2  - Molecular alterations involving the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (including mutation, copy number, protein, or RNA) were examined across 11,219 human cancers representing 32 major types. Within specific mutated genes, frequency, mutation hotspot residues, in silico predictions, and functional assays were all informative in distinguishing the subset of genetic variants more likely to have functional relevance. Multiple oncogenic pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR converged on similar sets of downstream transcriptional targets. In addition to mutation, structural variations and partial copy losses involving PTEN and STK11 showed evidence for having functional relevance. A substantial fraction of cancers showed high mTOR pathway activity without an associated canonical genetic or genomic alteration, including cancers harboring IDH1 or VHL mutations, suggesting multiple mechanisms for pathway activation.

N2  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. We sequenced nine exomes and transcriptomes, and two genomes of GISTs for integrated analyses. We detected 306 somatic variants in nine GISTs and recurrent protein-altering mutations in 29 genes. Transcriptome sequencing revealed 328 gene fusions, and the most frequently involved fusion events were associated with IGF2 fused to several partner genes including CCND1, FUS, and LASP1. We additionally identified three recurrent read-through fusion transcripts: POLA2-CDC42EP2, C8orf42-FBXO25, and STX16-NPEPL1. Notably, we found intragenic deletions in one of three exons of the VHL gene and increased mRNAs of VEGF, PDGF-beta, and IGF-1/2 in 56% of GISTs, suggesting a mechanistic link between VHL inactivation and overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor target genes in the absence of hypoxia. We also identified copy number gain and increased mRNA expression of AMACR, CRIM1, SKP2, and CACNA1E. Mapping of copy number and gene expression results to the KEGG pathways revealed activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in small intestinal GISTs and the MAPK pathway in wild-type GISTs. These observations will allow us to determine the genetic basis of GISTs and will facilitate further investigation to develop new therapeutic options.

N2  - Hemochorial placentation is orchestrated through highly regulated temporal and spatial decisions governing the fate of trophoblast stem/progenitor cells. Trophoblast cell acquisition of specializations facilitating invasion and uterine spiral artery remodeling is a labile process, sensitive to the environment, and represents a process that is vulnerable to dysmorphogenesis in pathologic states. Hypoxia is a signal guiding placental development, and molecular mechanisms directing cellular adaptations to low oxygen tension are integral to trophoblast cell differentiation and placentation. Hypoxia can also be used as an experimental tool to investigate regulatory processes controlling hemochorial placentation. These developmental processes are conserved in mouse, rat, and human placentation. Consequently, elements of these developmental events can be modeled and hypotheses tested in trophoblast stem cells and in genetically manipulated rodents. Hypoxia is also a consequence of a failed placenta, yielding pathologies that can adversely affect maternal adjustments to pregnancy, fetal health, and susceptibility to adult disease. The capacity of the placenta for adaptation to environmental challenges highlights the importance of its plasticity in safeguarding a healthy pregnancy.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a familial cancer syndrome characterized by benign or malignant tumors which may involve more than one system. Retinal hemangioblastomas are usually the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. A 32-yearold man presented to our clinic with vision loss in the left eye for 2 months. He had a history of cerebral hemangioblastoma operation. Family history showed that his mother had unilateral vision loss and died because of renal cell carcinoma. Ophthalmologic examination revealed multiple retinal hemangioblastomas in both eyes. VHL gene sequencing was performed and heterozygous p.R161X mutation was detected. His sister and daughter were also found to have the same variant. A treatment and follow-up plan was initiated for the patient and affected family members. Considering VHL disease in the differential diagnosis of retinal hemangioblastomas has a very important role in the early detection of life-threatening tumors in these patients.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare oncological disease with an incidence of 1:36,000, and is characterized by the growth of different types of tumours. Haemangioblastomas in the central nervous system (CNS) and retina, renal carcinoma and pheochromocytomas are the most common tumours. The absence of treatment for VHL leads to the need of repeated surgeries as the only option for these patients. Targeting VHL-derived tumours with drugs with reduced side effects is urgent to avoid repeated CNS surgeries. Recent reports have demonstrated that propranolol, a β-blocker used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiac and neurological diseases, is the best option for infantile hemangioma (IH). Propranolol could be an efficient treatment to control haemangioblastoma growth in VHL disease given its antiangiogenic effects that were recently demonstrated by us. The main objective of the present study was the assessment of the efficacy and safety of propranolol on retinal haemangioblastoma in von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL).

N2  - E3 ubiquitin ligases are key enzymes within the ubiquitin proteasome system which catalyze the ubiquitination of proteins, targeting them for proteasomal degradation. E3 ligases are gaining importance as targets to small molecules, both for direct inhibition and to be hijacked to induce the degradation of non-native neo-substrates using bivalent compounds known as PROTACs (for 'proteolysis-targeting chimeras'). We describe Homo-PROTACs as an approach to dimerize an E3 ligase to trigger its suicide-type chemical knockdown inside cells. We provide proof-of-concept of Homo-PROTACs using diverse molecules composed of two instances of a ligand for the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase. The most active compound, CM11, dimerizes VHL with high avidity in vitro and induces potent, rapid and proteasome-dependent self-degradation of VHL in different cell lines, in a highly isoform-selective fashion and without triggering a hypoxic response. This approach offers a novel chemical probe for selective VHL knockdown, and demonstrates the potential for a new modality of chemical intervention on E3 ligases.Targeting the ubiquitin proteasome system to modulate protein homeostasis using small molecules has promising therapeutic potential. Here the authors describe Homo-PROTACS: small molecules that can induce the homo-dimerization of E3 ubiquitin ligases and cause their proteasome-dependent degradation.

N2  - Background: BRCA genes are tumor suppressor genes inherited in a dominant fashion. The BRCA-1 mutations has been shown to be associated with many cancers, however no case of BRCA-1 associated multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) has been reported. Case report: We present a case of a 66-year-old female with history of ovarian carcinoma treated by total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. She has a strong family history of breast cancer and is a known carrier of a BRCA-1 mutation. 8 years ago she underwent surgical resection of a single parathyroid adenoma that was causing primary hyperparathyroidism. During routine pelvic imaging follow-up, a 2.5 cm mass was found on her right adrenal gland. Elevated urine and plasma metanephrines were indicative of a pheochromocytoma. Right adrenal resection was done which confirmed this diagnosis. Neck sonography revealed an atrophic thyroid gland, attributed to a remote history of I-131 treatment for Graves' disease. No thyroid masses or nodules were appreciated. Genetic analysis of RET oncogene revealed no abnormalities. Discussion: BRCA-1 is a tumor suppressor gene with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and functions as part of four heteromeric protein complexes that maintain cellular genomic stability, repair damaged DNA, and control cell cycle check points. BRCA-1 mutations are associated with breast and ovarian cancers in females and prostate and breast cancers in males. Other cancers associated with BRCA-1 gene mutations include pancreatic cancer and esophageal cancer. Several cases of pheochromocytoma have been observed in association with BRCA-1 mutation but no cases of MEN have been reported to be associated with BRCA-1. 10- 15% of pheochromocytomas are thought to be related to hereditary causes and up to 50% of cases are due to an underlying susceptibility allele. Genetic syndromes mostly associated with an increased risk for pheochromocytoma include von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), which is associated with mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) .Our patient has the clinical diagnosis of MEN2A, yet there was no family history of this syndrome and there was no RET mutation detected. Conclusion: The BRCA-1 mutation has been shown to be associated with many cancers but insufficient literature is available to confirm the connection between BRCA mutations and endocrine tumors. Hence, further clinical as well as genetic studies need to be done.

N2  - The current advent of molecular technologies together with a multidisciplinary interplay of several fields led to the development of genomics, which concentrates on the detection of pathogenic events at the genome level. The structural and functional genomics approaches have now pinpointed the technical challenge in the exploration of disease-related genes and the recognition of their structural alterations or elucidation of gene function. Various promising technologies and diagnostic applications of structural genomics are currently preparing a large database of disease-genes, genetic alterations etc., by mutation scanning and DNA chip technology. Further the functional genomics also exploring the expression genetics (hybridization-, PCR- and sequence-based technologies), two-hybrid technology, next generation sequencing with Bioinformatics and computational biology. Advances in microarray "chip" technology as microarrays have allowed the parallel analysis of gene expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. Sequence information collected from the genomes of many individuals is leading to the rapid discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. Further advances of genetic engineering have also revolutionized immunoassay biotechnology via engineering of antibody-encoding genes and the phage display technology. The Biotechnology plays an important role in the development of diagnostic assays in response to an outbreak or critical disease response need. However, there is also need to pinpoint various obstacles and issues related to the commercialization and widespread dispersal of genetic knowledge derived from the exploitation of the biotechnology industry and the development and marketing of diagnostic services. Implementation of genetic criteria for patient selection and individual assessment of the risks and benefits of treatment emerges as a major challenge to the pharmaceutical industry. Thus this field is revolutionizing current era and further it may open new vistas in the field of disease management. Copyright © 2017, Association of Clinical Biochemists of India.

N2  - Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) 2 is a transcriptional factor related to adaptive responses against cellular stress from a xenobiotic substance. Recent evidence indicates ARNT is involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression; however, little is known about the relevance of ARNT2 in the behavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the current study, we evaluated the ARNT2 mRNA and protein expression levels in OSCC in vitro and in vivo and the clinical relationship between ARNT2 expression levels in primary OSCCs and their clinicopathologic status by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Using ARNT2 overexpression models, we performed functional analyses to investigate the critical roles of ARNT2 in OSCC. ARNT2 mRNA and protein were down-regulated significantly (P < 0.05 for both comparisons) in nine OSCC-derived cells and primary OSCC (n=100 patients) compared with normal counterparts. In addition to the data from exogenous experiments that ARNT2-overexpressed cells showed decreased cellular proliferation, ARNT2-positive OSCC cases were correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with tumoral size. Since von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1)-alpha, is a downstream molecule of ARNT2, we speculated that HIF1-alpha and its downstream molecules would have key functions in cellular growth. Consistent with our hypothesis, overexpressed ARNT2 cells showed down-regulation of HIF1-alpha, which causes hypofunctioning of glucose transporter 1, leading to decreased cellular growth. Our results proposed for the first time that the ARNT2 level is an indicator of cellular proliferation in OSCCs. Therefore, ARNT2 may be a potential therapeutic target against progression of OSCCs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by the development of benign and malignant tumours in many organ systems, including renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. It is not completely understood what underlies the development of renal pathology, and the use of murine Vhl models has been challenging due to limitations in disease conservation. We previously described a zebrafish model bearing inactivating mutations in the orthologue of the human VHL gene.METHODS: We used histopathological and functional assays to investigate the pronephric and glomerular developmental defects in vhl mutant zebrafish, supported by human cell culture assays.RESULTS: Here, we report that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity in zebrafish embryos. vhl mutant glomeruli are enlarged, cxcr4a+ capillary loops are dilated and the Bowman space is widened. While we did not observe pronephric cysts, the cells of the proximal convoluted and anterior proximal straight tubule are enlarged, periodic acid schiff (PAS) and Oil Red O positive, and display a clear cytoplasm after hematoxylin and eosine staining. Ultrastructural analysis showed the vhl-/- tubule to accumulate large numbers of vesicles of variable size and electron density. Microinjection of the endocytic fluorescent marker AM1-43 in zebrafish embryos revealed an accumulation of endocytic vesicles in the vhl mutant pronephric tubule, which we can recapitulate in human cells lacking VHL.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity during zebrafish development, and suggests a role for VHL in endocytic vesicle trafficking.

N2  - Oxygen-dependent regulation of the erythropoietin gene is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family of transcription factors. When oxygen is plentiful, HIF undergoes hydroxylation by a family of oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins, promoting its association with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin E3 ligase and subsequent proteosomal degradation. When oxygen is scarce, the PHD enzymes are inactivated, leading to HIF accumulation and upregulation not only of erythropoietin expression, but also the expression of hundreds of other genes, including those coordinating cardiovascular and ventilatory adaptation to hypoxia. Nevertheless, despite the identification of over 50 mutations in the PHD-HIF-VHL pathway in patients with previously unexplained congenital erythrocytosis, there are very few reports of associated cardiopulmonary abnormalities. We now report exaggerated pulmonary vascular and ventilatory responses to acute hypoxia in a 35-year-old man with erythrocytosis secondary to heterozygous mutation in PHD2, the most abundant of the PHD isoforms. We compare this phenotype with that reported in patients with the archetypal disorder of cellular oxygen sensing, Chuvash polycythemia, and discuss the possible clinical implications of our findings, particularly in the light of the emerging role for small molecule PHD inhibitors in clinical practice.

N2  - Targeted proteolysis of endogenous proteins is desirable as a research toolkit and in therapeutics. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockouts are irreversible and often not feasible for many genes. Similarly, RNA interference approaches necessitate prolonged treatments, can lead to incomplete knockdowns and are often associated with off-target effects. Targeted proteolysis can overcome these limitations. In this report, we describe an affinity-directed protein missile (AdPROM) system that harbours the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, the substrate receptor of the Cullin2 (CUL2) E3 ligase complex, tethered to polypeptide binders that selectively bind and recruit endogenous target proteins to the CUL2-E3 ligase complex for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. By using synthetic monobodies that selectively bind the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and a camelid-derived VHH nanobody that selectively binds the human ASC protein, we demonstrate highly efficient AdPROM-mediated degradation of endogenous SHP2 and ASC in human cell lines. We show that AdPROM-mediated loss of SHP2 in cells impacts SHP2 biology. This study demonstrates for the first time that small polypeptide binders that selectively recognize endogenous target proteins can be exploited for AdPROM-mediated destruction of the target proteins.

N2  - The activation/inactivation of HIF1alpha is precisely regulated in an oxygen-dependent manner. HIF1alpha is essential for hypoxia induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Several recent studies indicated that the expression of miRNAs can be modulated by hypoxia. However, the involvement of miRNAs in the regulation of HIF1alpha induction remains elusive. In present study, we demonstrated that miR-101 was rapidly and transiently induced after hypoxia in breast cancer cells. Over-expression of miR-101 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in breast cancer cells through increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in normoxia condition. This inhibitory phenomenon seems due to miR-101-mediated induction of HIF1alpha, because we identified that VHL, a negative regulator of HIF1alpha, is a novel target of miR-101 and over-expression of miR-101 decreased VHL levels and subsequently stabilized HIF1alpha and induced its downstream target VEGFA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of VHL or HIF1alpha overexpression could also induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest whereas enforced expression of VHL, administration of anti-miR-101 oligos or treatment of 2-MeOE2, an inhibitor of HIF1alpha, could rescue cells from such inhibition. These results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of HIF1alpha induction in normoxia and suggest that miR-101 mediated proliferation inhibition may through HIF1alpha mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

N2  - The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein is the substrate binding subunit of the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets hydroxylated alpha subunit of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. VHL is a potential target for treating anemia and ischemic diseases, motivating the development of inhibitors of the VHL:HIF-alpha protein-protein interaction. Additionally, bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) containing a VHL ligand can hijack the E3 ligase activity to induce degradation of target proteins. We report the structure-guided design and group-based optimization of a series of VHL inhibitors with low nanomolar potencies and improved cellular permeability. Structure-activity relationships led to the discovery of potent inhibitors 10 and chemical probe VH298, with dissociation constants <100 nM, which induced marked HIF-1alpha intracellular stabilization. Our study provides new chemical tools to probe the VHL-HIF pathways and new VHL ligands for next-generation PROTACs.

N2  - Erythrocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by increased red cell mass and elevated hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. Several genetic variants have been identified as causes for erythrocytosis in genes belonging to different pathways including oxygen sensing, erythropoiesis and oxygen transport. However, despite clinical investigation and screening for these mutations, the cause of disease cannot be found in a considerable number of patients, who are classified as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. In this study, we developed a targeted next-generation sequencing panel encompassing the exonic regions of 21 genes from relevant pathways (~79 Kb) and sequenced 125 patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis. The panel effectively screened 97% of coding regions of these genes, with an average coverage of 450X. It identified 51 different rare variants, all leading to alterations of protein sequence, with 57 out of 125 cases (45.6%) having at least one of these variants. Ten of these were known erythrocytosis-causing variants, which had been missed following existing diagnostic algorithms. Twenty-two were novel variants in erythrocytosis-associated genes (EGLN1, EPAS1, VHL, BPGM, JAK2, SH2B3) and in novel genes included in the panel (e.g. EPO, EGLN2, HIF3A, OS9), some with a high likelihood of functionality, for which future segregation, functional and replication studies will be useful to provide further evidence for causality. The rest were classified as polymorphisms. Overall, these results demonstrate the benefits of using a gene panel rather than existing methods in which focused genetic screening is performed depending on biochemical measurements: the gene panel improves diagnostic accuracy and provides the opportunity for discovery of novel variants.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Many malignant tumors initially appear benign but subsequently exhibit extensive metastases. Early identification of malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) before metastasis is important for improved prognosis. However, there are no robust prognostic indices of recurrence and malignancy. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical and histopathological factors that predict malignant PPGLs.DESIGN: Retrospective follow-up study.METHODS: In this study, we included 223 patients with pathologically confirmed PPGLs who were treated between 2000 and 2015 at the Seoul National University Hospital in South Korea.RESULTS: Of these patients, 29 were diagnosed with malignancy, 12 of whom presented with metastatic lesions at the initial diagnosis while 17 developed metastases during follow-up. Nineteen patients with recurrent PPGLs consisted of ones with malignant PPGLs (n = 17) and multifocal PPGLs (n = 2) who had VHL and RET mutations. The mean age at presentation for malignant PPGLs was significantly younger than that for benign PPGLs (43.0 vs. 49.0 years, respectively; p = 0.023). Tumor size was not a distinguishing factor between malignant and benign PPGLs (5.0 vs. 4.5 cm, respectively; p = 0.316) nor did it predict recurrence. Of 119 patients with available pheochromocytoma of adrenal gland scaled score (PASS) data, those with malignant PPGLs presented PASS values >=4. Of 12 parameters of PASS, necrosis, capsular invasion, vascular invasion, cellular monotony, high mitosis, atypical mitotic figures, and nuclear hyperchromasia were significant predictors of malignancy.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor size did not predict malignancy or recurrence of PPGLs. PPGL patients with characteristic pathologic findings and PASS >=4 or germline mutations require close follow-up.

N2  - The hypoxic microenvironment is an important contributor of glioblastoma (GBM) aggressiveness via HIF1alpha, while tumour inflammation is profoundly influenced by FAT Atypical Cadherin (FAT1). This study was designed to explore the functional interaction and significance of FAT1 and HIF1alpha under severe hypoxia-mimicking tumour microenvironment in primary human tumours. We first identified a positive correlation of FAT1 with HIF1alpha and its target genes in GBM tumour specimens, revealing the significance of the FAT1-HIF1alpha axis in glioma cells. We found that severe hypoxia leads to an increased expression of FAT1 and HIF1alpha in U87MG and U373MG cells. To reveal the relevance of FAT1 under hypoxic conditions, we depleted endogenous FAT1 under hypoxia and found a substantial reduction in the expression of HIF1alpha and its downstream target genes like CA9, GLUT1, VEGFA, MCT4, HK2, BNIP3 and REDD1, as well as a significant reduction in the invasiveness in GBM cells. At the molecular level, under hypoxia the FAT1 depletion-associated reduction in HIF1alpha was due to compromised EGFR-Akt signaling as well as increased VHL-dependent proteasomal degradation of HIF1alpha. In brief, for the first time, these results reveal an upstream master regulatory role of FAT1 in the expression and role of HIF1alpha under hypoxic conditions and that FAT1-HIF1alpha axis controls the invasiveness of GBM. Hence, FAT1 represents a novel potential therapeutic target for GBM.

N2  - Mutations in VHL underlie von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, a hereditary cancer syndrome with several subtypes depending on the risk of developing certain combination of classic features, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), hemangioblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Although numerous potential substrates and functions of pVHL have been described over the past decade, the best-defined role of pVHL has remained as the negative regulator of the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor via the oxygen-dependent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha subunit. Despite the seminal discoveries that led to the molecular elucidation of the mammalian oxygen-sensing VHL-HIF axis, which have provided several rational therapies, the mechanisms underlying the complex genotype-phenotype correlation in VHL disease are unclear. This review will discuss and highlight the studies that have provided interesting insights as well as uncertainties to the underlying mechanisms governing VHL disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalec tomy has several advantages compared with the transperitoneal approach such as a shorter and more direct route to the target organ, no breach of the intraperitoneal space, and no required retraction of the adjacent organs. It also is a safe procedure with a short learning curve.1<sup>-</sup>5 This report presents a challenging case of an extra-adrenal paraganglioma located in the aorto-caval space and managed using the retroperitoneal approach.METHODS: A 39-year-old man was placed in the prone jackknife position, and three incisions were made in the right posterior abdominal wall for placement of the laparoscopic ports. The retroperitoneal space was entered with diathermy and blunt finger dissection, and retropneumoperitoneum was achieved with carbon dioxide insufflation pressure up to 18 mmHg. After identification of the right kidney and vessels, the tumor was meticulously dissected and excised with an energy device. The specimen was removed using a laparoscopic specimen retrieval bag, and the port sites were closed in layers.RESULTS: The operative time was 130 min, and the total blood loss was 30 ml. The tumor was diagnosed as a moderately differentiated extra-adrenal paraganglioma. The Von Hippel-Lindau gene mutation was detected using next-generation sequencing.CONCLUSIONS: The posterior retroperitoneoscopic approach is a safe, feasible, and effective method for excising an extra-adrenal paraganglioma even in the aorto-caval space. The authors suggest that this procedure is a useful surgical option for treatment of an aorto-caval paraganglioma for selected patients and by experienced surgeons.

N2  - The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1; also known as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2] is an important mediator of monocyte recruitment during inflammatory processes. Pathologically high expression levels of MCP-1 by tumor cells have been observed in a variety of cancer types. In the majority of cases, high MCP-1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis, as infiltration of the tumor with inflammatory monocytes promotes tumor progression and metastasis. MCP-1 is also expressed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the present study, the function and the regulation of MCP-1 was investigated in two RCC cell lines, CaKi-1 and 786-O. In both cell lines, expression of MCP-1 was significantly enhanced compared with non-cancerous control cells. As expected, secretion of MCP-1 into the medium facilitated the recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes via the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor type 2 (CCR2). As expression of CCR2 was also detected in 786-O and CaKi-1 cells, the effect of autocrine MCP-1/CCR2 signaling was evaluated in these cells. In proliferation assays, administration of an MCP-1 neutralizing antibody or of a CCR2 antagonist to CaKi-1 and 786-O cells significantly decreased cell growth; supplementation of the growth medium with recombinant human MCP-1 had no additional effect on proliferation. The migration ability of RCC cells was impaired by MCP-1 neutralization or pharmacological CCR2 inhibition, while it was stimulated by the addition of recombinant human MCP-1, compared with untreated control cells. Finally, substantial differences in the regulation of MCP-1 expression were observed between RCC cell lines. In CaKi-1 cells, expression of MCP-1 appears to be largely mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5, while in 786-O cells, deletion of the tumor suppressor gene Von-Hippel-Lindau appeared to be responsible for MCP-1 upregulation, as suggested by previous studies. Taken together, the results of the current study indicate that expression of MCP-1 in RCC cells promotes tumor progression and metastasis not only by paracrine, but also by autocrine, MCP-1/CCR2 signaling events, enhancing cell proliferation and migration ability. Therefore, the present findings suggest the MCP-1/CCR2 axis is a potential target for future therapeutic strategies in the treatment of metastatic RCC.

N2  - The prevalence of RCC in Europe is 2-3% and increasing every year. Hereditary predisposition is found in 5-8% of all RCC cases. Hereditary syndromes associated with RCC include: Von Hippel-Lindau, hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma, Birt-Hogg-Dube', hereditary leiomyomatosis, succinate dehydrogenase's deficiency, tuberous sclerosis complex and Cowden's syndrome. These syndromes are related to specific genetic mutations. So far the European Association of Urology and American Urological Association have not established guidelines for referral of patients with RCC for germline mutation screening. The scope of this article is to review which clinical manifestations should direct clinicians' thinking towards hereditary kidney carcinomas and therefore suggest which patients could benefit from genetic testing.

N2  - Epigenetic alterations in the methylome have been associated with tumor development and progression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In this study, 45 tumor samples, 12 tumor-free kidney cortex tissues, and 24 peripheral blood samples from patients with clear cell RCC (ccRCC) were analyzed by genome-wide promoter-directed methylation arrays and related to clinicopathological parameters. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated the tumors into two distinct methylation groups (clusters A and B), where cluster B had higher average methylation and increased number of hypermethylated CpG sites (CpGs). Furthermore, tumors in cluster B had, compared with cluster A, a larger tumor diameter (p = 0.033), a higher morphologic grade (p < 0.001), a higher tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (p < 0.001), and a worse prognosis (p = 0.005). Higher TNM stage was correlated to an increase in average methylation level (p = 0.003) and number of hypermethylated CpGs (p = 0.003), whereas a number of hypomethylated CpGs were mainly unchanged. However, the predicted age of the tumors based on methylation profile did not correlate with TNM stage, morphological grade, or methylation cluster. Differently methylated (DM) genes (n = 840) in ccRCC samples compared with tumor-free kidney cortex samples were predominantly hypermethylated and a high proportion were identified as polycomb target genes. The DM genes were overrepresented by transcription factors, ligands, and receptors, indicating functional alterations of significance for ccRCC progression. To conclude, increased number of hypermethylated genes was associated with increased TNM stage of the tumors. DNA methylation classification of ccRCC tumor samples at diagnosis can serve as a clinically applicable prognostic marker in ccRCC.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) has been reported as a tumor-suppressor gene in some cancers. However, the association between VHL promoter hypermethylation and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains to be clarified. We are the first to systematically integrate published papers to assess the role of hypermethylated VHL in RCC.METHODS: The potential relevant papers were searched via PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. The overall odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate the relationship between VHL promoter hypermethylation and RCC.RESULTS: Finally, a total of 1,998 RCC patients and 294 controls from 13 eligible articles were included in this meta-analysis. Under the fixed-effects model, the pooled OR from seven studies including 596 RCC and 294 nonmalignant samples showed that VHL promoter hypermethylation was significantly higher in cancer than in controls (OR = 7.93, 95% CI = 2.84- 22.15, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis based on ethnic population and testing method revealed that hypermethylated VHL had a significantly similar OR value in different races and detection methodologies. No significant association was found between hypermethylated VHL and tumor grade, tumor stage, tumor size, histological types, and lymph node status in cancer (all P > 0.05). In the current study, there was no evidence of publication bias as determined by Egger's test (all P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: In the investigated patients, VHL promoter hypermethylation, which may play an important role in carcinogenesis of RCC, is significantly associated with an increased risk of RCC. However, VHL promoter hypermethylation is not correlated with specific clinicopathological characteristics. Additional future studies are needed to confirm our results.

N2  - The etiology of most childhood cancer remains largely unknown, but is likely attributable to random or induced genetic aberrations in somatic tissue. However, a subset of children develops cancer in the setting of an underlying inheritable condition involving a germline genetic mutation or chromosomal aberration. The term "neurocutaneous syndrome" encompasses a group of multisystem, hereditary disorders that are associated with skin manifestations as well as central and/or peripheral nervous system lesions of variable severity. This review outlines the central nervous system tumors associated with underlying neurocutaneous disorders, including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, Von Hippel Lindau, and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Recognizing the presence of an underlying syndrome is critically important to both optimizing clinical care and treatment as well as genetic counseling and monitoring of these affected patients and their families.

N2  - We previously developed (2-deoxyglucose)-(ABT-263) combination therapy (2DG-ABT), which induces apoptosis by activating Bak in the mitochondria of highly glycolytic cells with varied genetic backgrounds. However, the rates of apoptosis induced by 2DG-ABT were lower in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-deficient cancer cells. The re-expression of VHL protein in these cells lowered IGF1R expression in a manner independent of oxygen concentration. Lowering IGF1R expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitized the cells to 2DG-ABT, suggesting that IGF1R interfered with the activation of apoptosis by the mitochondria. To determine which of the two pathways activated by IGF1R, the Ras-ERK pathway or the PI3K-AKT pathway, was involved in the impairment of mitochondria activation, the cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of either PI3K or ERK, and 2DG-ABT was added to activate the mitochondria. The apoptotic rates resulting from 2DG-ABT treatment were higher in the cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor, while the rates remained approximately the same in the cells treated with the ERK inhibitor. In 2DG-ABT-sensitive cells, a 4-h 2DG treatment caused the dissociation of Mcl-1 from Bak, while ABT treatment alone caused the dissociation of Bcl-xL from Bak without substantially reducing Mcl-1 levels. In 2DG-ABT-resistant cells, Mcl-1 dissociated from Bak only when AKT activity was inhibited during the 4-h 2DG treatment. Thus, in VHL-deficient cells, IGF1R activated AKT and stabilized the Bak-Mcl-1 complex, thereby conferring cell resistance to apoptosis.

N2  - There are a significant number of diseases and treatment considerations of considerable importance relating to the skin and renal systems. This emphasizes the need for dermatologists in practice or in clinical training to be aware of these associations. Part I of this 2-part continuing medical education article reviews the genetic syndromes with both renal and cutaneous involvement that are most important for the dermatologist to be able to identify, manage, and appropriately refer to nephrology colleagues. Part II reviews the inflammatory syndromes with relevant renal manifestations and therapeutic agents commonly used by dermatologists that have drug-induced effects on or require close consideration of renal function. In addition, we will likewise review therapeutic agents commonly used by nephrologists that have drug-induced effects on the skin that dermatologists are likely to encounter in clinical practice. In both parts of this continuing medical education article, we discuss diagnosis, management, and appropriate referral to our nephrology colleagues in the context of each nephrocutaneous association. There are a significant number of dermatoses associated with renal abnormalities and disease, emphasizing the need for dermatologists to be keenly aware of their presence in order to avoid overlooking important skin conditions with potentially devastating renal complications. This review discusses important nephrocutaneous disease associations with recommendations for the appropriate urgency of referral to nephrology colleagues for diagnosis, surveillance, and early management of potential renal sequelae.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare familial cancer predisposition syndrome caused by a loss or mutation in a single gene,VHL, but it exhibits a wide phenotypic variability that can be categorized into distinct subtypes. The phenotypic variability has been largely argued to be attributable to the extent of deregulation of the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha, a well established target of VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase, ECV (Elongins/Cul2/VHL). Here, we show that erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) is hydroxylated on proline 419 and 426 via prolyl hydroxylase 3. EPOR hydroxylation is required for binding to the beta domain of VHL and polyubiquitylation via ECV, leading to increased EPOR turnover. In addition, several type-specific VHL disease-causing mutants, including those that have retained proper binding and regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha, showed a severe defect in binding prolyl hydroxylated EPOR peptides. These results identify EPOR as the secondbona fidehydroxylation-dependent substrate of VHL that potentially influences oxygen homeostasis and contributes to the complex genotype-phenotype correlation in VHL disease.

N2  - Several genetic tumor syndromes have associated central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms. The spectrum of syndromes that have intracranial tumor manifestations includes ataxia telangiectasia, Cowden syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis-related colorectal cancer, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and Turcot syndrome. Many of these disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and identification of the associated genetic defects has led to improved understanding of the molecular pathways involved in tumorigenesis, helping pave the way to the emergence of molecularly targeted therapeutics. Recognition of individuals and families at risk for such tumors is critical to improve clinical care and optimize proper genetic counseling. To contribute effectively, the radiologist should recognize the common varieties of tumors and characteristic neuroimaging manifestations seen in each familial syndrome. A fundamental understanding of the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of these tumors is critical in understanding the development of specific and unique tumors in each entity. In this article, we review the most common genetic tumor syndromes with associated intracranial neoplasms, with emphasis on recent genetic and molecular biology data, clinical manifestations, and management as well as the controversies and current recommendations for screening and surveillance. A detailed overview of all the major and pertinent CNS imaging features will be elucidated, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and, in relevant cases, magnetic resonance spectroscopy. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2016.

N2  - (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by hemangioblastomas of retina and central nervous system (CNS); renal cysts, clear cell carcinoma; PCC; endolymphatic sac tumors; cystadenomas of the epididymis in males, broad ligament of uterus in females; pancreatic cysts, cystadenomas and neuroendocrine tumors. We here report two cases of VHL disease presented with PCC as the first manifestation. Hemangioblastoma of CNS in the first case and PNET in the second case developed during follow- up and led to the diagnosis of VHL disease. Genetic analyses of cases revealed p.Arg161Gln (c.482G>A) and p.Leu129Pro(c.386T>G) heterozygous missense mutation in VHL gene, respectively. In children, PCC may be the only and/or initial manifestation of the disease with delayed manifestations of the syndrome in other organs. PNET is a very rare manifestation of VHL disease. To best of our knowledge, this is the second case in literature, presenting with combination of PNET and bilateral PCC as components of childhood VHL disease. Pediatric patients diagnosed with PCC should be investigated for the genetic causes especially for VHL.

N2  - Background: Although inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL), located on chromosome 3p25, is considered to be a major cause of hemangioblastomas (HBs), the incidence of biallelic inactivation of VHL is reportedly low. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of VHL alterations in HBs, as well as to identify additional molecular aberrations.Methods: Genetic and epigenetic alterations were comprehensively and comparatively analyzed in 11 VHL-related and 21 sporadic HBs.Results: VHL alterations detected by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis were more frequent in VHL-related HBs than in sporadic HBs (100% vs 62%; P = 0.029). VHL alterations were found only in 4 sporadic HBs by direct sequencing; however, targeted deep sequencing detected 9 additional alterations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 3 was found in 64% and 57% of VHL-related and sporadic HBs, respectively, by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Among 19 tumors with chromosome 3 LOH, 5 were classified as copy-neutral LOH. VHL promoter hypermethylation was detected only in sporadic HBs (33%), indicating that epigenetic suppression of VHL is a common mechanism in sporadic HBs. The rate of biallelic VHL inactivation among VHL-related and sporadic HBs was 64% and 52%, respectively. LOH on either chromosome 6 or 10 was detected only in sporadic HBs (43%).Conclusion: Although biallelic inactivation of VHL is a dominant mechanistic cause of the pathogenesis of HB, other unknown mechanisms may also be involved, and such mechanisms may be different between VHL-related and sporadic HB.

N2  - BACKGROUND: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-related tumors occurring outside the spectrum of VHL-defining tumors are rare, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) in the setting of VHL disease has not been described.METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe a patient with confirmed VHL mutation who presented with a parotid mass and a history of 2 central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas and 1 pheochromocytoma. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass suggested a benign Warthin tumor. The mass was resected and final pathology revealed a low-grade MEC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the MECT1/MAML2 fusion gene frequently associated with MEC was performed and was negative. Molecular testing of tumor cells displayed a likely "second hit" VHL gene mutation.CONCLUSION: There is a possible broader role of VHL mutations in tumorigenesis beyond the development of classically described VHL-defining neoplasms. Our case also demonstrates the importance of always considering the possibility of a parotid malignancy in patients with VHL despite a benign FNA. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Accelerated glycolysis, a common process in tumor cells called the Warburg effect, is associated with various biological phenomena. However, the role of glycolysis induced by arsenite, a well-established human carcinogen, is unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as regulators in various cancers, but how lncRNAs regulate glucose metabolism remains largely unexplored. We have found that, in human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells, arsenite increases lactate production; glucose consumption; and expression of glycolysis-related genes, including HK-2, Eno-1, and Glut-4. In L-02 cells exposed to arsenite, the lncRNA, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)-alpha, the transcriptional regulators of cellular response to hypoxia, are over-expressed. In addition, HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha, is involved in arsenite-induced glycolysis, and MALAT1 enhances arsenite-induced glycolysis. Although MALAT1 regulates HIF-alpha and promotes arsenite-induced glycolysis, MALAT1 promotes glycolysis through HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha. Moreover, arsenite-increased MALAT1 enhances the disassociation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor from HIF-1alpha, alleviating VHL-mediated ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha, which causes accumulation of HIF-1alpha. In sum, these findings indicate that MALAT1, acting through HIF-1alpha stabilization, is a mediator that enhances glycolysis induced by arsenite. These results provide a link between the induction of lncRNAs and the glycolysis in cells exposed to arsenite, and thus establish a previously unknown mechanism for arsenite-induced hepatotoxicity.

N2  - Protein-coding mutations in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have been extensively characterized, frequently involving inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. Roles for noncoding cis-regulatory aberrations in ccRCC tumorigenesis, however, remain unclear. Analyzing 10 primary tumor/normal pairs and 9 cell lines across 79 chromatin profiles, we observed pervasive enhancer malfunction in ccRCC, with cognate enhancer-target genes associated with tissue-specific aspects of malignancy. Superenhancer profiling identified ZNF395 as a ccRCC-specific and VHL-regulated master regulator whose depletion causes near-complete tumor elimination in vitro and in vivoVHL loss predominantly drives enhancer/superenhancer deregulation more so than promoters, with acquisition of active enhancer marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1) near ccRCC hallmark genes. Mechanistically, VHL loss stabilizes HIF2alpha-HIF1beta heterodimer binding at enhancers, subsequently recruiting histone acetyltransferase p300 without overtly affecting preexisting promoter-enhancer interactions. Subtype-specific driver mutations such as VHL may thus propagate unique pathogenic dependencies in ccRCC by modulating epigenomic landscapes and cancer gene expression.<b>Significance:</b> Comprehensive epigenomic profiling of ccRCC establishes a compendium of somatically altered cis-regulatory elements, uncovering new potential targets including ZNF395, a ccRCC master regulator. Loss of VHL, a ccRCC signature event, causes pervasive enhancer malfunction, with binding of enhancer-centric HIF2alpha and recruitment of histone acetyltransferase p300 at preexisting lineage-specific promoter-enhancer complexes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The genomic features underpinning renal cell carcinoma with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation (sRCC) are not well understood, and at present, there are no specific or effective therapies for sRCC.OBJECTIVE: To identify genomic alterations in patients with sRCC.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted genomic profiling on paired epithelial and sarcomatoid areas of three sRCC cases. Genomic profiling was performed on another 23 sRCC patients harboring diverse epithelial components (total of 26 cases). Genomic profiling was conducted using a hybrid capture DNA next-generation sequencing assay of 236 cancer-related genes plus 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results were compared with 56 similarly sequenced cases of clear cell RCC (ccRCC) devoid of a sarcomatoid component, and with clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Four additional ccRCC cases underwent whole exome sequencing.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Genomic alterations in patients with sRCC and ccRCC were described, and their frequencies were compared using the Fisher exact test.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Two of three patients with sRCC who underwent genomic profiling of both their epithelial and sarcomatoid components demonstrated identical mutational profiles, and a third case demonstrated commonly disrupted genes. Of the 26 sRCCs, TP53 (42.3%), VHL (34.6%), CDKN2A (26.9%), and NF2 (19.2%) were the most frequently altered genes. NF2 mutations were mutually exclusive with TP53 but not with VHL mutations. Limitations include the small sample size.CONCLUSIONS: We found that sRCC contains different driver mutations than ccRCC. The epithelial and sarcomatoid components of sRCC largely contain the same genomic features. On the basis of harboring either TP53 or NF2 mutations, sRCC can be divided into two groups. These findings may have implications for understanding the oncogenesis of sarcomatoid renal tumors and for defining systemic treatment options.PATIENT SUMMARY: Next-generation sequencing of tumors from patients with sarcomatoid kidney cancer reveals mutations that differ from those in nonsarcomatoid patients. These findings have implications in understanding the pathobiology of sarcomatoid kidney cancer and indicate the need for a different treatment approach in these patients.

N2  - Purpose: Many patients with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors experience a rapid response, but ultimately develop resistance. Insight into the mechanism of resistance is critical for development of more effective treatment strategies. Experimental Design: Comprehensive genomic profiling of serial biopsies was performed in a patient with a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant metastatic melanoma who developed resistance to vemurafenib. An AGAP3-BRAF fusion gene, identified in the vemurafenib-resistant tumor, was expressed in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanoma cell lines, and its effect on drug sensitivity was evaluated. Results: Clinical resistance to vemurafenib in a melanoma harboring a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation was associated with acquisition of an AGAP3-BRAF fusion gene. Expression of the AGAP3-BRAF fusion in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma cells induced vemurafenib resistance; however, these cells remained relatively sensitive to MEK inhibitors. The patient experienced clinical benefit following treatment with the combination of a BRAF and a MEK inhibitor. Rebiopsy of the tumor at a later time point, after BRAF and MEK inhibitors had been discontinued, showed loss of the AGAP3-BRAF fusion gene. Mixing experiments suggest that cells harboring both BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and AGAP3-BRAF only have a fitness advantage over parental BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> cells during active treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. Conclusions: We report acquisition of a BRAF fusion as a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to vemurafenib in a patient with melanoma harboring a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation. The acquisition and regression of clones harboring this fusion during the presence and absence of a BRAF inhibitor are consistent with rapidly evolving clonal dynamics in melanoma.

N2  - Sirtuin family proteins are involved in the regulation of hypoxic responses which are primarily dependent on a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). However, few studies have examined the use of sirtuin inhibitors to regulate HIF. The present study examined the effect of a SIRT2-specific inhibitor, AK-1, on hypoxic responses. Under hypoxic conditions, AK-1 increased the ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha in a VHL-dependent manner, leading to the degradation of HIF-1alpha via a proteasomal pathway. Downregulation of HIF-1alpha expression reduced its transcriptional activity and, eventually, reduced the expression of BNIP3, one of HIF-1 target genes, in AK-1-treated cells. These data demonstrate that SIRT2 inhibition attenuates hypoxic responses, and that SIRT2 inhibitors may have potential as treatments for hypoxia-associated pathological conditions.

N2  - Peptide modulators targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) exhibit greater potential than small-molecule drugs in several important aspects including facile modification and relative large contact surface area. Stabilized peptides constructed by variable chemistry methods exhibit improved peptide stability and cell permeability compared to that of the linears. Herein, we designed a stabilized peptide-based proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) targeting estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) by tethering an N-terminal aspartic acid cross-linked stabilized peptide ERalpha modulator (TD-PERM) with a pentapeptide that binds the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The resulting heterobifunctional peptide (TD-PROTAC) selectively recruits ERalpha to the VHL E3 ligase complex, leading to the degradation of ERalpha in a proteasome-dependent manner. Compared with the control peptides, TD-PROTAC shows significantly enhanced activities in reducing the transcription of the ERalpha-downstream genes and inhibiting the proliferation of ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells. In addition, in vivo experiments indicate that TD-PROTAC leads to tumor regression in the MCF-7 mouse xenograft model. This work is a successful attempt to construct PROTACs based on cell-permeable stabilized peptides, which significantly broadens the chemical space of PROTACs and stabilized peptides.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau-binding protein 1 (VBP1) physically interacts with pVHL, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, which degrades HIF-1alpha in an oxygen-dependent manner. HIF-1 is a key regulator of adaptive responses to a lack of oxygen that controls glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. However, the role of VBP1 in pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-1alpha is not yet known. In this study, we show that VBP1 enhances the stability of pVHL and facilitates pVHL-mediated ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha. Furthermore, VBP1 suppresses HIF-1alpha-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo. These findings suggest that VBP1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor protein associated with HIF-1alpha regulation.

N2  - Kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), is a disease of increasing incidence that is commonly seen in the general practice of nephrology. However, RCC is underrecognized by the nephrology community, such that its presence in curricula and research by this group is lacking. In the most common form of RCC, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor is nearly universal; thus, the biology of ccRCC is characterized by activation of hypoxia-relevant pathways that lead to the associated paraneoplastic syndromes. Therefore, RCC is labeled the internist's tumor. In light of this characterization and multiple other metabolic abnormalities recently associatedwith ccRCC, it can now be viewed as a metabolic disease. In this review, we discuss the basic biology, pathology, and approaches for treatment ofRCC. It is important to distinguishbetween kidney confinement anddistant spread of RCC, because this difference affects diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and patient survival, and it is important to recognize the key interplay between RCC, RCC therapy, and CKD. Better understanding of all aspects of this disease will lead to optimal patient care and more recognition of an increasingly prevalent nephrologic disease, which we now appropriately label the nephrologist's tumor.

N2  - Inducing macromolecular interactions with small molecules to activate cellular signaling is a challenging goal. PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) are bifunctional molecules that recruit a target protein in proximity to an E3 ubiquitin ligase to trigger protein degradation. Structural elucidation of the key ternary ligase-PROTAC-target species and its impact on target degradation selectivity remain elusive. We solved the crystal structure of Brd4 degrader MZ1 in complex with human VHL and the Brd4 bromodomain (Brd4<sup>BD2</sup>). The ligand folds into itself to allow formation of specific intermolecular interactions in the ternary complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies, supported by surface mutagenesis and proximity assays, are consistent with pronounced cooperative formation of ternary complexes with Brd4<sup>BD2</sup>. Structure-based-designed compound AT1 exhibits highly selective depletion of Brd4 in cells. Our results elucidate how PROTAC-induced de novo contacts dictate preferential recruitment of a target protein into a stable and cooperative complex with an E3 ligase for selective degradation.

N2  - The molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remain poorly defined. VEGF, a potent angiogenic factor, is up-regulated in a variety of cancers and contributes to angiogenesis in tumor tissues. The level of VEGF correlates with progression of malignancy. We previously reported that miR-92 is abnormally elevated in the plasma of EOC patients. Here, we tested the hypothesis that miR-92 inhibits von Hippel-Lindau gene product (VHL), a tumor suppressor gene, and in turn de-represses HIF-1alpha, a known key transcription factor for VEGF, to stimulate VEGF expression. Using a variety of biomedical methods including Western blot, RT-PCR, gene silencing, luciferase assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation in both surgically-resected specimens and EOC cell culture, we established that EOC cells have elevated levels of HIF-1alpha and miR-92 expression, but the expression of VHL is reduced. We further demonstrated that miR-92 can target the VHL transcript to repress its expression. We also found that stabilized HIF-1alpha can form an active complex with transcriptional coactivator p300 and phosphorylated-STAT3 at the VEGF promoter to stimulate its expression. In addition, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 are positively regulated by HIF-1alpha. These results suggest that miR-92 can potentially be considered as a novel therapeutical target in treatment of EOS.

N2  - Objective: Pheochromocytoma is catecholamine-producing adrenal tumors arising from neural crest-derived cells and characterized by triads of paroxysmal headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis. Pheochromocytoma may be associated with underlying hereditary conditions, such as von Hippel-Lindau disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A and 2B, neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis. This study investigated clinical presentation and outcome of pheochromocytoma in children and adolescents. Methods: Seven patients (6 males and 1 female) were included. Clinical and radiological features, laboratory findings, perioperative management were reviewed retrospectively. Results: The age at diagnosis was 11.4 +/- 1.4years and follow-up duration was 5.9 +/- 7.5 years (1 months - 17.5 years). All patients manifested with headache and hypertension (systolic and diastolic blood pressure 174.9 +/- 14.1 and 123.7 +/- 17.0 mmHg, respectively). Another presenting symptoms include decreased visual acuity (n=4), hyperhidrosis (n=3), weight loss (n=2), and seizure (n=1). Initial height- and weight-SDS were -0.1 +/- 0.9 and -1.0 +/- 0.6, respectively. A diagnosis was made by elevated 24 hour urine total metanephrine (5.8 +/- 3.7 mg/day) in 6 patients and by elevated 24 hour urine norepinephrine (2968.7 +/- 3295.3 mu g/day). Computerized tomography demonstrated tumors in adrenal gland; 5 in right side, 1 in left side, and 1 in bilateral. Hypertensive retinopathy (n=4) and left ventricular hypertrophy (n=4) were observed as complications of hypertension. VHL gene mutations were identified in 2 patients; one patient had previously diagnosed retinal hemangioma and the other developed contralateral pheochromocytoma after 12 years later. The other 5 patients did not reveal the features suggesting genetic syndromes. Phenoxybenzamine (n=4) was the most frequently used antihypertensive medication, and the duration of preoperative blood control was 20.6 +/- 7.7 days. All patients had hypertensive episodes during the surgery, which were controlled by intravenous nitroprusside. One patient experienced postoperative hypotension and required intravenous phenylephrine. During follow up no tumor recurrence was observed. Conclusions: Most patients initially presented symptoms associated with uncontrolled hypertension. Because pheochromocytoma could be the initial presentation of tumor-predisposing syndrome, regular monitoring is necessary after tumor resection.

N2  - Pheochromocytoma is a rare chromaffin cell tumor that is may be associated with a genetic predisposition, such as Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. VHL is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by a predisposition to multiple tumors including retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma and pheochromocytomas. The classic presentation of pheochromocytoma is episodic hypertension, headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis. In the pediatric population, 40% of pheochromocytomas have a hereditary basis. We present a case of metastatic pheochromocytoma in a child with VHL and discuss the relevant current medical literature.

N2  - Targeted therapy against VEGF and mTOR pathways has been established as the standard-of-care for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); however, these treatments frequently fail and most patients become refractory requiring subsequent alternative therapeutic options. Therefore, development of innovative and effective treatments is imperative. About 80%-90% of ccRCC tumors express an inactive mutant form of the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes target protein degradation. Strong genetic and experimental evidence supports the correlate that pVHL functional loss leads to the accumulation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 2alpha (HIF2alpha) and that an overabundance of HIF2alpha functions as a tumorigenic driver of ccRCC. In this report, we describe an RNAi therapeutic for HIF2alpha that utilizes a targeting ligand that selectively binds to integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 frequently overexpressed in ccRCC. We demonstrate that functional delivery of a HIF2alpha-specific RNAi trigger resulted in HIF2alpha gene silencing and subsequent tumor growth inhibition and degeneration in an established orthotopic ccRCC xenograft model.

N2  - Genetics in nephrology, nephrogenetics, is a rapidly developing field. Management of many nephrological disorders now relies on nephrogenetics. For instance early therapy is possible following molecular diagnosis in Alport syndrom and Fabry disease; furthermore molecular diagnosis helps in decision making for expensive and cumbersome therapies, such as in aHUS, cystinosis, ADPKD, and tuberous sclerosis; effects transplantation and kidney donation in APOL1-associated FSGS and hyperoxaluria; and facilitates early detection of severe complications as in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and with WT1 mutations.

N2  - Endolymphatic sac tumour (ELST) is infrequent, as emerges from small series reported in the literature. It is a slow-growing malignancy with local aggressiveness and a low risk of distant metastases. It is often misdiagnosed because of the late onset of symptoms and difficulty in obtaining a biopsy. Its frequency is higher in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease (a genetic systemic syndrome involving multiple tumours), with a prevalence of around 25%. The diagnosis is based on radiology, with specific patterns on contrast-enhanced MRI and typical petrous bone erosion on bone CT scan. Our experience of ELST in the years between 2012-2015 concerns 7 cases, one of which was bilateral, in patients with VHL disease. Four of the 7 patients underwent 5 surgical procedures at our institution. Each case is described in detail, including clinical symptoms, and the intervals between symptom onset, diagnosis and therapy. Postoperative morbidity was low after early surgery on small tumours, whereas extensive surgery for large tumours was associated with loss of cranial nerve function (especially VII, IX, X). The critical sites coinciding with loss of neurological function were the fallopian canal, jugular foramen, petrous apex and intradural extension into the posterior cranial fossa. Early surgery on small ELST is advocated for patients with VHL disease, in whom screening enables a prompt diagnosis and consequently good prognosis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with a different clinical behavior and response to targeted therapies. Differences in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) expression have been used to classify von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL)-deficient ccRCC tumors. c-Myc may be driving proliferation in HIF-2alpha-expressing tumors in a growth factor-independent manner.OBJECTIVE: To explore the HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha and c-Myc baseline expression as potential predictors of sunitinib outcome as well as the effectiveness and safety with sunitinib in patients with metastatic ccRCC in routine clinical practice.METHODS: This was an observational and prospective study involving 10 Spanish hospitals. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples from metastatic ccRCC patients who received sunitinib as first-line treatment were analyzed. Association between biomarker expression and sunitinib treatment outcomes was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier method was applied to measure progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were included: median PFS was 10.8 months (95% CI: 7.4-13.5 months), median overall survival was 21.8 months (95% CI: 14.7-29.8 months) and objective response rate was 40.7%, with 7.4% of patients achieving a complete response. Molecular marker staining was performed in the 69 available tumor samples. Significant association with lower PFS was identified for double c-Myc/HIF-2alpha-positive staining tumors (median 4.3 vs 11.5 months, hazard ratio =2.64, 95% CI: 1.03-6.80, P=0.036). A trend toward a lower PFS was found in positive c-Myc tumors (median 5.9 vs 10.9 months, P=0.263). HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression levels were not associated with clinical outcome.CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that predictive subgroups might be defined based on biomarkers such as c-Myc/HIF-2alpha. Further validation with more patients will be needed in order to confirm it. Outcomes with sunitinib in metastatic ccRCC in daily clinical practice resemble those obtained in clinical trials.

N2  - Background Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood of cancer patients is regarded as an important step towards personalized medicine and treatment monitoring. In the present study, we investigated the clinical applicability of ctDNA as liquid biopsy in renal cancer. Methods ctDNA in serum and plasma samples derived from ccRCC and colon cancer patients as well as ctDNA isolated from RCC xenografts with known VHL mutation status was investigated using next generation sequencing (NGS). Additionally, a Taqman mutation specific assay was used for specific VHL mutation detection in blood. Results In our study, we successfully identified KRAS mutation in colon cancer patients. We also confirmed the presence of specific VHL mutations in ctDNA derived from RCC xenografts indicating the capability of renal tumors to release DNA into the blood circulation. However, we could not detect any VHL mutation in plasma or serum samples derived from nine ccRCC patients. To increase the sensitivity, a VHL mutation specific Taqman assay was tested. With this approach, the pVHL mutation p.Val130Leu in exon 2 in one patient was successfully detected. Conclusion These data suggest a reduced tumor DNA shedding and an increased clearance of the tumor DNA from the circulation in renal cancer patients independently of tumor size, metastases, and necrosis. This implies that highly sensitive detection methods for mutation calling and prior knowledge of the mutation are required for liquid biopsies in ccRCC. Copyright © 2017

N2  - Background: Although widely regarded as rare epithelial tumors with a low grade of malignancy, endolymphatic sac tumors (ELST) often lead to disabling petrous bone destruction and significantly impairing symptoms at the time of primary diagnosis and/or recurrence. ELST is not uncommon in von Hippel Lindau (VHL) patients. Although open surgery is regarded as the best treatment option, recurrence remains a challenge, particularly when gross tumor resection (GTR) is deemed unachievable due to topographic conditions. Tumor recurrence successfully treated with fractionated radiotherapy and radiosurgery have been reported in selected cases. We present the case of a patient with recurrent ELST treated with salvage gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) adding a review of current literature.Case Description: A 65-year-old patient underwent GKRS of an unresectable, recurrent ELST. Tumor volumetric analysis showed almost 15% increase in tumor volume in the 4 months between the pre-GKRS magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the stereotactic MRI (s-MRI) at treatment. Follow-up MRI at 12 and 20 months showed significant decrease in local tumor volume, decreased contrast enhancement and no perifocal edema. The patient's general and neurological status remains stable to the present day.Conclusion: In the present case, GKRS was effective in the management of a recurrent ELST over the course of 20 months. Because of ELSTs recurrence potential, long-term follow up is required. The present case as well as previous reports might suggest a possible salvage/adjunctive role of radiosurgery in the management of ELST. Further studies are deemed necessary.

N2  - Clear cell neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the pancreas is found in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), and sporadic form. Clear cell NETs are often misdiagnosed as metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A 47-year-old woman with VHL was found to have a mass in the pancreatic tail and two masses in the right kidney with two cysts. A distal pancreatectomy and right radical nephrectomy were performed. The pancreatic lesion was a well-circumscribed, golden-yellow solid mass, which was lobulated by septal fibrosis. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of entirely of clear cells with prominent nucleoli. The tumor cell nests were separated by collagen fibrosis. Immunohistochemical studies were positive for the neuroendocrine markers and vimentin. Synchronous kidney tumors were clear cell renal cell carcinoma and cystic renal cell carcinoma. Those with syndrome are younger than those without syndrome. Sporadic tumors have larger size and higher grade than those of VHL and MEN I. Stromal sclerosis is frequently observed in VHL, compared with the other two groups. In the absence of a documented genetic profile and family history, awareness of these features should help us to diagnose clear cell pancreatic NETs resembling metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - Survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has improved since the advent of targeted therapy. Approved agents include the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, pazopanib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib (approved in combination with everolimus), the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors everolimus and temsirolimus, and the programmed death-1 (PD-1) targeted immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. The identification of predictive and prognostic factors of survival is increasing, and both clinical predictive factors and pathology-related prognostic factors are being evaluated. Serum-based biomarkers and certain histologic subtypes of RCC, as well as clinical factors such as dose intensity and the development of some class effect adverse events, have been identified as predictors of survival. Expression levels of microRNAs, expression of chemokine receptor 4, hypermethylation of certain genes, VEGF polymorphisms, and elevation of plasma fibrinogen or d-dimer have been shown to be prognostic indicators of survival. In the future, prognosis and treatment of patients with mRCC might be based on genomic classification, especially of the 4 most commonly mutated genes in RCC (VHL, PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2). Median overall survival has improved for patients treated with a first-line targeted agent compared with survival of patients treated with first-line interferon-alpha, and results of clinical trials have shown a survival benefit of sequential treatment with targeted agents. Prognosis of patients with mRCC will likely improve with optimization and individualization of current sequential treatment with targeted agents.

N2  - mTORC1 inhibitors were first approved for the use in metastatic kidney cancer. However, observed treatment benefit was highly heterogeneous among patients. Through case-based cancer genomic sequencing of therapeutic outliers, we can begin to appreciate the convergent evolution of given cancer pathways/ phenotypes beyond genes in kidney cancer, like a braided river.

N2  - Despite interest in associating polymorphisms with clinical or experimental phenotypes, functional interpretation of mutation data has lagged behind generation of data from modern high-throughput techniques and the accurate prediction of the molecular impact of a mutation remains a non-trivial task. We present here an integrated knowledge-driven computational workflow designed to evaluate the effects of experimental and disease missense mutations on protein structure and interactions. We exemplify its application with analyses of saturation mutagenesis of DBR1 and Gal4 and show that the experimental phenotypes for over 80% of the mutations correlate well with predicted effects of mutations on protein stability and RNA binding affinity. We also show that analysis of mutations in VHL using our workflow provides valuable insights into the effects of mutations, and their links to the risk of developing renal carcinoma. Taken together the analyses of the three examples demonstrate that structural bioinformatics tools, when applied in a systematic, integrated way, can rapidly analyse a given system to provide a powerful approach for predicting structural and functional effects of thousands of mutations in order to reveal molecular mechanisms leading to a phenotype. Missense or non-synonymous mutations are nucleotide substitutions that alter the amino acid sequence of a protein. Their effects can range from modifying transcription, translation, processing and splicing, localization, changing stability of the protein, altering its dynamics or interactions with other proteins, nucleic acids and ligands, including small molecules and metal ions. The advent of high-throughput techniques including sequencing and saturation mutagenesis has provided large amounts of phenotypic data linked to mutations. However, one of the hurdles has been understanding and quantifying the effects of a particular mutation, and how they translate into a given phenotype. One approach to overcome this is to use robust, accurate and scalable computational methods to understand and correlate structural effects of mutations with disease.

N2  - Von Hippel-Landau (VHL) protein is a potent tumor suppressor regulating numerous pathways that drive cancer, but mutations in VHL are restricted to limited subsets of malignancies. Here we identified a novel mechanism for VHL suppression in tumors that do not have inactivating mutations. Using developmental processes to uncover new pathways contributing to tumorigenesis, we found that Daam2 promotes glioma formation. Protein expression screening identified an inverse correlation between Daam2 and VHL expression across a host of cancers, including glioma. These in silico insights guided corroborating functional studies, which revealed that Daam2 promotes tumorigenesis by suppressing VHL expression. Furthermore, biochemical analyses demonstrate that Daam2 associates with VHL and facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation. Together, these studies are the first to define an upstream mechanism regulating VHL suppression in cancer and describe the role of Daam2 in tumorigenesis. Copyright © Zhu et al.

N2  - Two recent independent studies published in Nature show robust responses of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines, preclinical ccRCC xenograft models and, remarkably, a patient with progressive ccRCC despite receiving multiple lines of treatment, to the long-awaited, recently developed inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha (HIF2alpha). This commentary published in Endocrine-Related Cancer is based on the recognition of similar molecular drivers in ccRCC and the endocrine neoplasias pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs), ultimately leading to stabilization of HIFs. HIF-stabilizing mutations have been detected in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, as well as in other genes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx), fumarate hydratase (FH) and transcription elongation factor B subunit 1 (TCEB1), as well as the gene that encodes HIF2alpha itself: EPAS1<sup>HIF2alpha</sup> Importantly, the recent discovery of EPAS1 mutations in PPGLs and the results of comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies revealing their oncogenic roles characterized a hitherto unknown direct mechanism of HIF2alpha activation in human cancer. The now available therapeutic opportunity to successfully inhibit HIF2alpha pharmacologically with PT2385 and PT2399 will certainly spearhead a series of investigations in several types of cancers, including patients with SDHB-related metastatic PPGL for whom limited therapeutic options are currently available. Future studies will determine the efficacy of these promising drugs against the hotspot EPAS1 mutations affecting HIF2alpha amino acids 529-532 (in PPGLs) and amino acids 533-540 (in erythrocytosis type 4), as well as against HIF2alpha protein activated by VHL, SDHx and FH mutations in PPGL-derived chromatin cells.

N2  - Ubiquitin ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) negatively regulates protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha). Loss of pVHL causes HIF-alpha accumulation, which contributes to the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. In contrast, v-Myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog-like 2 (MYBL2; B-Myb), a transcription factor, prevents VHL pathogenesis by regulating gene expression of HIF-independent pathways. Both HIF-alpha and B-Myb are targets of pVHL-mediated polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Here, we show that knockdown of HIF-2alpha induces downregulation of B-Myb in 786-O cells, which are deficient in pVHL, and this downregulation is prevented by proteasome inhibition. In the presence of pVHL and under hypoxia-like conditions, B-Myb and HIF-2alpha are both upregulated, and the upregulation of B-Myb requires expression of HIF-2alpha. We also show that HIF-2alpha and B-Myb interact in the nucleus, and this interaction is mediated by the central region of HIF-2alpha and the C-terminal region of B-Myb. These data indicate that oncogenic HIF-2alpha stabilizes B-Myb to suppress VHL pathogenesis.

N2  - The metabolic phenotype of cancer cells is reflected by the metabolites they consume and by the byproducts they release. Here, we use quantitative, extracellular metabolomic data of the NCI-60 panel and a novel computational method to generate 120 condition-specific cancer cell line metabolic models. These condition-specific cancer models used distinct metabolic strategies to generate energy and cofactors. The analysis of the models' capability to deal with environmental perturbations revealed three oxotypes, differing in the range of allowable oxygen uptake rates. Interestingly, models based on metabolomic profiles of melanoma cells were distinguished from other models through their low oxygen uptake rates, which were associated with a glycolytic phenotype. A subset of the melanoma cell models required reductive carboxylation. The analysis of protein and RNA expression levels from the Human Protein Atlas showed that IDH2, which was an essential gene in the melanoma models, but not IDH1 protein, was detected in normal skin cell types and melanoma. Moreover, the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) protein, whose loss is associated with non-hypoxic HIF-stabilization, reductive carboxylation, and promotion of glycolysis, was uniformly absent in melanoma. Thus, the experimental data supported the predicted role of IDH2 and the absence of VHL protein supported the glycolytic and low oxygen phenotype predicted for melanoma. Taken together, our approach of integrating extracellular metabolomic data with metabolic modeling and the combination of different network interrogation methods allowed insights into the metabolism of cells.

N2  - The past two decades have brought many important advances in our understanding of the hereditary susceptibility to cancer. Numerous studies have provided convincing evidence that identification of germline mutations associated with hereditary cancer syndromes can lead to reductions in morbidity and mortality through targeted risk management options. Additionally, advances in gene sequencing technology now permit the development of multigene hereditary cancer testing panels. Here, we describe the 2016 revision of the Counsyl Inherited Cancer Screen for detecting single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels), and copy number variants (CNVs) in 36 genes associated with an elevated risk for breast, ovarian, colorectal, gastric, endometrial, pancreatic, thyroid, prostate, melanoma, and neuroendocrine cancers. To determine test accuracy and reproducibility, we performed a rigorous analytical validation across 341 samples, including 118 cell lines and 223 patient samples. The screen achieved 100% test sensitivity across different mutation types, with high specificity and 100% concordance with conventional Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). We also demonstrated the screen's high intra-run and inter-run reproducibility and robust performance on blood and saliva specimens. Furthermore, we showed that pathogenic Alu element insertions can be accurately detected by our test. Overall, the validation in our clinical laboratory demonstrated the analytical performance required for collecting and reporting genetic information related to risk of developing hereditary cancers.

N2  - Introduction: Congenital erythrocytosis is by definition present from birth. Patients frequently present in childhood or as young adults and a family history may be present. The erythrocytosis can be primary where there is a defect in the erythroid compartment of secondary where increased erythropoietin production produced due to the defect leads to an erythrocytosis. Material and methods: Primary causes include erythropoietin receptor mutations. Congenital secondary causes include mutations in the genes involved in the oxygen-sensing pathway and haemoglobins with abnormal oxygen affinity. Investigations for the cause include an erythropoietin level, oxygen dissociation curve, haemoglobin electrophoresis and sequencing for known gene variants. Results: The finding of a known or new molecular variant confirms a diagnosis of congenital erythrocytosis. A congenital erythrocytosis may be an incidental finding but nonspecific symptoms are described. Major thromboembolic events have been noted in some cases. Low-dose aspirin and venesection are therapeutic manoeuvres which should be considered in managing these patients. Conclusions: Rare individuals presenting often at a young age may have a congenital erythrocytosis. Molecular investigation may reveal a lesion. However, in the majority, currently no defect is identified. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - Endocrine tumor syndromes, eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2, were among the first recognized hereditary predisposition syndromes to tumor development. Over time, the number of endocrine tumor syndromes has significantly expanded, eg, with the recent inclusion of hereditary paraganglioma syndromes. Associations of non-endocrine tumors with hereditary endocrine tumor syndromes and endocrine tumors with non-classical endocrine tumor syndromes have emerged. These findings have certainly expanded the scope of care, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach by a team of medical professionals and researchers, integrating shared patient decision-making at every step of surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines, multiple aspects of patient care remain individualized, based on a patient's clinical presentation and family pedigree. This is particularly important when determining a surveillance plan for unaffected or disease-free mutation carriers. In this review, we describe the main endocrine tumor manifestations found in familial cancer syndromes in an organ-based approach, focusing on adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, neuroendocrine tumors, differentiated thyroid cancer, and medullary thyroid cancer. We highlight the challenges in diagnosis, surveillance, and therapy unique to the patient population with hereditary syndromes. Furthermore, we underscore the importance of evaluating for genetic predisposition to tumor development, provide features that can identify index patients, and discuss the approach to screening surveillance for mutation carriers.

N2  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) affects approximately one-third of diabetic patients and, if left untreated, progresses to proliferative DR (PDR) with associated vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, iris neovascularization, glaucoma and irreversible blindness. In vitreous samples of human patients with PDR, we found elevated levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha). HIFs are transcription factors that promote hypoxia adaptation and have important functional roles in a wide range of ischemic and inflammatory diseases. To recreate the human PDR phenotype for a preclinical animal model, we generated a mouse with neuroretinal-specific loss of the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein, a protein that targets HIF1alpha for ubiquitination. We found that the neuroretinal cells in these mice overexpressed HIF1alpha and developed severe, irreversible ischemic retinopathy that has features of human PDR. Rapid progression of retinopathy in these mutant mice should facilitate the evaluation of therapeutic agents for ischemic and inflammatory blinding disorders. In addition, this model system can be used to manipulate the modulation of the hypoxia signaling pathways, for the treatment of non-ocular ischemic and inflammatory disorders.

N2  - Genetic mutations of phaeochromocytoma (PCC) and paraganglioma (PGL) are mainly classified into two major clusters. Cluster 1 mutations are involved with the pseudo hypoxic pathway and comprised of PHD2, VHL, SDHx, IDH, HIF2A, MDH2 and FH mutated PCC/PGL. Cluster 2 mutations are associated with abnormal activation of kinase signalling pathways and included mutations of RET, NF1, KIF1Bbeta, MAX and TMEM127. In addition, VHL, SDHx (cluster 1 genes) and RET, NF1 (cluster 2 genes) germline mutations are involved in the neuronal precursor cell pathway in the pathogeneses of PCC/PGL. Also, GDNF, H-ras, K-ras, GNAS, CDKN2A (p16), p53, BAP1, BRCA1&2, ATRX and KMT2D mutations have roles in the development of PCC/PGLs. Overall, known genetic mutations account for the pathogenesis of approximately 60% of PCC/PGLs. Genetic mutations, pathological parameters and biochemical markers are used for better prediction of the outcome of patients with this group of tumours. Immunohistochemistry and gene sequencing can ensure a more effective detection, prediction of malignant potential and treatment of PCC/PCLs. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene. VHL loss drives tumor angiogenesis and accounts for the clinical activity of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the first-line standard of care for advanced RCC. Within the last year, three new second-line treatments have received FDA approval for use after anti-angiogenic therapy: the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, the TKI cabozantinib, and the combination of the TKI lenvatinib and the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Cabozantinib inhibits VEGFRs, MET, and AXL, kinases that promote tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Compared with everolimus, cabozantinib has shown statistically significant improvements in the three key efficacy endpoints of overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate in patients with RCC who were previously treated with a VEGFR TKI. Herein, we summarize the translational research and clinical development that led to approval of cabozantinib as second-line therapy in RCC.

N2  - The hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and its microRNA target, miR-210, are candidate tumor-drivers of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Neuroendocrine neoplasms such as paragangliomas (PGLs) are particularly appealing for understanding the cancer metabolic adjustments because of their associations with deregulations of metabolic enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene involved in HIF-1alpha stabilization. However, the role of miR-210 in the pathogenesis of SDH-related tumors remains an unmet challenge. Herein is described an in vivo genetic analysis of the role of VHL, HIF1A and SDH on miR-210 by using knockout murine models, siRNA gene silencing, and analyses of human tumors. HIF-1a knockout abolished hypoxia-induced miR-210 expression in vivo but did not alter its constitutive expression in paraganglia. Normoxic miR-210 levels substantially increased by complete, but not partial, VHL silencing in paraganglia of knockout VHL-mice and by over-expression of p76del-mutated pVHL. Similarly, VHLmutated PGLs, not those with decreased VHL-gene/mRNA dosage, over-expressed miR-210 and accumulate HIF-1a in most tumor cells. Ablation of SDH activity in SDHD-null cell lines or reduction of the SDHD or SDHB protein levels elicited by siRNA-induced gene silencing did not induce miR-210 whereas the presence of SDH mutations in PGLs and tumor-derived cell lines was associated with mild increase of miR-210 and the presence of a heterogeneous, HIF-1a-positive and HIF-1a-negative, tumor cell population. Thus, activation of HIF-1a is likely an early event in VHLdefective PGLs directly linked to VHL mutations, but it is a late event favored but not directly triggered by SDHx mutations. This combined analysis provides insights into the mechanisms of HIF-1a/miR-210 regulation in normal and tumor tissues potentially useful for understanding the pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases sharing similar underpinnings.

N2  - Cancer cells can inhibit effector T cells (Teff) through both immunomodulatory receptors and the impact of cancer metabolism on the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, Teff require high rates of glucose metabolism, and consumption of essential nutrients or generation of waste products by tumor cells may impede essential T cell metabolic pathways. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by loss of the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and altered cancer cell metabolism. Here, we assessed how ccRCC influences the metabolism and activation of primary patient ccRCC tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). CD8 TIL were abundant in ccRCC, but they were phenotypically distinct and both functionally and metabolically impaired. ccRCC CD8 TIL were unable to efficiently uptake glucose or perform glycolysis and had small, fragmented mitochondria that were hyperpolarized and generated large amounts of ROS. Elevated ROS was associated with downregulated mitochondrial SOD2. CD8 T cells with hyperpolarized mitochondria were also visible in the blood of ccRCC patients. Importantly, provision of pyruvate to bypass glycolytic defects or scavengers to neutralize mitochondrial ROS could partially restore TIL activation. Thus, strategies to improve metabolic function of ccRCC CD8 TIL may promote the immune response to ccRCC.

N2  - Background: Intratumour heterogeneity has been studied extensively in primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) but not in metastatic cases. Our study aims to identify the pattern of metastatic tumour heterogeneity by analysing DNA mutations and mRNA expression in primary tumours and metastases of ccRCC patients. Methods: PCR-based targeted sequencing was performed on 48 FFPE samples from five patients, of which 21 were from the primary tumours, 22 from metastases, and five from normal kidney tissues. The custom panel consists of 73 most common genes in ccRCC based on TCGA database. In each patient, DNA and RNA from different tumour grades were isolated separately in serial sections of paraffin blocks. The sequencing result was analysed by our in house pipeline. Transcriptome sequencing with a library preparation that specifically captures the 3'-end of each mRNA, was performed on the same samples. The reads were aligned using hisat and gene-level quantification was performed by HTSeq. Results: Ubiquitous and local mutations were identified in different regions of the primary tumour and metastases from each patient. The VHL gene was the only gene that consistently showed identical mutations for every patient in all primary tumour sections and metastases for 3 out of 5 patients. In some tumour regions of the remaining 2 patients, no VHL mutations were observed but coverage of that gene was low. Overall, VHL mutations were identified in 37/43 tumour samples (86%) across all 5 patients. No specific mutation was characteristic for metastases. In contrast, DESeq2 analysis of the mRNA data showed 308 genes to be differentially expressed between primary tumours and metastases (padj<0.01). Functional annotation analysis of these 308 genes showed a significant enrichment in the 'extracellular space' cluster (P value after Benjamini correction = 2,4E-13), suggesting that microenvironment has an important role in themetastases. Principle component analyses displayed that 'patient' was the most dominant variable. Thus, further analysis of our dataset was performed per patient. Sample-sample Euclidian distance measurements showed that themetastases cluster separately from primary tumours in all five patients. In 2 patients, the sample-sample distances were higher in the primary tumours than in the metastases, suggesting more heterogeneity in the primary tumours. In contrast, in the 3 other patients, the sample-sample distances were higher in metastases. Expression analysis of only 33 genes from the ClearCode34 gene set showed similar sample-to sample distances. Conclusions: Tumour heterogeneity is present within multiple sections of the primary tumours and between different metastases of the same patient. Molecular tumour profiling regarding treatment preferences in metastatic ccRCC should be made based on sampling of the primary tumour and multiple metastatic lesions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Historically, the survival of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) has been poorer than that of the general population. We aimed to determine whether the survival of VHL mutation carriers and their risk of vHL-related death has changed over time and how it has been affected by sex, genotype and surveillance attendance.METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we included all known Danish vHL families with a VHL mutation. We assessed the survival and causes of death for 143 VHL mutation carriers using Cox regression models and compared vHL survival with that of 137 siblings without vHL. vHL life expectancy was compared with the general population using a relative survival model.RESULTS: The estimated mean life expectancies for male and female patients born in 2000 were 67 and 60 years, respectively. Survival is influenced by the sex and genotype of the patient. Female patients have a significantly higher risk of vHL-related death than male patients (HR=2.25, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.20, p=0.011). Overall, 79% (53 of 67) of deaths were vHL-related, but the risk of vHL-related death has decreased over time, as has the frequency of renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-related death. Surveillance is especially beneficial for truncating mutation carriers, who have the greatest RCC and central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastoma risk.CONCLUSIONS: vHL survival has improved over time and has become closer to that of siblings without vHL and the general population. Even though the risk of vHL-related death has decreased significantly, the main cause of death is still CNS hemangioblastomas and hence improved treatment options are essential.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an onco-suppressor involved in oxygen and energy-dependent promotion of protein ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Loss of function mutations of VHL (VHL-cells) result in organ specific cancers with the best studied example in renal cell carcinomas. VHL has a well-established role in deactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and in regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR activity. Cell culture metabolomics analysis was utilized to determined effect of VHL and HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha on metabolism of renal cell carcinomas (RCC). RCC cells were stably transfected with VHL or shRNA designed to silence HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha genes. Obtained metabolic data was analysed qualitatively, searching for overall effects on metabolism as well as quantitatively, using methods developed in our group in order to determine specific metabolic changes. Analysis of the effect of VHL and HIF silencing on cellular metabolic footprints and fingerprints provided information about the metabolic pathways affected by VHL through HIF function as well as independently of HIF. Through correlation network analysis as well as statistical analysis of significant metabolic changes we have determined effects of VHL and HIF on energy production, amino acid metabolism, choline metabolism as well as cell regulation and signaling. VHL was shown to influence cellular metabolism through its effect on HIF proteins as well as by affecting activity of other factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Upregulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) may mediate resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-directed therapies and inhibit antitumor immunity. Antagonism of S1P in preclinical models appears to overcome this resistance. In this phase 2 study, the authors assessed the activity of sonepcizumab, a first-in-class inhibitor of S1P, in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) with a history of prior VEGF-directed therapy.METHODS: Patients were required to have clear cell mRCC and to have received treatment with at least 1 prior VEGF-directed agent. Prior treatment with immunotherapeutic agents and <=1 mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors was permitted. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival. Additional endpoints included response rate and safety, and overall survival (OS) performed post hoc.RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled with a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 1-5 prior therapies), 78% of whom had intermediate-risk disease by second-line International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) criteria. Although the current study did not achieve its primary endpoint based on the 2-month progression-free survival, a median OS of 21.7 months was observed. Four patients (10%) demonstrated a partial response, with a median duration of response of 5.9 months. No grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in >5% of patients (adverse events were graded and recorded for each patient using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]); the most frequent grade 1/2 treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (30%), weight gain (18%), constipation (15%), and nausea (15%). Biomarker studies demonstrated an increase in S1P concentrations with therapy. Comprehensive genomic profiling of 3 patients with a clinical benefit of >24 months indicated von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and polybromo-1 (PBRM1) alterations.CONCLUSIONS: The encouraging OS and favorable safety profile observed with sonepcizumab should prompt further investigation of the agent in combination with VEGF-directed agents or checkpoint inhibitors.

N2  - Purpose:To illustrate spontaneous resolution of macular epiretinal membranes and inactivation of retinal hemangioma exudation after fluorescein potentiated argon laser treatment of bilateral capillary hemangiomas in a patient with a de novo heterozygous deletion in Exon 2 of the von Hippel-Lindau gene. Methods: Interventional case report. Results: A 23-year-old man with subjective complaints of blurry vision, photophobia, and glare. On presentation, visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye with metamorphopsia. On the basis of bilateral retinal hemangiomas on clinical examination and characterization with multimodal imaging, a diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease was made. Genetic testing identified a de novo, disease-causing heterozygous deletion in Exon 2 of the von Hippel-Lindau gene. The patient underwent 4 sessions of fluorescein potentiated 532 nm argon green laser treatment directed at retinal hemangiomas. No adverse sequelae of laser treatment were noted. Seven months after the initial presentation, the patient's vision was 20/20 in both eyes with interval resolution of metamorphopsia. There was spontaneous resolution of a macular epiretinal membrane with normalization of the macular retinal microstructure. The retinal hemangiomas in both eyes appeared inactive, and no new lesions were noted. Conclusion: Fluorescein potentiated argon laser successfully treated bilateral retinal hemangiomas in our patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Additional studies to characterize the full clinical potential of fluorescein potentiated argon laser therapy may be warranted. Copyringht Copyright © by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.

N2  - Background: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that occurs as a consequence of an inactivation of the VHL gene. Point mutations in VHL are a major cause for VHL disease, and fragment deletions contribute to ~30% of VHL patients. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (Array-CGH) is a powerful tool for the identification of genomic deletions, and often reveals unexpected information as a non-targeted method. Method: We extracted the DNA from the patients' blood andscreened for point mutations in VHL by PCR and large deletions by Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (Array-CGH). Real-time quantitative PCR was used to confirm the deletion of VHL gene and expression of VHL in tumor tissue. Results: We present a family case of VHL syndrome, showing hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system and retina, multiple pancreatic cysts and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. After excluding point mutations in VHL gene exons and conjunctive regions, we identified a ~9 kb deletion of chromosome 3p25.3 with Array-CGH analysis. Real-time PCR confirmed a heterozygous deletion in exon 3 of the VHL gene. Additional 90 DNA deletions were detected ranging from 5 kb to 160 kb in size. Moreover, 70.3% of the breakpoints were located in Alu elements. Conclusions: This study confirmed that DNA deletions contribute to familial VHL disease. It also highlights that coding deletions appear to be more frequent than expected, and that Alu-mediated recombination is the major mechanism. Copyright © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is a hereditary tumor predisposition caused by mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. VHL mutation-carriers are at life-long risk of multi-organ tumor development. The mainstay of vHL management is close surveillance and surgical tumor removal. The disease has been reported to be fully penetrant at 60 years of age, and has a highly variable phenotype, which complicates vHL management and causes distress and uncertainty for affected families. vHL survival has historically been poorer than the survival of the general population, with a median life expectancy for vHL patients of only 49 years. vHL life expectancy is expected to be improved by better surveillance, tumor diagnosis, and treatment approaches, although this has notyet been directly demonstrated. The prevalence of vHL is between 1 in 39,000 and 1 in 91,000 individuals, and the birth incidence is between 1 in 36,000 and 1 in 45,500 live births in different populations. Based on these estimates, vHL is underdiagnosed in Denmark, and many undiagnosed families are not offered genetic counseling or prophylactic surveillance.We aimed to assess 1) how the rate of new manifestation development is influenced by age, sex, genotype, tumor location, and pregnancy, 2) how vHL survival has developed over time, and is affected by sex, genotype, and surveillance attendance, 3) to determine the prevalence and incidence of vHL, and 4) to calculate vHL penetrance based on an unselected national cohort. We included almost all diagnosed vHL patients in Denmark in a retrospective cohort study. We further used the national health registers to find individuals who had a missed vHL diagnosis despite fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria.We found that the risk of new vHL manifestations varies with age, genotype, and tumor location. The risk of new retinal tumors is highest in the patients' teenage years, while cerebellar tumors developed at the highest rates in patients' thirties. Patients with truncating mutations had higher rates of new manifestation diagnosis than patients with missense mutations. Men tend to have higher manifestation rates in adulthood compared to women, and pregnancy was associated with a lower frequency of new manifestations. vHL survival has improved over time, and is getting closer to that of their siblings without vHL and the general population. Survival is significantly influenced by a patient's birth year, sex, and genotype. We estimate the mean life expectancy of VHL mutation-carriers born in 2000 to be 67 years for men and 60 years for women. We estimate the vHL prevalence to be about 1 in 46,900 individuals and the birth incidence to be about 1 in 27,300 live births. We found a penetrance at age 60 of 87%, and only 80% among pa-tients who have not attended surveillance prior to diagnosis, which is considerably lower than previous estimates. Our findings form the basis of a more targeted vHL surveillance and counseling. The lower age-related penetrance greatly influences risk assessment in a clinical genetic setting. Even though the prevalence has increased over recent years, vHL is still underdiagnosed, and there is a need for increased awareness about the disease.

N2  - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited syndrome manifesting with benign and malignant tumors. Deficiency of carnitine palmitoyltransferase type II (CPT2) is a disorder of lipid metabolism that, in the muscle form, manifests with recurrent attacks of myalgias often associated with myoglobinuria. Rhabdomyolytic episodes may be complicated by life-threatening events, including acute renal failure (ARF). We report on a male patient who was tested, at 10 years of age, for VHL disease because of family history of VHL. He was diagnosed with VHL but without VHL-related manifestation at the time of diagnosis. During childhood, the patient was hospitalized several times for diffuse muscular pain, muscle weakness, and dark urine. These recurrent attacks of rhabdomyolysis were never accompanied by ARF. The patient was found to be homozygous for the mutation p.S113L of the CPT2 gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the coexistence of VHL disease and CPT2 deficiency in the same individual. Based on findings from animal models, the case illustrates that mutations in the VHL gene might protect against renal damage caused by CPT2 gene mutations.

N2  - Purpose: Several new gene mutations have been reported in recent years to be associated with a risk of familial pheochromocytoma. However, it is unclear as to whether extensive genetic testing is required in all patients. Methods: The clinical data of consecutive patients operated for pheochromocytoma over a decade in a tertiary referral center were reviewed. Genetic screening was performed using a 10-gene panel: RET, VHL, SDHB, SDHD, SDHA, SDHC, SDHAF2, MAX, TMEM127 and FH. Results: A total of 166 patients were analyzed: 87 of them had genetic screening performed (39 M: 44.8%, 48 F: 55.2%, age range 6-81 years, mean 45+/-16.8 years). In total, 22/87 (25.3%) patients had germline mutations, while 65/87 (74.7%) patients presented with apparently sporadic tumors. Germline VHL mutations were identified in 11.7% of patients, RET in 6.8% (five MEN2A/MEN2 and one MEN2B/MEN3), SDHD in 2.3%, MAX in 2.3%, SDHB in 1.1%, and TMEM127 in 1.1% of patients. At diagnosis, 15.1% of patients with unilateral non-syndromic pheochromocytoma showed germline mutations. We identified 19.7% of mutations in patients with unilateral-non-recurrent pheochromocytomas within 5 years vs. 50% in the recurrent-bilateral-metastatic group (p = 0.01). Germline mutations were more frequently seen with bilateral pheochromocytomas (p = 0.001): 80% of patients with bilateral disease had germline mutations (4 VHL, 3 RET, 1 MAX). Conclusions: The advent of rapid genetic screening using a gene-panel makes it feasible to screen large cohorts of patients and provides a valuable tool to contribute to the prediction of bilateral and malignant disease and to screen family members.

N2  - Objective.: The importance of hypomethylation in SLE is well recognized; however, the significance of hypermethylation has not been well characterized. We screened hypermethylated marks in SLE and investigated their possible implications.Methods.: DNA methylation marks were screened in SLE whole-blood DNA by microarray, and two marks ( CD3Z and VHL hypermethylations) were confirmed by a methylation single-base extension method in two independent ethnic cohorts consisting of 207 SLE patients and 151 controls. The correlation with clinical manifestations and the genetic influence on those epigenetic marks were analysed.Results.: Two epigenetic marks, CD3Z and VHL hypermethylation, were significantly correlated with SLE: CD3Z hypermethylation (odds ratio = 7.76; P = 1.71 x 10 -13 ) and VHL hypermethylation (odds ratio = 3.77; P = 3.20 x 10 -8 ), and the increased CD3Z methylation was correlated with downregulation of the CD3zeta-chain in SLE T cells. In addition, less genetic influence on CD3Z methylation relative to VHL methylation was found in analyses of longitudinal and twin samples. Furthermore, a higher CD3Z methylation level was significantly correlated with a higher SLE disease activity index and more severe clinical manifestations, such as proteinuria, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, whereas VHL hypermethylation was not.Conclusion.: CD3Z hypermethylation is an SLE risk factor that can be modified by environmental factors and is associated with more severe SLE clinical manifestations, which are related to deranged T cell function by downregulating the CD3zeta-chain.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to systematically investigate the clinical features, diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome in order to improve understanding of this disease. A total of 3 cases of VHL syndrome treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College (Zunyi, China) between September 2014 and October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The associated literature was reviewed, and the diagnostic and therapeutic features were discussed. Case 1 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by a renal tumor on the right side, and radical tumor resection in the right kidney was performed. Postoperative pathological examination indicated clear cell carcinoma. Case 2 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma. The left-side adrenal tumor was removed, and postoperative pathological analysis was suggestive of adrenal pheochromocytoma. Case 3 visited the hospital due to the presence of masses on the left and right sides of the kidney, but did not undergo surgery for personal reasons. Follow-ups were scheduled subsequent to surgery at another hospital. The diagnosis in all 3 cases was confirmed by genetic testing, where VHL mutations were detected in all patients. Following surgery, pedigree and genetic analysis was performed in all 3 pedigrees and VHL mutations were identified in 7 family members. The diagnosis of VHL syndrome should be based on the clinical manifestation of the patients and the results of genetic tests. DNA analysis of mutations is the main method for diagnosis. An appropriate surgical plan should be formulated based on the site, size and number of tumors, and the condition of the patient. Since VHL syndrome is an inheritable genetic disorder and relapse following surgery is common, pedigree analysis of the patient and lifelong follow-ups are essential. Additionally, physicians should pay attention to VHL syndrome in order to avoid missing diagnosis or misdiagnosis.

N2  - Introduction: Although few studies have demonstrated utility of <sup>18</sup>F- fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computerised tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT) in benign pheochromocytoma/paragangliomas (PCC/PGLs), there limited data on factors predicting the FDG uptake in PCC/PGL. Methods: The study was conducted at a tertiary health care centre. In addition to the routine investigations, all patients (n = 96) with PCC/PGL were evaluated with <sup>18</sup>F-FDGPET/CT and majority (n = 78) underwent <sup>131</sup>I-metaiodobenzyl guanidine (<sup>131</sup>I-MIBG) scintigraphy. Forty-three patients also underwent testing for germline mutations in five PCC/PGL susceptibility genes (VHL, RET, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD) and all patients were evaluated clinically for neurofibromatosis-1. Results: The study included 96 patients with PCC/PGL(82 benign and 14 malignant). FDGSUVmax was significantly higher for malignant than benign PCC/PGL(P = 0.009) and for extra-adrenal PGL than adrenal PCC (P = 0.017). In subgroup analysis, metanephrine-secreting PCC and non-secretory PCC had significantly lower FDG SUVmax than normetanephrine-secreting PCC (P = 0.017, P = 0.038 respectively), normetanephrine-secreting-sympathetic PGL (P = 0.008, P = 0.019 respectively) and non-secretory sympathetic PGL (P = 0.003, P = 0.009 respectively). Patients with mutations in cluster 1 genes (n = 14) had significantly higher FDG SUVmax than those with mutations in cluster 2 genes (n = 4) (P = 0.04). Sensitivities of <sup>131</sup>I-MIBG and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CTwere 77.78% and 100% for cluster 1 genes-related PCC/PGL whereas they were 100% and 50% for cluster 2 genes-related PCC/PGL, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis of mutation positive patients identified genetic status as the only independent predictor of FDG SUVmax. Conclusion: The study suggests that the underlying genetic status determines FDG uptake in PCC/PGL and not location, secretory status or malignancy.

N2  - Manipulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to achieve targeted degradation of proteins within cells using chemical tools and drugs has the potential to transform pharmacological and therapeutic approaches in cancer and other diseases. An increased understanding of the molecular mechanism of thalidomide and its analogues following their clinical use has unlocked small-molecule modulation of the substrate specificity of the E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN), which in turn has resulted in the advancement of new immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) into the clinic. The degradation of multiple context-specific proteins by these pleiotropic small molecules provides a means to uncover new cell biology and to generate future drug molecules against currently undruggable targets. In parallel, the development of larger bifunctional molecules that bring together highly specific protein targets in complexes with CRBN, von Hippel-Lindau, or other E3 ligases to promote ubiquitin-dependent degradation has progressed to generate selective chemical compounds with potent effects in cells and in vivo models, providing valuable tools for biological target validation and with future potential for therapeutic use. In this review, we survey recent breakthroughs achieved in these two complementary methods and the discovery of new modes of direct and indirect engagement of target proteins with the proteasome. We discuss the experimental characterisation that validates the use of molecules that promote protein degradation as chemical tools, the preclinical and clinical examples disclosed to date, and the future prospects for this exciting area of chemical biology.

N2  - Numerous studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, are determining regulatory elements involved in the pathogenesis of various types of cancer, including cervical cancer (CC). Although miR-21-5p upregulation has been demonstrated to associate with tumorigenesis by controlling the expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes, only a small number of studies have investigated the expression of miR-21-5p and its functional role in CC. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of miR-21-5p on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of CC cells, and the potential underlying molecular mechanism of these effects. The measurement of miR-21-5p levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that miR-21-5p was markedly increased in CC cell lines compared with normal cells. Upon silencing of miR-21-5p, a marked suppression of the proliferation, migration and invasion of CaSki cells was observed, with induction of cell apoptosis. These effects were reversed with miR-21-5p overexpression. A database search followed by a luciferase reporter assay ascertained that the 3'-untranslated region of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mRNA sequence was a direct target of miR-21-5p. Furthermore, silencing of VHL neutralized the effects of miR-21-5p inhibition. These observations suggested that miR-21-5p is an oncogene that is able to promote the metastatic phenotype of CC cells through downregulation of VHL expression, which may present a path to novel therapeutic stratagems for the CC therapy.

N2  - Hypoxia promotes tumour aggressiveness and reduces patient survival. A spectrum of poor outcome among patients with hypoxic tumours suggests that additional factors modulate how tumours respond to hypoxia. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with a pivotal role in genomic stability and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We reported that cancer type-specific piRNA signatures vary among patients. However, remarkably homogenous piRNA profiles are detected across patients with renal cell carcinoma, a cancer characterized by constitutive upregulation of hypoxia-related signaling induced by common mutation or loss of von Hippel-Lindau factor (VHL). By investigating >3000 piRNA transcriptomes in hypoxic and non-hypoxic tumors from seven organs, we discovered 40 hypoxia-regulated piRNAs and validated this in cells cultured under hypoxia. Moreover, a subset of these hypoxia-regulated piRNAs are regulated by VHL/HIF signaling in vitro. A hypoxia-regulated piRNA-based score (PiSco) was associated with poor RFS for hypoxic tumours, particularly Stage I lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting that hypoxia-regulated piRNA expression can predict tumour recurrence even in early-stage tumours and thus may be of clinical utility.

N2  - The purpose of this article is to review the hereditary renal cystic diseases that can manifest in children and adults, with specific attention to pathogenesis and imaging features. Various common and uncommon hereditary renal cystic diseases are reviewed in terms of their underlying etiology, including the involved genetic mutations and the affected proteins and cellular structures. Focus is placed on the morphologic findings in each condition and the features that distinguish one disorder from another. The two most common categories of hereditary renal cystic disease are (a) the ciliopathic disorders, which are related to mutations affecting the primary cilia (called "ciliopathies"), and (b) the phakomatoses. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, and the "medullary cystic disease complex" are all ciliopathies but have different phenotypes. Tuberous sclerosis complex and the associated "contiguous gene syndrome," as well as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, are phakomatoses that can manifest with cystic renal lesions but have uniquely different extrarenal manifestations. Finally, DICER1 mutations can manifest with renal cystic lesions (typically, cystic nephromas) in patients predisposed to other malignancies in the chest, ovaries, and thyroid. Although some overlap exists in the appearance of the renal cysts associated with each of these diseases, there are clear morphologic differences (eg, cyst size, location, and complexity) that are emphasized in this review. To improve patient outcomes, it is important for the radiologist to recognize the various hereditary renal cystic diseases so that a correct diagnosis is assigned and so that the patient is adequately evaluated and followed up. <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2017.

N2  - Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, arising from neuroendocrine cells that are dispersed throughout the body. Around 20% of NETs occur in the context of a genetic syndrome. Today there are at least ten recognized NET syndromes. This includes the classical syndromes: multiple endocrine neoplasias types 1 and 2, and von Hippel-Lindau and neurofibromatosis type 1. Additional susceptibility genes associated with a smaller fraction of NETs have also been identified. Recognizing genetic susceptibility has proved essential both to provide genetic counseling and to give the best preventive care. In this review we will also discuss the knowledge of somatic genetic alterations in NETs. At least 24 genes have been implicated as drivers of neuroendocrine tumorigenesis, and the overall rates of genomic instability are relatively low. Genetic intra-tumoral, as well as inter-tumoral heterogeneity in the same patient, have also been identified. Together these data point towards the common pathways in NET evolution, separating early from late disease drivers. Although knowledge of specific mutations in NETs has limited impact on actual patient management, we predict that in the near future genomic profiling of tumors will be included in the clinical arsenal for diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutic decisions.

N2  - Renal cancer accounts for 2.4% of all cancers. Localised disease accounts for the majority of renal cancers (70-75%), however 20-25% of these ultimately develop distant metastasis. The median overall survival of un treated metastatic disease is 5 months with 1-year survival of only 29%. The management of metastatic renal cell cancers traditionally relied on systemic immunotherapy with attendant high morbidity but after the year 2005 the use of effective targeted therapy with tolerable side effect profile has improved the survival from 10.2 months in the cytokine era to 17.7 months. This article reviews the past, present and future options in the management of metastatic renal cancer. © 2017 Copyright S.G.D. Gangadaran.

N2  - Dormant cancer cells are deprivation-resistant, and cause a number of problems for therapeutic approaches for cancers. Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) include deprivation-resistant cells that are resistant to various treatments. In this study, the specific characteristics of deprivation-resistant cells were transcriptionally identified by next generation sequencing. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) transcription factor network was significantly enhanced in deprivation-resistant RCCs compared to the sensitive RCCs. Deprivation-resistant RCCs, that had lost Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor expression, expressed hydroxyl-HIF2-alpha in the nucleus, but not sensitive-RCCs. Hydroxyl-HIF-alpha was also expressed in nuclei of RCC tissue samples. Knockdown for HIF2-alpha, but not HIF1-alpha, induced cell death related to a reduction in HIF-related gene expression in deprivation-resistant RCC cells. Chetomin, a nuclear HIF-inhibitor, induced marked level of cytotoxicity in deprivation-resistant cells, similar to the knockdown of HIF2-alpha. Therefore, hydroxyl-HIF2-alpha might be a potential therapeutic target for RCCs.

N2  - Mutations in von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) predispose to develop tumors affecting specific target organs, such as the retina, epididymis, adrenal glands, pancreas and kidneys. Currently, more than 400pVHL interacting proteins are either described in the literature or predicted in public databases. This data is scattered among several different sources, slowing down the comprehension of pVHL's biological role. Here we present VHLdb, a novel database collecting available interaction and mutation data on pVHL to provide novel integrated annotations. In VHLdb, pVHL interactors are organized according to two annotation levels, manual and automatic. Mutation data are easily accessible and a novel visualization tool has been implemented. A user-friendly feedback function to improve database content through community-driven curation is also provided. VHLdb presently contains 478 interactors, of which 117 have been manually curated, and 1,074 mutations. This makes it the largest available database for pVHL-related information. VHLdb is available from URL: http://vhldb.bio.unipd.it/.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas (PCC) and paragangliomas (PGL) are tumours occurring in the adrenal medulla and in extra-adrenal paraganglia, respectively. They have long been associated with familial occurrence and several syndromes had been described in which PCC formed an important component, including multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau disease and neurofibromatosis type 1. Since the beginning of this millennium, both by the elucidation of specific genes, such as the various succinate dehydrogenase genes, as well as by generic molecular biology approaches, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) initiative, it was shown that the frequency of germline mutations in candidate genes for PCC and PGL has increased to 35-40%. In addition, somatic mutations have been shown to be much more frequent than previously thought, such that now 60-65% of these tumours harbour either a germline or a somatic mutation. This review gives an overview of the various syndromes and the genes involved, concluding with recommendations for genetic testing in the current era of genome wide analysis. Copyright © 2017

N2  - Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare, neural crest-originating, neuroendocrine tumors. HuR is an mRNA-binding protein of the ELAV/Hu-protein family, which participates in posttranscriptional regulation of many cancer-associated genes. HuR expression has been connected with aggressive behavior of several malignancies. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is also expressed in several malignant tumors, and its expression is regulated by HuR. Tissue microarray of 153 primary pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas was investigated for the expression of HuR and COX-2 proteins by immunohistochemistry using two different HuR antibodies (HuR19F12 and HuR3A). In these tumors, the expression of both intranuclear and cytoplasmic HuR was detectable. Increased cytoplasmic HuR expression was significantly associated with metastatic tumors. Increased COX-2 and MIB-1 expression also was associated with metastatic potential, and moreover, HuR and COX-2 expression correlated with each other. Our data suggest that increased expression of HuR protein is associated with metastatic potential of paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, and COX-2 seems to be a target of HuR.

N2  - Ganglioneuromas represent the most well-differentiated spectrum of neoplasia arising from the sympathetic nervous system, while neuroblastomas represent the most poorly differentiated counterpart, and ganglioneuroblastomas represent intermediate stages of differentiation. Small series of cases have documented the co-occurrence of ganglioneuroma with a pheochromocytoma (Pheo)/paraganglioma (PGL) component. We report the clinicopathologic features of eight such cases, diagnosed between 2003 and 2015 with a mean follow-up of 22 months (1-47), which were evaluated for syndrome associations, SDHB expression, and clinical outcome. Mutations of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex subunits (A, B, C, D, and SDHAF2) have been implicated in predicting metastatic behavior and in identifying possible paraganglioma syndromes. The proliferative index was calculated by manual quantification of Ki-67-positive cells at selected hot-spots using ImageJ (NIH). In our series, composite Pheo/PGL-ganglioneuromas predominantly involved the adrenal gland (Pheo 7, PGL 1). The cases had an equal gender distribution (males 4, females 4), with a mean age at diagnosis of 67 years (range 53 to 86 years), an average size of 5.2 cm (range 2 to 8.2 cm), an average weight of 49.3 g (7.8 to 144.7 g, n = 6), and the majority were functionally active (7 of 8, 88%). The mean Ki67 proliferation rate was 2% (range 0.3 to 3%), and all cases retained SDHB expression (8/8, 100%). No patient (0/8, 0%) developed metastatic disease on follow-up. One patient had a retroperitoneal composite PGL-ganglioneuroma in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1. No recurrent disease or other associations were identified. In our study, composite Pheo/PGL-ganglioneuromas predominantly affected the adrenal gland in older patients, showed no loss of SDHB, and no disease recurrence was identified.

N2  - Background and Aims The value of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of pancreatic cyst fluid relative to the clinical and imaging impression has not been well-studied. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of NGS on the clinical diagnosis from imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and thus the management of pancreatic cysts. Methods Ninety-two pancreatic cyst fluids from 86 patients were analyzed by cytology, CEA, and targeted NGS. Cysts were classified by imaging as nonmucinous, mucinous, or not specified. NGS results were compared with the imaging impression stratified by CEA and cytology. Results NGS impacted the clinical diagnosis by defining a cyst as mucinous in 48% of cysts without elevated CEA levels. The VHL gene in 2 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) supported a serous cystadenoma. Twenty percent of cysts that were nonmucinous by imaging were mucinous by NGS. Of the 14 not-specific cysts, CEA levels were not elevated in 12 (86%), and NGS established a mucinous etiology in 3 (25%). A KRAS or GNAS mutation supported an IPMN with nonmucinous CEA in 71%. A KRAS mutation reclassified 19% of nonneoplastic cysts with nonmucinous CEA as mucinous. Seven cyst fluids (8%) had either a TP53 mutation or loss of CDKN2A or SMAD4 in addition to KRAS and/or GNAS mutations; 5 of 7 (71%) were clinically malignant, and high-grade cytology was detected in all 5. Overall, CEA was more specific for a mucinous etiology (100%), but NGS was more sensitive (86% vs 57%). Conclusions NGS of pancreatic cyst fluid impacts clinical diagnosis and patient management by defining, supporting, or changing the clinical diagnosis based on imaging and CEA. NGS was most valuable in identifying mucinous cysts with nonmucinous CEA. An added benefit is the potential to detect mutations late in the progression to malignancy that may increase the risk classification of the cyst based on imaging and cytology.

N2  - Complex insertions and deletions (indels) are formed by simultaneously deleting and inserting DNA fragments of different sizes at a common genomic location. Here we present a systematic analysis of somatic complex indels in the coding sequences of samples from over 8,000 cancer cases using Pindel-C. We discovered 285 complex indels in cancer-associated genes (such as PIK3R1, TP53, ARID1A, GATA3 and KMT2D) in approximately 3.5% of cases analyzed; nearly all instances of complex indels were overlooked (81.1%) or misannotated (17.6%) in previous reports of 2,199 samples. In-frame complex indels are enriched in PIK3R1 and EGFR, whereas frameshifts are prevalent in VHL, GATA3, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN and ATRX. Furthermore, complex indels display strong tissue specificity (such as VHL in kidney cancer samples and GATA3 in breast cancer samples). Finally, structural analyses support findings of previously missed, but potentially druggable, mutations in the EGFR, MET and KIT oncogenes. This study indicates the critical importance of improving complex indel discovery and interpretation in medical research.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome occurring in one out of 36,000 live births. Diagnosis could be a challenge in patients with no familial VHL history. Renal cancer (RCC) represents one of the most important manifestations. RCC is usually recurrent and multifocal. Actually treating RCC in VHL patients represent a clinical dilemma: the oncological outcomes must be balanced against renal function preservation.CASE PRESENTATION: A young man with a negative familial history was referred to our department with seven misdiagnosed renal masses. VHL disease was determined through genetic test. The multiple RCCs were treated by surgery and percutaneous thermal ablation by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with complete control of RCC and no impairment of renal function.CONCLUSIONS: This case history confirms that VHL disease has to be suspected in young patients with evidence of synchronous multiple renal masses and in presence of specific clinical criteria.RFA appears to be safe in terms of oncological radicalism and in renal function preservation.In hereditary RCC, we should purpose, whenever it is possible, minimally invasive treatment in terms of low hospital stay and a minimal loss of renal tissue.

N2  - Cancer development is presumed to be an evolutionary process that is influenced by genetic background and environment. In laboratory animals, genetics and environment are variables that can largely be held constant. In humans, it is possible to compare independent tumours that have developed in the same patient, effectively constraining genetic and environmental variation and leaving only stochastic processes. Patients affected with von Hippel-Lindau disease are at risk of developing multiple independent clear cell renal carcinomas. Here we perform whole-genome sequencing on 40 tumours from six von Hippel-Lindau patients. We confirm that the tumours are clonally independent, having distinct somatic single-nucleotide variants. Although tumours from the same patient show many differences, within-patient patterns are discernible. Single-nucleotide substitution type rates are significantly different between patients and show biases in trinucleotide mutation context. We also observe biases in chromosome copy number aberrations. These results show that genetic background and/or environment can influence the types of mutations that occur.

N2  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence is highest in highly developed countries and it is the seventh most common neoplasm diagnosed. RCC management include nephrectomy and targeted therapies. Type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) pathway plays an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance. IGF-1 and insulin share overlapping downstream signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells. IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) stimulation may promote malignant transformation promoting cell proliferation, dedifferentiation and inhibiting apoptosis. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients with IGF1R overexpression have 70 % increased risk of death compared to patients who had tumors without IGF1R expression. IGF1R signaling deregulation may results in p53, WT, BRCA1, VHL loss of function. RCC cells with high expression of IGF1R are more resistant to chemotherapy than cells with low expression. Silencing of IGF1R increase the chemosensitivity of ccRCC cells and the effect is greater in VHL mutated cells. Understanding the role of IGF-1 signaling pathway in RCC may result in development of new targeted therapeutic interventions. First preclinical attempts with anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies or fragment antigen-binding (Fab) fragments alone or in combination with an mTOR inhibitor were shown to inhibit in vitro growth and reduced the number of colonies formed by of RCC cells.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Extra-adrenal paragangliomas (PGLs) are infrequent, benign, and neuroendocrine tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the autonomic nervous system. Most PGLs are sporadic, but up to 32% are associated with inherited syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type 1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and familial PGL. Although most PGLs develop above the umbilicus, they have been reported in the genitourinary (GU) tract. Owing to the paucity of literature on the rates of GU PGL, the objective of our study is to describe the demographic, pathologic, and clinical characteristics of GU PGL, and compare them to non-GU sites of PGL using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database.METHODS: The SEER 18 database was used to identify all cases of PGL from 2000 to 2012. Demographic, pathologic, and clinical characteristics were described using chi-square and t-test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare overall survival (OS) between GU and non-GU PGL. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. All analyses were performed using excel and SAS/Stat version 9.4.RESULTS: A total of 299 cases of PGL were retrieved from SEER, and 20 (6.7%) of the total PGL arose from the GU tract. The mean age at diagnosis was higher in non-GU than GU PGL (50.4+/-17.2 vs. 40.8+/-15.6, P = 0.026). Furthermore, 75% of GU PGLs developed in the bladder, followed by the kidneys/renal pelvis, and spermatic cord (20%). Non-GU PGL developed most frequently within the endocrine system (43%). PGL, overall, was more common in men than in women, and it was more common in whites than all other races. Although 55.5% of GU PGLs were organ confined, only 22.2% of non-GU PGLs were localized at diagnosis. All cases of PGL were treated with surgery. There were 2 cause-specific deaths in the GU PGL groups between 2000 and 2012. The 5-year OS was 93.3% for GU PGL vs. 65.5% in non-GU PGL (P = 0.062).CONCLUSIONS: GU PGL remains rare with low incidence (6.7% of all PGL cases) in the US population between 2000 and 2012. Bladder PGL represents just 5% of all PGL. Moreover, GU PGL had better OS compared to PGL developing outside of the GU tract although the P-value only approached statistical significance. The bladder represents the most common site of involvement, and surgery is the mainstay of treatment for GU PGL. Clearer prognostic factors, including tumor grade and stage, are needed to better elucidate PGL management in the future; thus, pooled studies from various institutions with detailed clinical information are needed to delineate these prognostic factors.

N2  - Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a significant risk of colorectal and endometrial cancers. A variety of other epithelial cancers may be associated with this syndrome. Brian tumors are infrequent, but have been reported in series. Here, we report a case of a 34-year-old Caucasian woman with WHO grade III choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC). Comprehensive genomic profiling of the patient's resected brain tumor revealed mutations in six genes: PTEN, VHL, MSH6, NOTCH1, RB1, and TP53. Family history is significant for endometrial cancer in her mother and sister as well as colon cancer in her maternal grandfather suggestive of Lynch syndrome. Site-specific mutational analysis showed the MSH6 mutation (p.R482*) in peripheral lymphocytes. Subsequently we performed immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissue which demonstrated widespread loss of MSH6 with intact MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome due to a mutation in MSH6 was therefore established. Our patient elected to have adjuvant radiation to the surgical bed only followed by prophylactic total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and is doing very well. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of CPC in an adult patient with a germline MSH6 mutation. We believe our data have provided molecular evidence to suggest that CPC could potentially be part of the Lynch syndrome spectrum. Copyright © 2017

    references other cases in literature with women with HB (about 40 other papers)
N2  - Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are benign, highly vascular tumors, often characterized by loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) gene. They are the most common central nervous system tumor observed in vHL syndrome. Loss of function of the vHL gene creates a "pseudo-hypoxic" state, causing overactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related pathways. In some cases, HBs can rapidly increase in size during pregnancy to then present acutely, which most frequently occurs after the 20th gestational week. These changes in size usually occur from enlargement of the cystic component of the HB. Due to their preferred location in the posterior fossa near critical structures as well as along the spinal cord, such cases can present with severe neurological deficits, requiring urgent surgical intervention in a multidisciplinary setting. However, the reasons for this acute flare-up during pregnancy remain poorly understood, as are the reasons why this occurs in only a subset of tumors. Unveiling the etiology for this clinical scenario can affect the treatment of HBs, as it will contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of such a transformation from a quiescent lesion to a symptomatic one, not only in the setting of pregnancy. Identifying the correct triggers and the conditions initiating and mediating this switch will enable us to develop preventive medications which should allow us to keep the tumor in its quiescent phase. In this pathophysiological review, we investigate the association between HB growth and pregnancy based on an analysis > 40 such published cases. We suggest that the proangiogenic state of pregnancy is the leading etiology for this striking association, and to support the argument, we discuss its potential impact on HIF overexpression in a non-hypoxic manner through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by proangiogenic factors. Specifically, we discuss the involvement of placental growth factor (PlGF) and its receptor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) in various pathologic processes that can lead to the formation and growth of peritumoral edema and cysts, which are the primary causes for the development of any symptoms in HB. Both PlGF and VEGFR-1 are expressed at increased levels during pregnancy, and both have been reported as part of various pathological processes, including angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. The unique feature that both do essentially not show any significant negative impact on regular physiological processes makes them attractive therapeutic targets since very little side effects are expected. Further research into the effects of anti-PlGF or anti-VEGFR-1 therapy in HB is therefore recommended.

N2  - AIMS: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. As tumors that develop in the context of VHL also occur in a sporadic context, the frequency of this syndrome may be underestimated. Our aim was to identify VHL gene mutations in Argentinian patients who fulfilled the clinical criteria for type 1 VHL disease and in patients with VHL-associated manifestations that did not meet these criteria.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study, including patients who met current diagnostic criteria for type 1 VHL (Group 1, n=19) and patients with VHL-associated manifestations that did not meet these criteria (Group 2, n=21). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Mutation analysis involved DNA sequencing, while large deletions were determined by universal primer quantitative fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction (UPQFM-PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis.RESULTS: VHL mutations were detected in 16/19 (84.2%) patients in Group 1 and included: gross deletions (4/16); nonsense mutations (6/16); frameshift mutations (4/16); missense mutations (1/16); and splicing mutations (1/16). Three of these mutations were novel. No alterations were found in 3 of 19 VHL patients. In Group 2, one nonsense VHL mutation was detected in a young patient with a solitary central nervous system hemangioblastoma without familial history. A study of 30 first-degree relatives revealed four carriers with VHL mutations.CONCLUSIONS: We found three novel mutations in the VHL gene in our population. Our results emphasize the importance of a complete genetic study of VHL to confirm type 1 VHL disease, not only in patients with clinical diagnostic criteria but also in those presenting a single typical manifestation.

N2  - Background Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome characterized by development of a variety of benign and malignant tumors in multiple organ systems. Frequency of pancreatic involvement in VHL varies from 17 to 56% and majority of these tumors are benign. Clinical Case This is a 32 year-old Thai male with VHL diagnosed at age 20 when he was found to have a cerebellar hemangioblastoma. Genetic testing revealed a large deletion of exon 3 and poly A sites of VHL gene. Abdominal CT obtained as part of routine surveillance demonstrated multiple cystic lesions with rim enhancement in the pancreas. Based on CT characteristics, these lesions were presumed benign thus regular follow-up abdominal imagings were not performed. 10 years later, he developed abdominal discomfort. CT abdomen showed multiple solid and cystic enhancing lesions involving the entire pancreas with a hypervascular mass at segment 7 of liver. Given radiological findings, he was diagnosed with malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) with liver metastasis, thereupon underwent total pancreactomy with wedge resection of the liver mass. Surprisingly, the histopathology revealed a serous cystadenocarcinoma in the pancreas measuring 28 x 11.5 x 7 cm and a 4.5 x 4.5 x 3 cm metastatic lesion in the liver with hepatic capsular invasion. Since then annual abdominal CTs have been performed. Until present, there has been no evidence of tumor recurrence. Clinical lessons Pancreatic involvement in VHL includes simple cyst, serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) and pancreatic NET. Simple cysts are the most common lesions (47%), followed by PNETs (15%), and serous cystadenomas (11%). Majority of pancreatic lesions in VHL are benign. Malignant cases have been observed in 10% of PNETs. Malignant SCNs accounts for up to 3% of all SCNs. According to WHO classification, VHL associated SCNs is one of the 4 variants of SCNs. All of VHL associated SCNs are virtually benign. To our knowledge, our case is the first and largest malignant SCNs being reported in VHL patient. The pitfall in our case is that serial abdominal exams were not performed in the first 10 years after diagnosis of VHL as the initial CT findings suggested benign cystic lesions. Clinicians should be aware of potential malignant transformation of benign SCNs and regular follow up should be implemented especially in patients with VHL. In addition, it should be noted that imaging diagnosis is not sufficient to distinguish purely benign cysts and potentially malignant cystic lesions of the pancreas and histologic confirmation is required however surgical resection is reserved only if there is a high suspicion for malignancy. Conclusion Although almost all pancreatic lesions in VHL are benign, one should be aware of potential malignant transformation of benign appearing lesions on imaging studies. Annual abdominal imaging surveillance is recommended beginning at age 16.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Genetic intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) hinders biomarker development in metastatic clear cell renal cancer (mccRCC). Epigenetic relative to genetic ITH or the presence of consistent epigenetic changes following targeted therapy in mccRCC have not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine methylome/genetic ITH and to evaluate specific epigenetic and genetic changes associated with sunitinib therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multi-region DNA sampling performed on sequential frozen pairs of primary tumor tissue from 14 metastatic ccRCC patients, in the Upfront Sunitinib (SU011248) Therapy Followed by Surgery in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cancer: a Pilot Phase II Study (SuMR; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01024205), at presentation (biopsy) and after 3-cycles of 50mg sunitinib (nephrectomy). Untreated biopsy and nephrectomy samples before and after renal artery ligation were controls. Ion Proton sequencing of 48 key ccRCC genes, and MethylCap-seq DNA methylation analysis was performed, data was analysed using the statistical computing environment R.RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed complete methylome clustering of biopsy and three nephrectomy samples for each patient (14/14 patients). For mutational status, untreated biopsy and all treated nephrectomy samples clustered together in 8/13 (61.5%) patients. The only methylation target significantly altered following sunitinib therapy was VHL promoter region 7896829 which was hypermethylated with treatment (FDR=0.077, P<0.001) and consistent for all patients (pre-treatment 50% patients had VHL mutations, 14% patients VHL hypermethylation). Renal artery ligation did not affect this result. No significant differences in driver or private mutation count was found with sunitinib treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Demonstration of relative methylome homogeneity and consistent VHL hypermethylation, after sunitinib, may overcome the hurdle of ITH present at other molecular levels for biomarker research.

N2  - Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPRCC) is a recently recognised neoplasm with a broad spectrum of morphological characteristics, thus representing a challenging differential diagnosis, especially with the low malignant potential multicystic renal cell neoplasms and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We selected 14 cases of CCPRCC with a wide spectrum of morphological features diagnosed on morphology and CK7 immunoreactivity and analysed them using a panel of immunohistochemical markers, focusing on 34betaE12 and related CKs 1,5,10 and 14 and several molecular analyses such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH), VHL methylation, VHL and TCEB1 sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Twelve of 13 (92%) CCPRCC tumours were positive for 34betaE12. One tumour without 3p alteration by FISH revealed VHL mutation and 3p deletion at aCGH; thus, it was re-classified as clear cell RCC. We concluded that: (1) immunohistochemical expression of CK7 is necessary for diagnostic purposes, but may not be sufficient to identify CCPRCC, while 34betaE12, in part due to the presence of CK14 antigen expression, can be extremely useful for the recognition of this tumour; and (2) further molecular analysis of chromosome 3p should be considered to support of CCPRCC diagnosis, when FISH analysis does not evidence the common loss of chromosome 3p.

N2  - Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is nearly incurable and accounts for most of the mortality associated with RCC. Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) is a tumour suppressor that is lost in the majority of clear cell RCC (ccRCC) cases. Its role in regulating hypoxia-inducible factors-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and -2alpha (HIF-2alpha) is well-studied. Recent work has demonstrated that VHL knock down induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. In this study we showed that a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock out of VHL in the RENCA model leads to morphologic and molecular changes indicative of EMT, which in turn drives increased metastasis to the lungs. RENCA cells deficient in HIF-1alpha failed to undergo EMT changes upon VHL knockout. RNA-seq revealed several HIF-1alpha-regulated genes that are upregulated in our VHL knockout cells and whose overexpression signifies an aggressive form of ccRCC in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database. Independent validation in a new clinical dataset confirms the upregulation of these genes in ccRCC samples compared to adjacent normal tissue. Our findings indicate that loss of VHL could be driving tumour cell dissemination through stabilization of HIF-1alpha in RCC. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon can guide the search for more effective treatments to combat mRCC.

    92 families test positive for germline VHL mutation; supplementary tables for data extraction not found
N2  - Since the 1980s the genetic cause of many hereditary tumor syndromes has been elucidated. As a consequence, carriers of a deleterious mutation in these genes may opt for prenatal diagnoses (PND). We studied the uptake of prenatal diagnosis for five hereditary cancer syndromes in the Netherlands. Uptake for retinoblastoma (Rb) was compared with uptake for Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and hereditary breast ovarian cancer (HBOC). A questionnaire was completed by all nine DNA-diagnostic laboratories assessing the number of independent mutation-positive families identified from the start of diagnostic testing until May 2013, and the number of PNDs performed for these syndromes within these families. Of 187 families with a known Rb-gene mutation, 22 had performed PND (11.8%), this was significantly higher than uptake for FAP (1.6%) and HBOC (<0.2%). For VHL (6.5%) and LFS (4.9%) the difference was not statistically significant. PND for Rb started 3 years after introduction of diagnostic DNA testing and remained stable over the years. For the other cancer syndromes PND started 10-15 years after the introduction and uptake for PND showed an increase after 2009. We conclude that uptake of PND for Rb was significantly higher than for FAP and HBOC, but not different from VHL and LFS. Early onset, high penetrance, lack of preventive surgery and perceived burden of disease may explain these differences.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare hereditary cancer syndrome with poor survival. Although the genotype-phenotype correlation has been described previously, little is known about the relationship between alteration in VHL protein (pVHL) and phenotypic diversity. Materials & Methods: We recruited 339 VHL patients from 128 unrelated families. VHL gene mutations were divided into 3 groups: missed mutation located in HIF-alpha binding site (HM group), non-HIF-alpha binding site (nHM group), and truncating mutation (TR group). Kaplan-Meier curve was used to describe the survival and age-related penetrance in different groups. Cox regression model was performed to evaluate age-related risks for VHL-associated tumors. Results: Patients with missense mutations conferred an increased risk of pheochromocytoma (HR=1.854, p=0.047) than those with truncating mutations. Stratifying missense mutations into nHM and HM showed that the risk for pheochromocytoma was lower in HM group than in nHM group (HR=0.298, p=0.003), but was similar between HM and TR group (HR=0.901, P=0.810). After putting HM and TR into one group (HMTR group), patients in nHM group had higher risk for pheochromocytoma (HR=3.134, p<0.001) and lower risks for central nervous system hemangioblastoma (HR=0.685, p=0.034), renal cell carcinoma (HR=0.639, p=0.036) and pancreatic tumor (HR=0.468, p=0.001) than those in HMTR group. Moreover, nHM group was independently related to a better overall survival (HR=0.345, p=0.005) and CHB-specific survival (HR=0.129, p=0.005) than HMTR group. Conclusions: The new genotype-phenotype correlation links VHL gene mutation, substrate (HIF-alpha) binding site in pVHL, and phenotypic diversity (penetrance and survival), and provides more accurate information for genetic consultation and pathogenesis study.

N2  - The KCL017 human embryonic stem cell line was derived from an embryo donated for research that carried an autosomal dominant mutation affecting splicing site of the VHL gene encoding von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (676+3A>T). The ICM was isolated using laser microsurgery and plated on gamma-irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. Both the derivation and cell line propagation were performed in an animal product-free environment. Pluripotent state and differentiation potential were confirmed by in vitro assays.

N2  - Hemangioblastoma (HB) is mainly located in the brain and the spinal cord. The tumor is composed of two major components, namely neoplastic stromal cells and abundant microvessels. Thus, hyper-vascularization is the hallmark of this tumor. Despite the identification of germline and/or epigenetic mutations of Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene as an important pathogenic mechanism of HB, little is known about the molecular signaling involved in this highly vascularized tumor. The present study investigated the key players of multiple angiogenic signaling pathways including VEGF/VEGFR2, EphB4/EphrinB2, SDF1alpha/CXCR4 and Notch/Dll4 pathways in surgical specimens of 22 HB. The expression of key angiogenic factors was detected by RT<sup>2</sup> -PCR and Western blot. Immunofluorescent staining revealed the cellular localization of these proteins. We demonstrated a massive upregulation of mRNA levels of VEGF and VEGFR2, CXCR4 and SDF1alpha, EphB4 and EphrinB2, as well as the main components of Dll4-Notch signaling in HB. An increase in the protein expression of VEGF, CXCR4 and the core-components of Dll4-Notch signaling was associated with an activation of Akt and Erk1/2 and accompanied by an elevated expression of PCNA. Immuofluorescent staining revealed the expression of VEGF and CXCR4 in endothelial cells as well as in tumor cells. Dll4 protein was predominantly found in tumor cells, whereas EphB4 immunoreactivity was exclusively detected in endothelial cells. We conclude that multiple key angiogenic pathways were activated in HB, which may synergistically contribute to the abundant vascularization in this tumor. Identification of these aberrant pathways provides potential targets for a possible future application of anti-angiogenic therapy for this tumor, particularly when a total surgical resection becomes difficult due to the localization or multiplicity of the tumor.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a central role in the transcriptional response to changes in oxygen availability. Stability of HIFs is regulated by multi-step reactions including recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (pVHL) in association with an E3 ligase complex. Here we show that pVHL physically interacts with fatty acid synthase (FASN), displacing the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This results in HIF-alpha protein stabilization and activation of HIF target genes even in normoxia such as during adipocyte differentiation. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), an inhibitor of FASN expression, also inhibited HIF target gene expression in cultured cells and in mouse liver. Clinically, FASN is frequently upregulated in a broad variety of cancers and has been reported to have an oncogenic function. We found that upregulation of FASN correlated with induction of many HIF target genes, notably in a malignant subtype of prostate tumours. Therefore, pVHL-FASN interaction plays a regulatory role for HIFs and their target gene expression.

N2  - Hereditary renal cancers account for approximately 5%-8% of all renal tumors. Over the past 2 decades, a number of syndromes have been identified that predispose patients to early renal cancer development, representing all the major histologic types of tumor pathology. In this article, we describe the current knowledge concerning the cell type, known mechanism of tumor development, other manifestations of the syndrome, imaging findings, genetic screening, and imaging surveillance recommendations for each of the major syndromes associated with hereditary renal cancers.

N2  - Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are uncommon tumors characterized by the presence of inactivating alterations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene in inherited cases and by infrequent somatic mutation in sporadic entities. We performed whole exome sequencing on 11 HB patients to further elucidate the genetics of HBs. A total of 270 somatic variations in 219 genes, of which there were 86 mutations in 67 genes, were found in sporadic HBs, and 184 mutations were found in 154 genes in familial HBs. C: G>T: A and T: A>C: G mutations are relatively common in most HB patients. Genes harboring the most significant mutations include PCDH9, KLHL12, DCAF4L1, and VHL in sporadic HBs, and ZNF814, DLG2, RIMS1, PNN, and MUC7 in familial HBs. The frequency of CNV varied considerably within sporadic HBs but was relatively similar within familial HBs. Five genes, including OTOGL, PLCB4, SCEL, THSD4, and WWOX, have CNVs in the six patients with sporadic HBs, and three genes, including ABCA6, CWC27, and LAMA2, have CNVs in the five patients with familial HBs. We found new genetic mutations and CNVs that might be involved in HBs; these findings highlight the complexity of the tumorigenesis of HBs and pinpoint potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of HBs.

N2  - Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bifunctional molecules that recruit an E3 ligase to a target protein to facilitate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of that protein. While the field of targeted degraders is still relatively young, the potential for this modality to become a differentiated and therapeutic reality is strong, such that both academic and pharmaceutical institutions are now entering this interesting area of research. In this article, we describe a broadly applicable process for identifying degrader hits based on the serine/threonine kinase TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and have generalized the key structural elements associated with degradation activities. Compound 3i is a potent hit (TBK1 DC<sub>50</sub> = 12 nM, D<sub>max</sub> = 96%) with excellent selectivity against a related kinase IKKepsilon, which was further used as a chemical tool to assess TBK1 as a target in mutant K-Ras cancer cells.

N2  - The loss of the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) is a key oncogenic event in the vast majority of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). With the loss of the VHL protein (pVHL) function, the hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates inside the tumor cell and dimerizes with HIF-beta. The HIF-alpha/HIF-beta complex transcriptionally activates hundreds of genes promoting the adaptation to hypoxia that is implicated in tumor development. There is growing evidence showing that HIF-2alpha subunit has a central role in ccRCC over HIF-1alpha. Thus, efforts have been made to specifically target this pathway. PT2385 and PT2399 are first-in-class, orally available, small molecule inhibitors of HIF-2 that selectively disrupt the heterodimerization of HIF-2alpha with HIF-1beta. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that these new molecules are effective in blocking cancer cell growth, proliferation, and tumor angiogenesis characteristic in ccRCC. Treatment with HIF-2alpha specific antagonists, either alone or in combination with immunotherapy or other antiangiogenic agents have the potential to transform the therapeutic landscape in this tumor in the future. Herein, we summarize the molecular background behind the use of HIF-2alpha inhibitors in ccRCC and give an overview of the development of new agents in this setting. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Context: The co-occurrence of pheochromocytoma (PC) and renal tumors was linked to the inherited familial cancer syndrome von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease more than six decades ago. Subsequently, other shared genetic causes of predisposition to renal tumors and to PC, paraganglioma (PGL), or head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) have been described, but case series of non-VHL-related cases of renal tumor and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumor association syndrome (RAPTAS) are rare.Objective: To determine the clinical and molecular features of non-VHL RAPTAS by literature review and characterization of a case series.Design: A review of the literature was performed and a retrospective study of referrals for investigation of genetic causes of RAPTAS.Results: Literature review revealed evidence of an association, in addition to VHL disease, between germline mutations in SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, TMEM127, and MAX genes and RAPTAS [defined here as the co-occurrence of tumors from both classes (PC/PGL/HNPGL and renal tumors) in the same individual or in first-degree relatives]. In both the literature review and our case series of 22 probands with non-VHL RAPTAS, SDHB mutations were the most frequent cause of non-VHL RAPTAS. A genetic cause was identified in 36.3% (8/22) of kindreds.Conclusion: Renal tumors and PC/PGL/HNPGL tumors share common molecular features and their co-occurrence in an individual or family should prompt genetic investigations. We report a case of MAX-associated renal cell carcinoma and confirm the role of TMEM127 mutations with renal cell carcinoma predisposition.

N2  - Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are neuroendocrine tumors derived from the chromaffin tissue of the adrenal medulla or from extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia. These tumors affect one in 2500-6500 people, with 500-1600 patients diagnosed annually in the USA. Its real incidence is likely to be much higher, and many patients may die undiagnosed. It is a rare cause of secondary hypertension, with an incidence of 0.1-0.6%. PHEOs are more common than PGLs, and 5-7% is related to hormonal secretion. The average age of diagnosis is 43 years, but 10-20% of PHEO/PGL patients are children, and the tumors are generally associated with genetic conditions. The worldwide consensus is that people with PHEOs/PGLs should undergo a mandatory genetic investigation, especially with multiple injuries and those who are younger. Although many PHEOs are sporadic and benign, approximately 30% of familial tumor cases have been identified. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1 are classically linked to PHEO and mutations in succinate dehydrogenase complex subunits have been associated with familial forms. Our goal is to review various clinical syndromes in which PHEOs/PGLs are present, along with their therapeutic options. Copyright © 2016 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) are autosomal-dominant diseases caused by germline mutations in tumor-suppressor genes. A patient with a germline MEN1 mutation and a somatic VHL mutation in the tumor has not been reported. Herein, we report on a patient with MEN1 and a metastatic nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) with a somatic VHL mutation. This patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy for a grade 2 PNET obstructing her pancreatic duct. The patient developed liver and regional lymph node metastases as well as growth of a PNET in the remnant pancreas. As part of a clinical trial for mutation-targeted therapy, a biopsy of the metastatic tumor was obtained. The clinical diagnosis, confirmed by OncoVAR-NET and molecular profiling analysis, revealed MEN1 with a germline deletion in exon 2 and a c.402 deletion C, p.Phe134LeufsX51. In addition, a somatic mutation in the VHL gene-a nonsense mutation, c.529A>T, p.Arg177Ter-was identified by hybrid capture sequencing. The mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Comparative genomic hybridization showed loss of heterozygosity in both the MEN1 and VHL genes. The patient was treated with sunitinib and had a partial response to treatment. This case illustrates not only that a second hit occurs in tumor suppressor genes but that somatic mutations are also possible in additional tumor suppressor genes. This suggests that targeted therapy selection should include analysis of somatic mutations even when the susceptibility gene is known.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited condition associated with tumors in multiple organs, whose treatment requires heightened multidisciplinary teamwork. Therefore, a document summarizing all the pertinent knowledge is needed to enhance coordination of care.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review of the literature from the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central databases was performed. From 1970 to 2017, all articles meeting specific inclusion criteria were included by at least one specialist physician for each field.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We included 95 articles, mostly dealing with genetics or management of VHL associated tumors in one organ system. There were no papers discussing the manifestations of VHL altogether, which was the aim of our paper.CONCLUSIONS: VHL requires a multidisciplinary management to provide the highest quality of care. Coordination and communication between patients and caregivers is enhanced when knowledge is shared. Gathering together specialists in different domains around the production and reading of a comprehensive document such as the one hereby may contribute to this purpose.

N2  - The sphingosine kinase-1/sphingosine 1-phosphate (SphK1/S1P) signaling pathway has been reported to modulate the expression of the canonical transcription factor hypoxia-inducible HIF-1alpha in multiple cell lineages. HIF-2alpha is also frequently overexpressed in solid tumors but its role has been mostly studied in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common form of kidney cancer, where HIF-2alpha has been established as a driver of a more aggressive disease. In this study, the role of SphK1/S1P signaling with regard to HIF-2alpha was investigated in various cancer cell models including ccRCC cells. Under hypoxic conditions or in ccRCC lacking a functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and expressing high levels of HIF-2alpha, SphK1 activity controls HIF-2alpha expression and transcriptional activity through a phospholipase D (PLD)-driven mechanism. SphK1 silencing promotes a VHL-independent HIF-2alpha loss of expression and activity and reduces cell proliferation in ccRCC. Importantly, downregulation of SphK1 is associated with impaired Akt and mTOR signaling in ccRCC. Taking advantage of a monoclonal antibody neutralizing extracellular S1P, we show that inhibition of S1P extracellular signaling blocks HIF-2alpha accumulation in ccRCC cell lines, an effect mimicked when the S1P transporter Spns2 or the S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) is silenced. Here, we report the first evidence that the SphK1/S1P signaling pathway regulates the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible HIF-2alpha in diverse cancer cell lineages notably ccRCC, where HIF-2alpha has been established as a driver of a more aggressive disease. These findings demonstrate that SphK1/S1P signaling may act as a canonical regulator of HIF-2alpha expression in ccRCC, giving support to its inhibition as a therapeutic strategy that could contribute to reduce HIF-2 activity in ccRCC.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an important tumor suppressor that is lost in the majority of clear cell carcinoma of renal cancer (ccRCC). Its regulatory pathway involves the activity of E3 ligase, which targets hypoxia inducible factor alpha (including HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha) for proteasome degradation. In recent years, emerging literature suggests that VHL also possesses other HIF-independent functions. This review will focus on VHL-mediated signaling pathways involving the latest identified substrates/binding partners, including N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (NDRG3), AKT, and G9a, etc., and their physiological roles in hypoxia signaling and cancer. We will also discuss the crosstalk between VHL and NF-kappaB signaling. Lastly, we will review the latest findings on targeting VHL signaling in cancer.

N2  - Mammalian cells sense changes in oxygen and transduce that information into adaptive changes in gene expression using a conserved pathway that converges on the heterodimeric transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which contains a labile alpha subunit and a stable beta subunit. In the presence of oxygen, the alpha subunit is hydroxylated on one (or both) of two highly conserved prolyl residues by an Egg-Laying Defective Nine (EglN) [also called Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain (PHD)] dioxygenase, which recruits an ubiquitin ligase complex containing the VHL tumor suppressor gene product. Germline VHL mutations cause von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, which manifest as angiogenic tumors such as hemangioblastomas and kidney cancers. Somatic VHL inactivation and deregulation of HIF (especially HIF2alpha) drives sporadic kidney cancers and an HIF2alpha inhibitor is showing promise for this disease. VHL, EglN1, and HIF2alpha polymorphisms have been linked to familial polycythemia and adaptation to high altitude. Orally available EglN inhibitors are being developed for the treatment of anemia and ischemic diseases.

N2  - A number of inherited renal diseases present with renal cysts and often lead to end-stage renal disease. With recent advances in genetics, increasing number of genes and mutations have been associated with cystic renal diseases. Although genetic testing can provide a definite diagnosis, it is often reserved for equivocal cases or for ongoing investigational research. Therefore, imaging findings are essential in the routine diagnosis, follow-up, and detection of complications in patients with inherited cystic renal diseases. In this article, the most recent classification, genetic analysis, clinical presentations, and imaging findings of inherited cystic renal diseases will be discussed.

N2  - We report on a case of disseminated CNS hemangioblastoma, also referred to as hemangioblastomatosis, involving the supratentorial compartment and the entire spine. The patient presented with new onset headache, gait difficulties and memory deficits many years following resection of a hemangioblastoma from the cerebellum. The patient's family history was negative for von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, and his personal history was negative for any additional VHL-defining lesions. Imaging revealed extensive dural caking and nodularity both supratentorially and in the spine, along with scattered parenchymal tumors showing a more typical appearance for hemangioblastoma. Biopsy of the dural thickening revealed histologic features compatible with hemangioblastoma. Genetic testing for VHL was eventually completed, and no evidence of a germline VHL mutation was detected. Copyright © 2017 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - The hypoxia-regulated tumor-suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an E3 ligase that recognizes its substrates as part of an oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) reaction, with hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha) being its most notable substrate. Here we report that VHL has an equally important function distinct from its hypoxia-regulated activity. We find that Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a novel, hypoxia-independent target for VHL ubiquitination. In contrast to its hypoxia-regulated activity, VHL mono-, rather than poly-ubiquitinates AURKA, in a PHD-independent reaction targeting AURKA for degradation in quiescent cells, where degradation of AURKA is required to maintain the primary cilium. Tumor-associated variants of VHL differentiate between these two functions, as a pathogenic VHL mutant that retains intrinsic ability to ubiquitinate HIFalpha is unable to ubiquitinate AURKA. Together, these data identify VHL as an E3 ligase with important cellular functions under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

N2  - Alterations in chromatin accessibility independent of DNA methylation can affect cancer-related gene expression, but are often overlooked in conventional epigenomic profiling approaches. In this study, we describe a cost-effective and computationally simple assay called AcceSssIble to simultaneously interrogate DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility alterations in primary human clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Our study revealed significant perturbations to the ccRCC epigenome and identified gene expression changes that were specifically attributed to the chromatin accessibility status whether or not DNA methylation was involved. Compared with commonly mutated genes in ccRCC, such as the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor, the genes identified by AcceSssIble comprised distinct pathways and more frequently underwent epigenetic changes, suggesting that genetic and epigenetic alterations could be independent events in ccRCC. Specifically, we found unique DNA methylation-independent promoter accessibility alterations in pathways mimicking VHL deficiency. Overall, this study provides a novel approach for identifying new epigenetic-based therapeutic targets, previously undetectable by DNA methylation studies alone, that may complement current genetic-based treatment strategies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinicopathological association of PBRM1 (Polybromo-1 gene) and VHL (von Hippel-Lindau gene) expression at mRNA and protein levels in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and its role in tumor progression.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis, Western blotting and qPCR analysis of PBRM1 and VHL were performed on fresh-frozen ccRCC and adjacent normal tissue obtained from 70 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy. In addition, a tissue microarray (TMA) from specimens of 326 ccRCC patients was used to evaluate the effect of loss of PBRM1 and VHL immunohistological expression on clinicopathological features as well as patient survival.RESULTS: In frozen tissue, PBRM1 and VHL mRNA were significantly down-regulated in most ccRCC tumors (77.6%/80.6%). Simultaneous weak PBRM1 and VHL protein expression was observed in 21.4% of frozen tumors. In the TMA samples, weak PBRM1 and VHL immunohistochemical staining was observed in 60.4% of the cases and was correlated (P<0.001). The association of PBRM1 and VHL immunohistochemical expression with clinicopathological parameters depicts a variable picture: predominantly weak PBRM1 and VHL expression were significantly associated with higher Fuhrman grade (P = 0.012 and 0.024, respectively) but only weak VHL expression was associated with a higher pT stage (P = 0.023). PBRM1 expression did not affect the overall survival, whereas weak VHL expression was associated with decreased patient overall survival (P = 0.013).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that reduced expression of PBRM1 and VHL is correlated with an increased tumor aggressiveness. Low VHL expression was identified as a risk factor for worse patient overall survival, independently from PBRM1 expression pattern.

N2  - About 30% of phaeochromocytomas or paragangliomas are genetic. Whilst some individuals will have clinical features or a family history of inherited cancer syndrome such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2), the majority will present as an isolated case. To date, 14 genes have been described in which pathogenic mutations have been demonstrated to cause paraganglioma or phaeochromocytoma. Many cases with a pathogenic mutation may be at risk of developing further tumours. Therefore, identification of genetic cases is important in the long-term management of these individuals, ensuring that they are entered into a surveillance programme. Mutation testing also facilitates cascade testing within the family, allowing identification of other at-risk individuals. Many algorithms have been described to facilitate cost-effective genetic testing sequentially of these genes, with phenotypically driven pathways. New genetic technologies including next-generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing will allow much quicker, cheaper and extensive testing of individuals in whom a genetic aetiology is suspected.

N2  - It is well established that hypoxia contributes to tumor progression in a hypoxia inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha)-dependent manner in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), yet the role of long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) involved in hypoxia-mediated RCC progression remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that LncRNA-SARCC (Suppressing Androgen Receptor in Renal Cell Carcinoma) is differentially regulated by hypoxia in a von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-dependent manner both in RCC cell culture and clinical specimens. LncRNA-SARCC can suppress hypoxic cell cycle progression in the VHL-mutant RCC cells while derepress it in the VHL-restored RCC cells. Mechanism dissection reveals that LncRNA-SARCC can post-transcriptionally regulate androgen receptor (AR) by physically binding and destablizing AR protein to suppress AR/HIF-2alpha/C-MYC signals. In return, HIF-2alpha can transcriptionally regulate the LncRNA-SARCC expression via binding to hypoxia-responsive elements on the promoter of LncRNA-SARCC. The negative feedback modulation between LncRNA-SARCC/AR complex and HIF-2alpha signaling may then lead to differentially modulated RCC progression in a VHL-dependent manner. Together, these results may provide us a new therapeutic approach via targeting this newly identified signal from LncRNA-SARCC to AR-mediated HIF-2alpha/C-MYC signals against RCC progression.

N2  - Both the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway and microRNA (miRNA) regulation are important mechanisms underlying the development and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here we demonstrate that VHL deficiency leads to downregulation of Dicer and, in turn, defects in the miRNA biogenesis machinery in ccRCCs. Dicer inhibited expression of HIF-2alpha, which was a direct target of Dicer-dependent miR-182-5p in VHL-deficient ccRCCs. Ectopic Dicer expression in VHL-deficient ccRCCs suppressed tumor growth and angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-2alpha both in vitro and in vivo. Reduced Dicer mRNA levels served as an independent prognostic factor for poor survival in patients with VHL-deficient ccRCC. Our results indicate that downregulation of Dicer in VHL-deficient ccRCCs contributes to high levels of HIF-2alpha and a malignant phenotype, which suggests Dicer could be a useful therapeutic target for managing this disease.

N2  - Introduction: Germline inactivating variants in the VHL gene cause dominantly inherited von Hippel-Lindau syndrome characterized by hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cysts, pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Approximately 72% of the pathogenic variants are sequence variants and 28% large deletions. Nearly all individuals with a VHL mutation will develop symptoms by age 65. Due to age dependent penetrance, variable expression, incomplete family segregation information and somatic occurrence, VHL variant classification can be challenging. The purpose of this study is to use newly established guidelines to reclassify variants detected by our clinical laboratory over 14 years. This extensive dataset is used to update the mutation spectrum and aid future VHL variant assessment. Methods: A retrospective review of 3,205 cases submitted to our laboratory for VHL gene analysis since 2002 was conducted. These cases were previously tested by Sanger sequencing for sequence variants and Southern blot analysis, relative quantitative PCR or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for large deletions/duplications. Variants were reassessed using our laboratory's criteria modified from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guideline. Resources used for reclassifications included published literature, databases, and family segregation information focusing on the collection of new evidence that emerged since last assessment. Results: Out of 3,205 cases, 861 had a test finding with 21.6% having partial or whole VHL gene deletions and 78.4% with sequence variants. Reclassification of 186 unique sequence variants yielded 62.3% pathogenic, 21% likely pathogenic, 13% variant of uncertain significance (VOUS), 3.2% likely benign and 0.5% benign calls. Of these, 42 novel variants were identified in our patients that have not been published or reported in public databases and an additional 14 germline variants were previously reported in COSMIC only. Classification of novel variants yielded 55.4% pathogenic, 8.9% likely pathogenic, 26.8% VOUS and 8.9% likely benign calls. Among a total of 155 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, 47.1% were missense, 31.6% frameshift, 13.5% nonsense, 5.2% splicing, and 2.6% in-frame deletions/insertions. Conclusions: This study utilized our laboratory's database to reclassify VHL variants using established guidelines and updated information. This knowledge database can be used for future classification of VHL variants, which will be of benefit to clinicians who care for these families. Therefore this information was submitted to ClinVar for public dissemination. The experience gained from this study can also help variant classification in other cancer-predisposition genes.

N2  - Hereditary forms of kidney carcinoma account for 5-8% of all malignant kidney neoplasms. The renal tumors are often multiple and bilateral and occur at an earlier age. Each of the hereditary kidney carcinoma syndromes is associated with specific gene mutations as well as a specific histologic type of kidney carcinoma. The presence of associated extrarenal manifestations may suggest a hereditary kidney cancer syndrome. Radiology is most commonly used to screen and manage patients with hereditary kidney cancer syndromes. This manuscript reviews the clinical and imaging findings of well-defined inherited kidney cancer syndromes including von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, hereditary papillary renal carcinoma syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, and Lynch syndrome.

N2  - P53 is often mutated in solid tumors, in fact, somatic changes involving the gene encoding for p53 (TP53) have been discovered in more than 50% of human malignancies and several data confirmed that p53 mutations represent an early event in cancerogenesis. Main p53 functions consist in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and apoptosis induction in response to mutagenic stimuli, and, to exert those functions, p53 acts as transcriptional factor. Recent data have highlighted another very important role of p53, consisting in regulate cell metabolism and cell response to oxidative stress. Majority of tumor suppressor genes, such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), retinoblastoma-associated protein (RB) and Von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) are inactivated by deletion or early truncation mutations in tumors, resulting in the decreased or loss of expression of their proteins. Differently, most p53 mutations in human cancer are missense mutations, which result in the production of full-length mutant p53 proteins. It has been reported that mutant p53 proteins and wild type p53 proteins often regulate same cellular biological processes with opposite effects. So, mutant p53 has been reported to supply the cancer cells of glucose and nutrients, and, to avoid reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated damage during oxidative stress. These last features are able to render tumor cells resistant to ionizing radiations and chemotherapy. A future therapeutic approach in tumors bearing p53 mutations may be to deplete cancer cells of their energy reserves and antioxidants.

N2  - Neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis complex, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, historically classified as the phakomatoses, are hereditary multisystem disorders characterized by the presence of hamartoma, which carry the risk of malignant transformation. The alteration of tumor suppressor genes seems to be at the basis of their pathophysiogenetic mechanism. Lisch and choroidal nodules in neurofibromatosis type 1, retinal astrocytomas in tuberous sclerosis complex, and retinal capillary hemangioma in Von Hippel-Lindau disease are the principal ophthalmic hamartomatous manifestations. The advent of novel imaging techniques such as near infrared reflectance and optical coherence tomography has provided unprecedented insight on the choroidal and retinal features of these diseases. These methods have improved early diagnosis and the ongoing surveillance in these conditions. Among an array of treatment modalities, antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy has been used in the management of retinal hamartomas but results have been varied. This review is an update on the pathophysiogenetic mechanisms, ophthalmic manifestations, and novel treatment strategies in the phakomatoses with emphasis on the role of imaging techniques.

N2  - Objective Peritumoral cysts are frequently associated with CNS hemangioblastomas and often underlie neurological morbidity and mortality. To determine their natural history and clinical impact, the authors prospectively analyzed hemangioblastoma-associated peritumoral cysts in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. methods Patients with VHL disease who had 2 or more years of follow-up and who were enrolled in a prospective study at the National Institutes of Health were included. Serial prospectively acquired laboratory, genetic, imaging, and clinical data were analyzed. results One hundred thirty-two patients (of 225 in the VHL study with at least 2 years of follow-up) had peritumoral cysts that were followed for more than 2 years (total of 292 CNS peritumoral cysts). The mean age at study entrance was 37.4 +/- 13.1 years ([mean +/- SD], median 37.9, range 12.3-65.1 years). The mean follow-up was 7.0 +/- 1.7 years (median 7.3, range 2.1-9.0 years). Over the study period, 121 of the 292 peritumoral cysts (41.4%) became symptomatic. Development of new cysts was associated with a larger number cysts at study enrollment (p = 0.002) and younger age (p < 0.0001). Cyst growth rate was associated with anatomical location (cerebellum cysts grew faster than spine and brainstem cysts; p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0008), younger age (< 35 years of age; p = 0.0006), and development of new neurological symptoms (p < 0.0001). Cyst size at symptom production depended on anatomical location (p < 0.0001; largest to smallest were found, successively, in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and brainstem). The most common location for peritumoral cysts was the cerebellum (184 cysts [63%]; p < 0.0001). coNclusioNs Peritumoral cysts frequently underlie symptom formation that requires surgical intervention in patients with VHL disease. Development of new cysts was associated with a larger number of cysts at study enrollment and younger age. Total peritumoral cyst burden was associated with germline partial deletion of the VHL gene.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare in children and limited data are available. We aimed to specify tumour and patient characteristics and to investigate the role of genetic predisposition in the aetiology of paediatric NETs.METHODS: Using the Dutch Pathology Registry PALGA, we collected patient- and tumour data of paediatric NETs in the Netherlands between 1991 and 2013 (N=483).RESULTS: The incidence of paediatric NETs in the Netherlands is 5.40 per one million per year. The majority of NETs were appendiceal tumours (N=441;91.3%). Additional surgery in appendiceal NETs was indicated in 89 patients, but performed in only 27 of these patients. Four out of five patients with pancreatic NETs were diagnosed with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (N=2) and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (N=2). In one patient with an appendiceal NET Familial Adenomatous Polyposis was diagnosed. On the basis of second primary tumours or other additional diagnoses, involvement of genetic predisposition was suggestive in several others.CONCLUSIONS: We identified a significant number of patients with a confirmed or suspected tumour predisposition syndrome and show that paediatric pancreatic NETs in particular are associated with genetic syndromes. In addition, we conclude that treatment guidelines for appendiceal paediatric NETs need revision and improved implementation.

N2  - Although hereditary kidney cancer syndrome accounts for approximately five percent of all kidney cancers, the mechanistic insight into tumor development in these rare conditions has provided the foundation for the development of molecular targeting agents currently used for sporadic kidney cancer. In the late 1980s, the comprehensive study for hereditary kidney cancer syndrome was launched in the National Cancer Institute, USA and the first kidney cancer-associated gene, VHL, was identified through kindred analysis of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome in 1993. Subsequent molecular studies on VHL function have elucidated that the VHL protein is a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which provided the basis for the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the HIF-VEGF/PDGF pathway. Recent whole-exome sequencing analysis of sporadic kidney cancer exhibited the recurrent mutations in chromatin remodeling genes and the later study has revealed that several chromatin remodeling genes are altered in kidney cancer kindred at the germline level. To date, more than 10 hereditary kidney cancer syndromes together with each responsible gene have been characterized and most of the causative genes for these genetic disorders are associated with either metabolism or epigenome regulation. In this review article, we describe the molecular mechanisms of how an alteration of each kidney cancer-associated gene leads to renal tumorigenesis as well as denote therapeutic targets elicited by studies on hereditary kidney cancer.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A key feature of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (pVHL) that leads to the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway also in well-oxygenated conditions. Important regulator of HIF-alpha, prolyl hydroxylase PHD3, is expressed in high amounts in ccRCC. Although several functions and downstream targets for PHD3 in cancer have been suggested, the role of elevated PHD3 expression in ccRCC is not clear.METHODS: To gain insight into the functions of high PHD3 expression in ccRCC, we used PHD3 knockdown by siRNA in 786-O cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and performed discovery mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of the purified peptide samples. The LC-MS/MS results were analysed by label-free quantification of proteome data using a peptide-level expression-change averaging procedure and subsequent gene ontology enrichment analysis.RESULTS: Our data reveals an intriguingly widespread effect of PHD3 knockdown with 91 significantly regulated proteins. Under hypoxia, the response to PHD3 silencing was wider than under normoxia illustrated by both the number of regulated proteins and by the range of protein expression levels. The main cellular functions regulated by PHD3 expression were glucose metabolism, protein translation and messenger RNA (mRNA) processing. PHD3 silencing led to downregulation of most glycolytic enzymes from glucose transport to lactate production supported by the reduction in extracellular acidification and lactate production and increase in cellular oxygen consumption rate. Moreover, upregulation of mRNA processing-related proteins and alteration in a number of ribosomal proteins was seen as a response to PHD3 silencing. Further studies on upstream effectors of the translational machinery revealed a possible role for PHD3 in regulation of mTOR pathway signalling.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest crucial involvement of PHD3 in the maintenance of key cellular functions including glycolysis and protein synthesis in ccRCC.

N2  - Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) is an adhesion molecule assigned to the activated endothelium mediating immune cells adhesion and extravasation. However, its expression in renal carcinomas inversely correlates with tumor malignancy. Our experiments in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines demonstrated that von Hippel Lindau (VHL) loss, hypoxia, or PHD (for prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins) inactivation decreased VCAM-1 levels through a transcriptional mechanism that was independent of the hypoxia-inducible factor and dependent on the nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway. Conversely, VHL expression leads to high VCAM-1 levels in ccRCC, which in turn leads to better outcomes, possibly by favoring antitumor immunity through VCAM-1 interaction with the alpha4beta1 integrin expressed in immune cells. Remarkably, in ccRCC human samples with VHL nonmissense mutations, we observed a negative correlation between VCAM-1 levels and ccRCC stage, microvascular invasion, and symptom presentation, pointing out the clinical value of VCAM-1 levels as a marker of ccRCC progression.

N2  - Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) eliminates transcripts with premature termination codons. Although NMD-induced loss-of-function has been shown to contribute to the genesis of particular cancers, its global functional consequence in tumours has not been characterized. Here we develop an algorithm to predict NMD and apply it on somatic mutations reported in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identify more than 73 K mutations that are predicted to elicit NMD (NMD-elicit). NMD-elicit mutations in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) are associated with significant reduction in gene expression. We discover cancer-specific NMD-elicit signatures in TSGs and cancer-associated genes. Our analysis reveals a previously unrecognized dependence of hypermutated tumours on hypofunction of genes that are involved in chromatin remodelling and translation. Half of hypermutated stomach adenocarcinomas are associated with NMD-elicit mutations of the translation initiators LARP4B and EIF5B. Our results unravel strong therapeutic opportunities by targeting tumour dependencies on NMD-elicit mutations. Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: ALT1 is a novel long non-coding RNA derived from the alternatively spliced transcript of the deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2 (DLEU2). To date, ALT1 biological roles in human vascular endothelial cells have not been reported.METHODS: ALT1 was knocked down by siRNAs. Cell proliferation was analyzed by cck-8. The existence and sequence of human ALT1 were identified by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The interaction between lncRNA and proteins was analyzed by RNA-Protein pull down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry analysis.RESULTS: ALT1 was expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression of ALT1 was significantly downregulated in contact-inhibited HUVECs and in hypoxia-induced, growth-arrested HUVECs. Knocking down of ALT1 inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. We observed that angiotensin converting enzyme II(ACE2) was a direct target gene of ALT1. Knocking-down of ALT1 or its target gene ACE2 could efficiently decrease the expression of cyclin D1 via the enhanced ubiquitination and degradation, in which HIF-1alpha and protein von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) might be involved.CONCLUSION: The results suggested the human long non-coding RNA ALT1 is a novel regulator for cell cycle of HUVECs via ACE2 and cyclin D1 pathway.

N2  - The primary neurologic involvement in both von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is vascular tumor/vascular malformation, but molecular pathogenesis, long-term symptom evolution, and treatment are quite different. VHL is caused by dominant inherited or de novo germline mutations, while SWS is caused by somatic mosaicism. A diagnosis of VHL carries substantial cancer risk, while the clinical issues in SWS are primarily related to the consequences of the intracranial vascular abnormalities.

N2  - Recent studies have reported that chemically synthesized double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), also known as small activating RNA (saRNAs), can specifically induce gene expression by targeting promoter sequences by a mechanism termed RNA activation (RNAa). In the present study, we designed 4 candidate saRNAs targeting the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene promoter. Among these saRNAs, dsVHL-821 significantly inhibited cell growth by up-regulating VHL at both the mRNA and protein levels in renal cell carcinoma 769-P cells. Functional analysis showed that dsVHL-821 induced apoptosis by increasing p53, decreasing Bcl-xL, activating caspase 3/7 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that dsVHL-821 increased the enrichment of Ago2 and RNA polymerase II at the dsVHL-821 target site. In addition, Ago2 depletion significantly suppressed dsVHL-821-induced up-regulation of VHL gene expression and related effects. Single transfection of dsVHL-821 caused long-lasting (14 days) VHL up-regulation. Furthermore, the activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 was accompanied by an increase in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of histone 4 (H4ac) and a decrease in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2) in the dsVHL-821 target region. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dsVHL-821, a novel saRNA for VHL, induces the expression of the VHL gene by epigenetic changes, leading to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and suggest that targeted activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 may be explored as a novel treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

N2  - Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) directs an extensive transcriptional cascade that transduces numerous adaptive responses to hypoxia. Pan-genomic analyses, using chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcript profiling, have revealed large numbers of HIF-binding sites that are generally associated with hypoxia-inducible transcripts, even over long chromosomal distances. However, these studies do not define the specific targets of HIF-binding sites and do not reveal how induction of HIF affects chromatin conformation over distantly connected functional elements. To address these questions, we deployed a recently developed chromosome conformation assay that enables simultaneous high-resolution analyses from multiple viewpoints. These assays defined specific long-range interactions between intergenic HIF-binding regions and one or more promoters of hypoxia-inducible genes, revealing the existence of multiple enhancer-promoter, promoter-enhancer, and enhancer-enhancer interactions. However, neither short-term activation of HIF by hypoxia, nor long-term stabilization of HIF in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective cells greatly alters these interactions, indicating that at least under these conditions, HIF can operate on preexisting patterns of chromatin-chromatin interactions that define potential transcriptional targets and permit rapid gene activation by hypoxic stress.

    9 pancreatic tumours with germline VHL mutations, but unknown mutation and other patient phenotype
N2  - BACKGROUND: Nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NFPanNETs) may be sporadic or inherited because of germline mutations associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). The clinical behavior of NFPanNETs is difficult to predict, even in tumors of the same stage and grade. The authors analyzed genotype-specific patterns of transcriptional messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of NFPanNETs to understand the molecular features that determine PanNET phenotype.METHODS: Thirty-two samples were included for genome-wide mRNA gene expression analysis (9 VHL-associated, 10 MEN1-associated, and 9 sporadic NFPanNETs and 4 purified normal islet cell [NIC] samples). Validation of genes was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry. Gene expression profiles were analyzed by tumor genotype, and pathway analysis was curated.RESULTS: Consensus clustering of mRNA expression revealed separate clustering of NICs, VHL-associated NFPanNETs, and MEN1-associated NFPanNETs; whereas some sporadic tumors clustered with MEN1. Four of 5 MEN1-like sporadic PanNET subtypes had loss of heterozygosity at the MEN1 gene locus. Pathway analysis demonstrated subtype-specific pathway activation, comprising angiogenesis and immune response in VHL; neuronal development in MEN1; protein ubiquitination in the new MEN1/sporadic subtype; and cytokinesis and cilium/microtubule development in sporadic NFPanNETs. Among many genes, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (Lef-1), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and CDK6 were upregulated in VHL or MEN1 NFPanNETs, providing potential subtype-specific treatment targets.CONCLUSIONS: Distinct mRNA expression patterns were identified in sporadic-associated, VHL-associated, and MEN1-associated NFPanNETs. The current results uncover new pathways involved in NFPanNETs that are subtype-specific and provide potential new diagnostic or therapeutic targets based on tumor subtype.

N2  - Intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCT) are rare lesions in the pediatric population, accounting for 4-8 % of central nervous system tumors in children (Bowers and Weprin 2003; DeSousa et al. 1979; Barker et al. 1976). They represent 55 % of intradural tumors in this age group (Yamamoto and Raffel 1999). They occur with an approximate incidence of 1 in 100,000, with 100-200 cases of pediatric IMSCTs diagnosed each year in the United States (Constantini and Epstein 1995; Constantini 1996). The majority of these lesions (nearly 60 %) are encountered in the cervical and thoracic regions and rarely involve the lumbar cord (Goh et al. 2000; Cooper 1989). They are distributed evenly between male and female patients (Goh et al. 1997). Primary glial tumors such as ependymomas and astrocytomas account for at least 80 % of IMSCTs (Cooper 1989; Cristante and Herrmann 1994; Epstein et al. 1993; Hoshimaru et al. 1999; McCormick et al. 1990b; Sandler et al. 1992). Other less common but reported pediatric IMSCT tumor types include ganglioglioma (Lang et al. 1993; Hayashi et al. 2011), oligodendroglioma (Miller 2000), and hemangioblastoma (Lang et al. 1993; Roonprapunt et al. 2001; Weil et al. 2003). Rarer still have been case reports of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (Alexiou et al. 2013), subependymoma (Miller and McCutcheon 2000), pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (Das et al. 2014), neurocytoma (Singh et al. 2007), schwannoma (Kim et al. 2009), teratoma (Isik et al. 2008), germinoma (Madhukar et al. 2013), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Bhushanam et al. 2014).

N2  - Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bispecific molecules containing a target protein binder and an ubiquitin ligase binder connected by a linker. By recruiting an ubiquitin ligase to a target protein, PROTACs promote ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the target protein. The generation of effective PROTACs depends on the nature of the protein/ligase ligand pair, linkage site, linker length, and linker composition, all of which have been difficult to address in a systematic way. Herein, we describe a "click chemistry" approach for the synthesis of PROTACs. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with the bromodomain and extraterminal domain-4 (BRD4) ligand JQ-1 (3) and ligase binders targeting cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) proteins. An AlphaScreen proximity assay was used to determine the ability of PROTACs to form the ternary ligase-PROTAC-target protein complex and a MSD assay to measure cellular degradation of the target protein promoted by PROTACs.

N2  - Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a key component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). EZH2 is frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of human malignancies including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. Thus it has potential to become a therapeutic target. Characterization of EZH2 as a therapeutic target in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has not been fully explored. ccRCC have been defined by mutation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene in combination with chromosome 3p loss. Recent sequencing efforts have revealed that several chromatin remodeling genes encoded on chromosome 3p are often mutated, of which PBRM1 is the most frequent (41%). The PBRM1 gene codes for the BAF180 protein, a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit. Loss of BAF180 in ccRCC may disrupt the PBAF variant of the SWI/SNF complex. The SWI/SNF complex remodels the chromatin landscape by either sliding or evicting the nucleosomes from the chromatin. This chromatin remodeling modulates the accessibility to promoter regions by transcriptional machinery. It is through this mechanism that the SWI/SNF complex can regulate a range of cellular processes. It has been demonstrated that the SWI/SNF complex can act antagonistically to the PRC2 complex by evicting PRC2 complex from the promoters of tumor suppressors such as CDKN2A/p16. Disruption of the SWI/SNF complex would impede the eviction of the PRC2 complex, similarly observed in SNF5-deficient malignant rhabdoid tumors. Therefore, we hypothesize that PBRM1 inactivation disrupts specific SWI/SNF complexes allowing EZH2 to bind and repress target tumor suppressor genes. Thus inhibition of EZH2 in ccRCC may present as a targeted therapeutic option in tumors with PBRM1 mutations. We have investigated EZH2 in ccRCC cell lines with PBRM1 mutations and observed that these cells lines have overexpression of EZH2 in comparison to RPTEC (renal cortex proximal tubule epithelium cell line). We examined the effects on two EZH2 inhibitors (GSK126 and EPZ6438) on ccRCC cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary data suggests EZH2 inhibition results in reduced growth of ccRCC cell lines with PBRM1 mutations.

N2  - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene mutations induce neural tissue hemangioblastomas, as well as highly vascularized clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs). Pathological vessel remodeling arises from misregulation of HIFs and VEGF, among other genes. Variation in disease penetrance has long been recognized in relation to genotype. We show Vhl mutations also disrupt Notch signaling, causing mutation-specific vascular abnormalities, e.g., type 1 (null) vs. type 2B (murine G518A representing human R167Q). In conditional mutation retina vasculature, Vhl-null mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/fl) had little effect on initial vessel branching, but it severely reduced arterial and venous branching at later stages. Interestingly, this mutation accelerated arterial maturation, as observed in retina vessel morphology and aberrant alpha-smooth muscle actin localization, particularly in vascular pericytes. RNA sequencing analysis identified gene expression changes within several key pathways, including Notch and smooth muscle cell contractility. Notch inhibition failed to reverse later-stage branching defects but rescued the accelerated arterialization. Retinal vessels harboring the type 2B Vhl mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/2B) displayed stage-specific changes in vessel branching and an advanced progression toward an arterial phenotype. Disrupting Notch signaling in type 2B mutants increased both artery and vein branching and restored arterial maturation toward nonmutant levels. By revealing differential effects of the null and type 2B Vhl mutations on vessel branching and maturation, these data may provide insight into the variability of VHL-associated vascular changes - particularly the heterogeneity and aggressiveness in ccRCC vessel growth - and also suggest Notch pathway targets for treating VHL syndrome.
