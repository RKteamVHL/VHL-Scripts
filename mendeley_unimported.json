These alterations vary between tumor types, and to employ metabolic targeting to its fullest potential there is a need for robust methods that identify candidate targetable metabolic pathways in individual cancers. Currently, such methods include 13C-tracing studies and mass spectrometry/ magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. Due to high cost and complexity, such studies are restricted to a research setting. We here present the validation of a novel technique of metabolic profiling, based on multiplex targeted next generation sequencing of RNA with single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), designed to measure activity of and mutations in genes that encode metabolic enzymes. We here profiled an isogenic pair of cell lines, differing in expression of the Von Hippel Lindau protein, an important regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes. We show that smMIP-profiling provides relevant information on active metabolic pathways. Because smMIP-based targeted RNAseq is cost-effective and can be applied in a medium high-throughput setting (200 samples can be profiled simultaneously in one next generation sequencing run) it is a highly interesting approach for profiling of the activity of genes of interest, including those regulating metabolism, in a routine patient care setting.", "author_address": "(de Bitter, van de Water, van den Heuvel, Zeelen, Eijkelenboom, Tops, van Lith, Leenders) Dept of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Oosterwijk, Kolev, Mulders) Dept of Urology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Ter Laan) Dept of Neurosurgery, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands", "accession_number": "625950427", "authors": ["de Bitter, T.", "van de Water, C.", "van den Heuvel, C.", "Zeelen, C.", "Eijkelenboom, A.", "Tops, B.", "Oosterwijk, E.", "Kolev, D.", "Mulders, P.", "Ter Laan, M.", "van Lith, S.", "Leenders, W."], "date": "12 Sep", "name_of_database": "Embase", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-11035-0", "database_provider": "Ovid Technologies", "number": "1", "keywords": ["adult", "article", "cell line", "controlled study", "DNA probe", "enzyme activity", "female", "gene expression", "gene mutation", "genetic transcription", "human", "human cell", "hypoxia", "major clinical study", "male", "malignant neoplasm", "mass spectrometry", "next generation sequencing", "patient care", "protein expression", "validation process", "endogenous compound", "transcriptome", "von Hippel Lindau protein"], "language": "English", "year": "2017", "issn": "2045-2322", "start_page": "11402", "short_title": "Profiling of the metabolic transcriptome via single molecule molecular inversion probes", "secondary_title": "Scientific reports", "title": "Profiling of the metabolic transcriptome via single molecule molecular inversion probes", "url": "https://uhn.idm.oclc.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emexb&AN=625950427 http://nt2yt7px7u.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=OVID:Embase&genre=article&id=pmid:28900252&id=doi:10.1038%2Fs41598-017-11035-0&issn=2045-2322&volume=7&issue=1&spage=11402&pages=11402&date=2017&title=Scientific+reports&atitle=Profiling+of+the+metabolic+transcriptome+via+single+molecule+molecular+inversion+probes&aulast=de+Bitter&pid=%3Cauthor%3Ede+Bitter+T.%3C%2Fauthor%3E&%3CAN%3E625950427%3C%2FAN%3E", "volume": "7", "id": "186"}], "10.1007/s00345-018-2429-x": [{"type_of_reference": "JOUR", "abstract": "PURPOSE: Clear cell, papillary cell, and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) have now been well characterised thanks to large collaborative projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor which is involved in cellular metabolic reprogramming by modulating gene expressions of enzymes including glycolysis pathway and oxygen utilization of mitochondria, we examined the functional role of HIF-1 activity in propofol-induced cell death. The role of HIF-1 activity on oxygen and energy metabolisms and propofol-induced cell death and caspase activity was examined in renal cell-derived RCC4 cells: RCC4-EV cells which lack von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL) protein expression and RCC4-VHL cells, which express exogenous VHL, and in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. It was demonstrated that HIF-1 is involved in suppressing oxygen consumption and facilitating glycolysis in cells and that the resistance to propofol-induced cell death was established in a HIF-1 activation-dependent manner. It was also demonstrated that HIF-1 activation by treatment with HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors such as n-propyl gallate and dimethyloxaloylglycine, alleviated the toxic effects of propofol. Thus, the resistance to propofol toxicity was conferred by HIF-1 activation by not only genetic deletion of VHL but also exposure to HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors.", "author_address": "Sumi, Chisato.

Despite this state of affairs, this fascinating and highly morbid disease frequently is under-represented, or even absent, from the curriculum of nephrologists in training and generally is underemphasized in national nephrology meetings, both scientific as well as clinical. Although classic concepts in cancer research in general had led to the concept that cancer is a disease resulting from mutations in the control of growth-regulating pathways, reinforced by the discovery of oncogenes, more contemporary research, particularly in kidney cancer, has uncovered changes in metabolic pathways mediated by those same genes that control tumor energetics and biosynthesis. This adaptation of classic biochemical pathways to the tumor's advantage has been labeled metabolic reprogramming. For example, in the case of kidney cancer there exists a near-universal presence of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) inactivation in the most common form, clear cell RCC (ccRCC), leading to activation of hypoxia-relevant and other metabolic pathways. Studies of this and other pathways in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) have been particularly revealing, leading to the concept that ccRCC can itself be considered a metabolic disease. For this reason, the relatively new method of metabolomics has become a useful technique in the study of ccRCC to tease out those pathways that have been reprogrammed by the tumor to its maximum survival advantage. Furthermore, identification of the nodes of such pathways can lead to novel areas for drug intervention in a disease for which such targets are seriously lacking. Further research and dissemination of these concepts, likely using omics techniques, will lead to clinical trials of therapeutics specifically targeted to tumor metabolism, rather than those generally toxic to all proliferating cells. Such novel agents are highly likely to be more effective than existing drugs and to have far fewer adverse effects. This review provides a general overview of the technique of metabolomics and then discusses how it and other omics techniques have been used to further our understanding of the basic biology of kidney cancer as well as to identify new therapeutic approaches.", "author_address": "Weiss, Robert H.

The immunochemical analysis of 356 RCCs revealed high abundance of apoA-I and apoB, as well as scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) in the ccRCC subtype. Given the characteristic loss of VHL function in ccRCC, we used VHL-defective and VHL-proficient cells to study the potential influence of VHL on lipoprotein uptake. VHL-defective patient-derived ccRCC cells and cell lines (786O and RCC4) showed enhanced uptake as well as less resecretion and degradation of radio-iodinated HDL and LDL (<sup>125</sup>I-HDL and <sup>125</sup>I-LDL, respectively) compared with the VHL-proficient cells. The ccRCC cells showed enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and SR-BI expression compared with normal kidney epithelial cells. Uptake of <sup>125</sup>I-HDL and <sup>125</sup>I-LDL by patient-derived normal kidney epithelial cells as well as the VHL-reexpressing ccRCC cell lines, 786-O-VHL and RCC4-O-VHL cells, was strongly enhanced by VEGF treatment. The knockdown of the VEGF coreceptor, neuropilin-1 (NRP1), as well as blocking of SR-BI significantly reduced the uptake of lipoproteins into ccRCC cells in vitro. LDL stimulated proliferation of 786-O cells more potently than 786-O-VHL cells in a NRP1- and SR-BI-dependent manner. In conclusion, enhanced lipoprotein uptake due to increased activities of VEGF/NRP1 and SR-BI promotes lipid accumulation and proliferation of VHL-defective ccRCC cells.", "author_address": "Velagapudi, Srividya.

In the present study, we designed 4 candidate saRNAs targeting the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene promoter. Among these saRNAs, dsVHL-821 significantly inhibited cell growth by up-regulating VHL at both the mRNA and protein levels in renal cell carcinoma 769-P cells. Functional analysis showed that dsVHL-821 induced apoptosis by increasing p53, decreasing Bcl-xL, activating caspase 3/7 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase in a dose-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that dsVHL-821 increased the enrichment of Ago2 and RNA polymerase II at the dsVHL-821 target site. In addition, Ago2 depletion significantly suppressed dsVHL-821-induced up-regulation of VHL gene expression and related effects. Single transfection of dsVHL-821 caused long-lasting (14 days) VHL up-regulation. Furthermore, the activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 was accompanied by an increase in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of histone 4 (H4ac) and a decrease in dimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) and lysine 27 (H3K27me2) in the dsVHL-821 target region. Taken together, these results demonstrate that dsVHL-821, a novel saRNA for VHL, induces the expression of the VHL gene by epigenetic changes, leading to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis, and suggest that targeted activation of VHL by dsVHL-821 may be explored as a novel treatment of renal cell carcinoma.", "author_address": "Kang, Moo Rim.

Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is by far the most common, followed by the papillary and chromophobe subtypes. Sarcomatoid differentiation is a morphologic change that can be seen in all subtypes that typically portends a poor prognosis. In the past, treatment options for RCC were limited to cytokine-based therapy with a high-toxicity profile and low response rate. An increased understanding of the molecular basis of RCC has led to substantial improvement in treatment options in the form of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. A significant early discovery in RCC was frequent inactivation of the Von Hippel Lindau gene in ccRCC, which ultimately led to the development of vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Further genomic sequencing of ccRCC tumors has identified other common mutations including BAP-1, PBRM1, SETD2, and PIK3CA. Many recent studies have explored how these mutations can affect prognosis and response to treatment. Likewise, papillary RCC has also been studied at the molecular level, which has shown a high level of mutations in the MET gene; early clinical data suggest the utility of MET targeted therapy. Finally, regarding the rarer sarcomatoid tumors, mutations in TP53 and NF2 may be important to their development. As we continue to learn more about what drives RCC at the molecular level, treatment options for RCC patients are diversifying.", "author_address": "D'Avella, Christopher.

To date, knowledge on VHL genetic and epigenetic regulation is restricted to inactivating mutations and loss-of-heterozygosity in renal cell carcinomas. Herein, we sought to examine whether VHL DNA is subject to differential methylation, and if so, whether it is altered in early-onset PE (E-PE). Sodium bisulfite modification and methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed that VHL is subject to extensive methylation in a CpG-rich region within its promoter in the human placenta. Notably, we detected significant differences in methylation in E-PE placentae relative to normotensive age-matched controls at key transcription factor binding sites, including that of the transcriptional repressor E2F4. Treatment of JEG3 cells with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, revealed that loss of DNA methylation promoted VHL transcription by attenuating VHL association with E2F4. RNAi knockdown of E2F4 in vitro confirmed its function on VHL repression. Exposure of JEG3 cells to transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) downregulated VHL mRNA. In line with elevated levels of TGFbeta3 in E-PE, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that E2F4-VHL association was enhanced upon TGFbeta3 treatment, indicative of VHL transcriptional inhibition. In line with decreased VHL expression in E-PE, augmented E2F4-VHL association was also observed in E-PE placental tissue relative to controls. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that hypomethylation of VHL DNA at a key transcription factor binding site has significant consequences for its transcriptional repression in early-onset preeclampsia.", "author_address": "Alahari, Sruthi.

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of pazopanib in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. METHODS: In this non-randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, adult patients with clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease were recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and were treated with pazopanib (800 mg orally daily) for 24 weeks, with an option to continue treatment if desired by the patient and treating physician. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response and safety in the per-protocol population. The objective response was measured for each patient and each lesion type. Radiographic assessments were done at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout the study. Activity and safety were assessed with continuous monitoring and a Bayesian design. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01436227, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012, and Aug 10, 2016, we screened 37 patients with genetically confirmed or clinical features consistent with von Hippel-Lindau disease, of whom 31 eligible patients were treated with pazopanib. The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 42% (13 of 31 patients). By lesion sites responses were observed in 31 (52%) of 59 renal cell carcinomas, nine (53%) of 17 pancreatic lesions, and two (4%) of 49 CNS haemangioblastomas. Seven (23%) of 31 patients chose to stay on the treatment after 24 weeks. Four (13%) of 31 patients withdrew from the study because of grade 3 or 4 transaminitis, and three (10%) discontinued study treatment because of treatment intolerance with multiple intercurrent grade 1-2 toxicities. Treatment-related serious adverse events included one case each of appendicitis and gastritis and one patient had a fatal CNS bleed. INTERPRETATION: Pazopanib was associated with encouraging preliminary activity in von Hippel-Lindau disease, with a side-effect profile consistent with that seen in previous trials. Pazopanib could be considered as a treatment choice for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and growing lesions, or to reduce the size of unresectable lesions in these patients. The safety and activity of pazopanib in this setting warrants further investigation. FUNDING: Novartis Inc and NIH National Cancer Institute core grant.", "author_address": "Jonasch, Eric.

We analyzed whole genomes from 95 biopsies across 33 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We find hotspots of point mutations in the 5' UTR of TERT, targeting a MYC-MAX-MAD1 repressor associated with telomere lengthening. The most common structural abnormality generates simultaneous 3p loss and 5q gain (36% patients), typically through chromothripsis. This event occurs in childhood or adolescence, generally as the initiating event that precedes emergence of the tumor's most recent common ancestor by years to decades. Similar genomic changes drive inherited ccRCC. Modeling differences in age incidence between inherited and sporadic cancers suggests that the number of cells with 3p loss capable of initiating sporadic tumors is no more than a few hundred.

Thus, investigating regulators of mitochondrial function is of particular interest. Previous work has shown that the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory chain function. pVHL is best known as an E3-ubiquitin ligase for the alpha-subunit of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) family of dimeric transcription factors. In normoxia, pVHL recognizes and binds hydroxylated HIF-alpha (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), targeting it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In this way, HIF transcriptional activity is tightly controlled at the level of HIF-alpha protein stability. At least 80% of clear cell renal carcinomas exhibit inactivation of the VHL gene, which leads to HIF-alpha protein stabilization and constitutive HIF activation. Constitutive HIF activation in renal carcinoma drives tumor progression and metastasis. Reconstitution of wild-type VHL protein (pVHL) in pVHL-defective renal carcinoma cells not only suppresses HIF activation and tumor growth, but also enhances mitochondrial respiratory chain function via mechanisms that are not fully elucidated. Here, we show that pVHL regulates mitochondrial function when re-expressed in pVHL-defective 786O and RCC10 renal carcinoma cells distinct from its regulation of HIF-alpha. Expression of CHCHD4, a key component of the disulphide relay system (DRS) involved in mitochondrial protein import within the intermembrane space (IMS) was elevated by pVHL re-expression alongside enhanced expression of respiratory chain subunits of complex I (NDUFB10) and complex IV (mtCO-2 and COX IV). These changes correlated with increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and dynamic changes in glucose and glutamine metabolism. Knockdown of HIF-2alpha also led to increased OCR, and elevated expression of CHCHD4, NDUFB10, and COXIV in 786O cells. Expression of pVHL mutant proteins (R200W, N78S, D126N, and S183L) that constitutively stabilize HIF-alpha but differentially promote glycolytic metabolism, were also found to differentially promote the pVHL-mediated mitochondrial phenotype. Parallel changes in mitochondrial morphology and the mitochondrial network were observed. Our study reveals a new role for pVHL in regulating CHCHD4 and mitochondrial function in renal carcinoma cells.", "author_address": "Briston, Thomas.

The pathogenesis of VHL loss is currently best understood to occur through stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factors, activation of hypoxia-induced signaling pathways, and transcriptional reprogramming towards a pro-angiogenic and pro-growth state. However, hypoxia also drives other pro-tumorigenic processes, including the development of genomic instability via down-regulation of DNA repair gene expression. Here, we find that DNA repair genes involved in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (HR) and in mismatch repair, which are down-regulated by hypoxic stress, are decreased in VHL-deficient renal cancer cells relative to wild type VHL-complemented cells. Functionally, this gene repression is associated with impaired DNA double-strand break repair in VHL-deficient cells, as determined by the persistence of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and reduced repair activity in a homology-dependent plasmid reactivation assay. Furthermore, VHL deficiency conferred increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, analogous to the synthetic lethality observed between hypoxia and these agents. Finally, we discovered a correlation between VHL inactivation and reduced HR gene expression in a large panel of human renal carcinoma samples. Together, our data elucidate a novel connection between VHL-deficient renal carcinoma and hypoxia-induced down-regulation of DNA repair, and identify potential opportunities for targeting DNA repair defects in human renal cell carcinoma.", "author_address": "Scanlon, Susan E.

A total of 3 cases of VHL syndrome treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College (Zunyi, China) between September 2014 and October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The associated literature was reviewed, and the diagnostic and therapeutic features were discussed. Case 1 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by a renal tumor on the right side, and radical tumor resection in the right kidney was performed. Postoperative pathological examination indicated clear cell carcinoma. Case 2 was diagnosed as VHL syndrome accompanied by bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma. The left-side adrenal tumor was removed, and postoperative pathological analysis was suggestive of adrenal pheochromocytoma. Case 3 visited the hospital due to the presence of masses on the left and right sides of the kidney, but did not undergo surgery for personal reasons. Follow-ups were scheduled subsequent to surgery at another hospital. The diagnosis in all 3 cases was confirmed by genetic testing, where VHL mutations were detected in all patients. Following surgery, pedigree and genetic analysis was performed in all 3 pedigrees and VHL mutations were identified in 7 family members. The diagnosis of VHL syndrome should be based on the clinical manifestation of the patients and the results of genetic tests. DNA analysis of mutations is the main method for diagnosis. An appropriate surgical plan should be formulated based on the site, size and number of tumors, and the condition of the patient. Since VHL syndrome is an inheritable genetic disorder and relapse following surgery is common, pedigree analysis of the patient and lifelong follow-ups are essential. Additionally, physicians should pay attention to VHL syndrome in order to avoid missing diagnosis or misdiagnosis.", "author_address": "Wang, Yuanliang.

In the present study, the potential involvement of miRNA-3613-3p in the cell biology of neuroblastoma was investigated. It was identified that the expression of miRNA-3613-3p varies among a range of human neuroblastoma cell lines.

A greater knowledge of the genetics of inherited RCC has the potential to translate into novel therapeutic targets for sporadic RCC. METHODS: A literature review was performed summarising the current knowledge on hereditary RCC diagnosis, surveillance and management. RESULTS: Familial RCC is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although inherited RCC may present without a relevant family history. A number of familial RCC syndromes have been identified. Familial non-syndromic RCC is suspected when >= 2 relatives are affected in the absence of syndromic features, although clear diagnostic criteria are lacking. Young age at onset and bilateral/multicentric tumours are recognised characteristics which should prompt molecular genetic analysis. Surveillance in individuals at risk of inherited RCC aims to prevent morbidity and mortality via early detection of tumours. Though screening and management guidelines for some inherited RCC syndromes (e.g. von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, hereditary leiomyomatosis) are well defined for rare cause of inherited RCC (e.g. germline BAP1 mutations), there is limited information regarding the lifetime RCC risks and the most appropriate screening modalities. CONCLUSION: Increasing knowledge of the natural history and genetic basis has led to characterisation and tailored management of hereditary RCC syndromes. International data sharing of inherited RCC gene variant information may enable evidence-based improvements in the diagnosis, surveillance protocols and management of these rare conditions.", "author_address": "Maher, Eamonn R.

While pheochromocytomas are often non-malignant, the resulting changes in cellular physiology are coupled to de-regulated production of catecholamines, which in turn disrupt circadian blood pressure variation and therefore circadian entrainment of other tissues. In this review we thoroughly discuss the molecular and physiological interplay between hypoxia signaling and the circadian clock in pheochromocytoma, and how this underlies endocrine disruption leading to loss of circadian blood pressure variation in the affected patients.

While HIF1alpha can act as a ccRCC tumor suppressor, HIF2alpha has emerged as the key HIF isoform that is essential for ccRCC tumor progression.

Previous studies of VHL disease have documented several genotype-phenotype correlations; however, many such correlations are still unknown. Increased identification of new mutations and patients with previously described mutations will allow us to better understand how VHL mutations influence disease phenotypes. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A total of 45 individuals from five unrelated families were evaluated, of which 21 patients were either diagnosed with VHL disease or showed strong evidence related to this disease. We compared the patients' gene sequencing results with their medical records including CT or MRI scans, eye examinations and laboratory/pathological examinations. Patients were also interviewed to obtain information regarding their family history. RESULTS: We identified four missense mutations: c.239G>T (p.Ser80Ile), linked with VHL Type 2B, was associated with renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and hemangioma in the cerebellum; c.232A>T (p.Asn78Tyr) manifested as RCC alone and likely caused VHL Type 1; c.500G>A (p.Arg167Gln) mutation was more likely to cause VHL Type 2 than Type 1 as it preferentially induced Pheo and HB in the retina, cerebellum and spinal cord; c.293A>G (p.Try98Cys) was associated with Pheo and thus likely induced VHL Type 2. CONCLUSIONS: Characterizing VHL disease genotype-phenotype correlations can enhance the ability to predict the risk of individual patients developing different VHL-related phenotypes. Ultimately, such insight will improve the diagnostics, surveillance and treatment of VHL patients. PRECIS: Four missense mutations in VHL have been identified in 21 individuals when five unrelated Chinese families with VHL disease were analyzed; VHL mutations are highly associated with unique disease phenotypes.", "author_address": "Liu, Qiuli.

In vitro and in vivo data indicated that Vhl-deficient osteoblasts displayed massively increased glucose uptake and glycolysis associated with upregulated HIF-target gene expression, resembling the Warburg effect that typifies cancer cells. Overall, the glucose consumption by the skeleton was increased in the mutant mice, as revealed by 18F-FDG radioactive tracer experiments. Moreover, the glycemia levels correlated inversely with the level of skeletal glucose uptake, and pharmacological treatment with the glycolysis inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA), which restored glucose metabolism in Vhl-deficient osteogenic cells in vitro, prevented the development of the systemic metabolic phenotype in the mutant mice.

Pathological vessel remodeling arises from misregulation of HIFs and VEGF, among other genes. Variation in disease penetrance has long been recognized in relation to genotype. We show Vhl mutations also disrupt Notch signaling, causing mutation-specific vascular abnormalities, e.g., type 1 (null) vs. type 2B (murine G518A representing human R167Q). In conditional mutation retina vasculature, Vhl-null mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/fl) had little effect on initial vessel branching, but it severely reduced arterial and venous branching at later stages. Interestingly, this mutation accelerated arterial maturation, as observed in retina vessel morphology and aberrant alpha-smooth muscle actin localization, particularly in vascular pericytes. RNA sequencing analysis identified gene expression changes within several key pathways, including Notch and smooth muscle cell contractility. Notch inhibition failed to reverse later-stage branching defects but rescued the accelerated arterialization. Retinal vessels harboring the type 2B Vhl mutation (i.e., UBCCreER/+Vhlfl/2B) displayed stage-specific changes in vessel branching and an advanced progression toward an arterial phenotype. Disrupting Notch signaling in type 2B mutants increased both artery and vein branching and restored arterial maturation toward nonmutant levels. By revealing differential effects of the null and type 2B Vhl mutations on vessel branching and maturation, these data may provide insight into the variability of VHL-associated vascular changes - particularly the heterogeneity and aggressiveness in ccRCC vessel growth - and also suggest Notch pathway targets for treating VHL syndrome.", "author_address": "Arreola, Alexandra.

The objective of this study was to investigate HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, as potential therapeutics for CC-RCC. Importantly, treatment with statins was found to be synthetically lethal with the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which occurs in 90% of CC-RCC driving the disease. This effect has been confirmed in three different CC-RCC cell lines with three different lipophilic statins. Inhibition of mevalonate synthesis by statins causes a profound cytostatic effect at nanomolar concentrations and becomes cytotoxic at low micromolar concentrations in VHL-deficient CC-RCC. The synthetic lethal effect can be fully rescued by both mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not by squalene, indicating that the effect is due to disruption of small GTPase isoprenylation and not the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of Rho and Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling contributes to the synthetic lethality effect, and overactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor signaling resulting from VHL loss is required. Finally, statin treatment is able to inhibit both tumor initiation and progression of subcutaneous 786-OT1-based CC-RCC tumors in mice. Thus, statins represent potential therapeutics for the treatment of VHL-deficient CC-RCC. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(8); 1781-92. \u00c2\u00a92018 AACR.", "author_address": "Thompson, Jordan M.

It is a relatively vulnerable position, and in most cases surgical treatment is required upon rupture. The reconstructed enthesis is usually weaker compared to the original, and is prone to rupture again. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) is known to be involved in extensive activities in cells. It is inhibited under normoxic conditions, and undergoes two essential processes, hydroxylation and ubiquitination, the latter of which has been largely unexplored. Herein, we measured the levels of HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha in VH298-treated rat tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) by immunoblotting. We also detected the proliferation of TDSCs using CCK-8 assay and the mRNA levels of related genes by quantitative RT-PCR. The TDSCs were observed to be induced and the chondrogenic differentiation related genes were found to be enhanced. We also simulated in-vitro wounding in a scratch test and reconstructed the enthesis in a rat model of Achilles tendon by classical surgery followed by administration of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection or VH298 injection. We observed that HIF-1alpha and hydroxy-HIF-1alpha levels were increased in VH298-treated TDSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Thirty micromolar VH298 could significantly increase cell proliferation, migration, and expression of collagen-1alpha, collagen-3alpha, decorin, tenomodulin, tenascin C genes, and chondrogenic differentiation-related genes, collagen-2alpha, SRY-box9, aggrecan. VH298-treated enthesis could tolerate more load-to-failure, had a better healing pattern, and activation of HIF signaling pathway. VH298 can thus enhance the functional activities of TDSCs, enhance their chondrogenic differentiation potential, and accelerate enthesis healing by inhibiting the ubiquitination of hydroxy-HIF-1alpha.", "author_address": "Qiu, Shuo.

However, the role of glycolysis induced by arsenite, a well-established human carcinogen, is unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as regulators in various cancers, but how lncRNAs regulate glucose metabolism remains largely unexplored. We have found that, in human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells, arsenite increases lactate production; glucose consumption; and expression of glycolysis-related genes, including HK-2, Eno-1, and Glut-4. In L-02 cells exposed to arsenite, the lncRNA, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs)-alpha, the transcriptional regulators of cellular response to hypoxia, are over-expressed. In addition, HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha, is involved in arsenite-induced glycolysis, and MALAT1 enhances arsenite-induced glycolysis. Although MALAT1 regulates HIF-alpha and promotes arsenite-induced glycolysis, MALAT1 promotes glycolysis through HIF-1alpha, not HIF-2alpha. Moreover, arsenite-increased MALAT1 enhances the disassociation of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor from HIF-1alpha, alleviating VHL-mediated ubiquitination of HIF-1alpha, which causes accumulation of HIF-1alpha. In sum, these findings indicate that MALAT1, acting through HIF-1alpha stabilization, is a mediator that enhances glycolysis induced by arsenite. These results provide a link between the induction of lncRNAs and the glycolysis in cells exposed to arsenite, and thus establish a previously unknown mechanism for arsenite-induced hepatotoxicity.", "author_address": "Luo, Fei.

Multiple studies have demonstrated significant perturbations in DNA methylation in ccRCC via largely unclear mechanisms that modify the transcriptional output of tumour cells. Here, we show that the methylation status of the CpG dinucleotide within the consensus hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) markedly influences the binding of HIF and that the loss of VHL results in significant alterations in the DNA methylome. Surprisingly, hypoxia, which likewise promotes HIF stabilisation and activation, has relatively few effects on global DNA methylation. Gene expression analysis of ccRCC patient samples highlighted expression of a group of genes whose transcription correlated with methylation changes, including hypoxic responsive genes such as VEGF and TGF. These results suggest that the loss of VHL alters DNA methylation profile across the genome, commonly associated with and contributing to ccRCC progression.", "author_address": "Robinson, Claire M.

The HIF-independent functions of pVHL also serve an important role in its tumor-suppressor action. In the present study, the association between pVHL and NEK8 was demonstrated in the human gastric cancer cell line, SGC-7901, indicating a direct interaction of pVHL with NEK8. Subsequently, it was reported that MG-132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, may attenuate pVHL overexpression-induced reductions in NEK8 protein expression levels. In addition, the present study revealed that pVHL may stimulate the rapid degradation of NEK8 protein and promote its ubiquitination. The association between the expression profile of NEK8 and the survival status of patients with gastric cancer was analyzed from an online database. Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicated that higher expression levels of NEK8 may lead to poor survival, as suggested by the transcriptomic data of 1,065 patients with gastric cancer. It was found that NEK8-knockdown mediated by RNA interference inhibited SGC-7901 and SNU-1 proliferation, colony formation and migration in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, the present study proposed that NEK8 may be a novel target of pVHL as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and may serve a role as a potential oncoprotein in human gastric cancer.", "author_address": "Ding, Xiao-Fei.

Recent studies incorporated biological markers into this question and some studies showed that expression of S100P, IMP3, and maspin as well as nonexpression of von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) were significantly correlated with PDAC. In this study, we aimed to investigate diagnostic value of maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL immunostaining in fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of pancreatic lesions. Materials and Method: In all, 33 cases of FNAB cell blocks of PDAC and 34 cases of surgical non-neoplastic pancreas specimens which were retrieved from the archives slides from 2007 to 2011 were included in this study. All the cases were stained with maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL. Expression patterns of markers were scored and compared with benign mimickers. Test performance of each antibody and possible antibody combinations were also evaluated. Results: The study was composed of 33 PDAC and 34 control cases (8 chronic pancreatitis, 3 mucinous cystic neoplasm, and 23 nontumoral pancreatic tissue of PDAC). Diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy in S100P, IMP3, and maspin was 84.8%, 81.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. Specificity of these three markers was 100%. Sensitivity and specificity of pVHL for detecting nontumoral pancreatic tissue were 100% and 81.8%, respectively. When maspin, IMP3, and S100P expression were used together as triple test, sensitivity was 62.5% and specificity 100%. However, when any two of each three markers were evaluated (triple test/dual response), sensitivity reached 93.8% and specificity 100%. Conclusion: We observed that dual response in triple test (positive staining with two of these three markers) of maspin, IMP3, and S100P immunocytochemistry is very sensitive and specific in differential diagnosis of PDA and non-neoplastic pancreatic lesions. pVHL may have an additional role, when triple assessment is not satisfactory.", "author_address": "Aksoy-Altinboga, Aysegul.

The immunohistochemistry evaluation of these papillary-cystic neoplasms frequently raises the differential diagnosis with renal cell carcinoma, among other metastatic neoplasms, whether in VHL patients or not. A cohort of 26 patients with ELSTs were evaluated for histologic features, immunohistochemistry findings, and association with VHL. Standard immunohistochemistry evaluation was performed. Sixteen females and 10 males ranging in age from 10 to 69 years (mean 44; VHL mean: 32) at initial presentation, comprised the cohort of patients. Most (86%) experienced hearing changes or inner ear symptoms (vertigo, dizziness), with an average duration of symptoms for 39 months (range 2-240 months). The tumors were an average of 2.9 cm (range 0.4-8 cm), with 14 left, 11 right sided and one bilateral tumor. Nine patients had documented VHL, with 3 patients having a concurrent or subsequent clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Patients were followed an average of 6.2 years (available in 24 patients): 19 alive without disease, 7.5 years; 2 dead without disease, 1.2 years; and 3 alive with disease, 3.1 years. The neoplastic cells show the following immunohistochemistry findings: AE1/AE3, EMA, CK7, CAIX, GLUT1, VEGF: 100% of cases tested were positive; pax-8: 85% of cases positive; CD10 and RCC: 0% of cases reactive. Based on this cohort of 26 patients with ELST, 9 of whom had VHL, the strong pax-8 and CAIX should be used in conjunction with negative CD10 and RCC to help exclude a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. As CAIX is an enzyme overexpressed in hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factor is what VHL protein regulates, this is an expected, although previously unreported finding.

The new disposable Moray micro forceps biopsy (MFB) device allows tissue sampling from the pancreatic cyst wall/septum and aims to improve diagnosis. This study compares the diagnostic performance of the MFB with the current conventional analysis of pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF). METHODS: A total of 48 patients sampled with MFB were identified. Cysts were classified as mucinous on PCF based on extracellular mucin/mucinous epithelium, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels >=192 ng/mL, or KRAS/GNAS mutation. A diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm was supported by GNAS mutation; a diagnosis of serous cystadenoma was supported by Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mutation. A diagnosis of mucinous cystic neoplasm required the presence of subepithelial ovarian-type stroma. A high-risk cyst was defined as a mucinous cyst with high-grade dysplasia or an adenocarcinoma. Comparisons in diagnostic performance between PCF and MFB were made. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 69.6 years (range, 27-90 years); 25 of 48 patients (52.1%) were female. Cysts were in the pancreatic head (13 patients), neck (2 patients), body (20 patients), and tail (13 patients), averaging 3.1 cm (range, 1.2-6.0 cm). There was concordance with mucinous versus nonmucinous classification (60.4% for PCF vs 58.3% for MFB; P = .949). Three high-risk cysts were detected by PCF and 2 were detected by MFB (P = .670). However, MFB diagnosed significantly more specific cysts compared with PCF (50.0% for MFB vs 18.8% for PCF; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: PCF analysis and MFB have comparable performance in distinguishing between mucinous and nonmucinous cysts and for detecting high-risk cysts. However, MFB was found to be superior for diagnosing specific cyst subtypes, thus adding significant value to preoperative patient management.

Although miR-21-5p upregulation has been demonstrated to associate with tumorigenesis by controlling the expression of oncogenic and tumor suppressor genes, only a small number of studies have investigated the expression of miR-21-5p and its functional role in CC. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of miR-21-5p on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of CC cells, and the potential underlying molecular mechanism of these effects. The measurement of miR-21-5p levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that miR-21-5p was markedly increased in CC cell lines compared with normal cells. Upon silencing of miR-21-5p, a marked suppression of the proliferation, migration and invasion of CaSki cells was observed, with induction of cell apoptosis. These effects were reversed with miR-21-5p overexpression. A database search followed by a luciferase reporter assay ascertained that the 3'-untranslated region of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) mRNA sequence was a direct target of miR-21-5p. Furthermore, silencing of VHL neutralized the effects of miR-21-5p inhibition. These observations suggested that miR-21-5p is an oncogene that is able to promote the metastatic phenotype of CC cells through downregulation of VHL expression, which may present a path to novel therapeutic stratagems for the CC therapy.", "author_address": "Cai, Lina.

We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the association between VHL alteration and clinopathologic findings in ccRCCs. We performed a systematic computerized search of online databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (up to July 2018). From ten studies, 1,082 patients were included in the pooled analyses of odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pathological features (nuclear grade and disease stage) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for overall survival (OS). VHL alteration was not significantly associated with nuclear grade (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.59-1.06, p = 0.12) or disease stage (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.79-1.46, p = 0.65). There was also no significant correlation between VHL alteration and OS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.43-1.29, p = 0.30).

It is not completely understood what underlies the development of renal pathology, and the use of murine Vhl models has been challenging due to limitations in disease conservation. We previously described a zebrafish model bearing inactivating mutations in the orthologue of the human VHL gene. METHODS: We used histopathological and functional assays to investigate the pronephric and glomerular developmental defects in vhl mutant zebrafish, supported by human cell culture assays. RESULTS: Here, we report that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity in zebrafish embryos. vhl mutant glomeruli are enlarged, cxcr4a+ capillary loops are dilated and the Bowman space is widened. While we did not observe pronephric cysts, the cells of the proximal convoluted and anterior proximal straight tubule are enlarged, periodic acid schiff (PAS) and Oil Red O positive, and display a clear cytoplasm after hematoxylin and eosine staining. Ultrastructural analysis showed the vhl-/- tubule to accumulate large numbers of vesicles of variable size and electron density. Microinjection of the endocytic fluorescent marker AM1-43 in zebrafish embryos revealed an accumulation of endocytic vesicles in the vhl mutant pronephric tubule, which we can recapitulate in human cells lacking VHL. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that vhl is required to maintain pronephric tubule and glomerulus integrity during zebrafish development, and suggests a role for VHL in endocytic vesicle trafficking.", "author_address": "van Rooijen, Ellen.

Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is involved in determining oxygen metabolism and mitochondria function, we investigated the involvement of HIF-1 activity in lidocaine-induced cell death. We investigated the role of HIF activation on lidocaine-induced caspase activation and cell death in renal cell-derived RCC4 cells lacking functional von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein. We demonstrate that HIF-1 suppressed oxygen consumption and facilitated glycolysis in a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1-dependent manner and that activation of HIF-1 conferred resistance to lidocaine-induced cell death. We also demonstrated that exogenous HIF-1 activation, through HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibition or exposure to hypoxic conditions, alleviates lidocaine toxicity by suppressing mitochondria function and generating ROS, not only in RCC4 cells, but also in the neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HIF-1 activation due to VHL deletion, treatment with small molecule HIFalpha-hydroxylase inhibitors, and exposure to hypoxic conditions suppresses mitochondrial respiratory chain function and confers resistance to lidocaine toxicity.", "author_address": "Okamoto, Akihisa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two VHL patients (19 male) were selected from a prospectively maintained imaging database for patients that underwent surgical tumor resection between 2014 and 2016. One hundred and eleven VHL lesions were marked for resection and pathology analysis. Whole lesion volumetric segmentation was performed on nephrographic phase of the two most recent contrast-enhanced CT scans before surgery. Intensity distribution curves were obtained from segmentations. A linear mixed model, accounting for within-patient correlations, was used to compare the growth and enhancement differences between different germline pathogenic variant types. RESULTS: There was no significant difference for the lesions' total growth between different germline pathogenic variants (P value = 0.78). The median growth rate for all lesions was 1.7 cc/year (IQR 0.5, 3.9) with a baseline median size of 4.1 cm<sup>3</sup> (IQR 1.7, 11.7). In complex lesions, the solid portion of the tumor demonstrated a higher growth rate (1.6 cc/year) than cystic portions (0.02 cc/year) which stayed relatively unchanged. Only one pathogenic variant (Splice donor) showed some levels of difference in its relative enhancement from other subtypes. CONCLUSION: The type of germline pathogenic variant on the VHL gene does not affect the growth rate or CT enhancement values of renal lesions in patients with VHL. The absolute growth rate of these tumors may be used in the scheduling of follow-up studies.", "author_address": "Farhadi, Faraz.

Since this discovery, additional VHL mutations have been identified in patients with congenital erythrocytosis, in a homozygous or compound-heterozygous state. VHL is a major tumor suppressor gene, mutations in which were first described in patients presenting with VHL disease, which is characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors. Here, we identify a new VHL cryptic exon (termed E1') deep in intron 1 that is naturally expressed in many tissues. More importantly, we identify mutations in E1' in 7 families with erythrocytosis (1 homozygous case and 6 compound-heterozygous cases with a mutation in E1' in addition to a mutation in VHL coding sequences) and in 1 large family with typical VHL disease but without any alteration in the other VHL exons. In this study, we show that the mutations induced a dysregulation of VHL splicing with excessive retention of E1' and were associated with a downregulation of VHL protein expression. In addition, we demonstrate a pathogenic role for synonymous mutations in VHL exon 2 that altered splicing through E2-skipping in 5 families with erythrocytosis or VHL disease. In all the studied cases, the mutations differentially affected splicing, correlating with phenotype severity. This study demonstrates that cryptic exon retention and exon skipping are new VHL alterations and reveals a novel complex splicing regulation of the VHL gene. These findings open new avenues for diagnosis and research regarding the VHL-related hypoxia-signaling pathway.", "author_address": "Lenglet, Marion.

Management guidelines for VHL-PanNETs continue to be based on limited evidence, and survival data to guide surgical management are lacking. We established the European-American-Asian-VHL-PanNET-Registry to assess data for risks for metastases, survival and long-term outcomes to provide best management recommendations. Of 2330 VHL patients, 273 had a total of 484 PanNETs. Median age at diagnosis of PanNET was 35 years (range 10-75). Fifty-five (20%) patients had metastatic PanNETs. Metastatic PanNETs were significantly larger (median size 5 vs 2 cm; P < 0.001) and tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was faster (22 vs 126 months; P = 0.001). All metastatic tumors were >=2.8 cm. Codons 161 and 167 were hotspots for VHL germline mutations with enhanced risk for metastatic PanNETs. Multivariate prediction modeling disclosed maximum tumor diameter and TVDT as significant predictors for metastatic disease (positive and negative predictive values of 51% and 100% for diameter cut-off >=2.8 cm, 44% and 91% for TVDT cut-off of <=24 months). In 117 of 273 patients, PanNETs >1.5 cm in diameter were operated. Ten-year survival was significantly longer in operated vs non-operated patients, in particular for PanNETs <2.8 cm vs >=2.8 cm (94% vs 85% by 10 years; P = 0.020; 80% vs 50% at 10 years; P = 0.030). This study demonstrates that patients with PanNET approaching the cut-off diameter of 2.8 cm should be operated. Mutations in exon 3, especially of codons 161/167 are at enhanced risk for metastatic PanNETs. Survival is significantly longer in operated non-metastatic VHL-PanNETs.", "author_address": "Krauss, Tobias.

In this study, we performed integrated proteomic and transcriptomic screening in all four tumour-node-metastasis stages of ccRCC and adjacent normal tissues (n = 18) to investigate differentially expressed genes. Most identified differentially expressed genes revealed a strong association with transforming growth factor-beta level and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process. Of them, Serpin peptidase inhibitor clade H member 1 (SERPINH1) revealed the strongest association with poor prognosis and regulation on the expression levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers. Subsequently, two independent sets (n = 532 and 105) verified the high level of SERPINH1 in ccRCC tissues and its association with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival in all tumour-node-metastasis stages and patients with von Hippel-Lindau wild-type (VHL-WT). SERPINH1 was an independent predictor of poor overall survival (hazard ratio 0.696 for all patients) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.433 for all patients and 0.362 for patients with VHL-WT) in ccRCC. We have thus shown for the first time that SERPINH1 is an independent precision predictor for unfavourable prognosis in ccRCC.

Currently, local therapeutic options include nephron-sparing surgery and alternative ablative procedures. For advanced metastatic disease, systemic treatment, including inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor pathways and mTOR pathways, as well as immunotherapy are available. Multimodal therapy, targeting multiple signaling pathways and/or enhancing the immune response, is currently being investigated.

Although genotype-phenotype correlation has been described in many studies, the risk factors for VHL survival remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate the median survival of Chinese patients with VHL disease and explore whether VHL survival is influenced by genetic and clinical factors. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited 340 patients from 127 VHL families. Kaplan-Meier plot and Cox regression model were used to evaluate the median survival and assess how survival was influenced by birth year, birth order, sex, family history, mutation type, onset age and first presenting symptom. RESULTS: The estimated median life expectancy for Chinese patients with VHL disease was 62 years. Patients with early-onset age, positive family history and truncating mutation types had poorer overall and VHL-related survival. Patients with haemangioblastoma as their first presenting symptom were related to a higher risk of death from central nervous system haemangioblastoma than those with abdominal lesions (HR 8.84, 95% CI 2.04 to 38.37, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: This largest VHL survival analysis indicates that onset age, family history, mutation type and first presenting symptom have an effect on the survival of patients with VHL disease, which is helpful to genetic counselling and clinical decision-making.", "author_address": "Wang, Jiang-Yi.

We investigated the potential of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VHL as biomarkers in metastatic ccRCC (m-ccRCC) patients treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 3 VHL SNPs in 199 m-ccRCC patients: rs1642742 T > C, rs1642743 A > G, and rs1678607 C > A. Primary end points were response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) after start of first-line TKI. RR was compared with Fisher's exact test, and PFS and OS with Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression. Secondary end points were association with VHL promotor hypermethylation, VHL mutation status, VHL loss of heterozygosity, >= 25% sarcomatoid dedifferentiation, and expression of genes implicated in angiogenesis and immunoresponse (Fisher's exact test and unpaired t tests). RESULTS: The minor alleles of rs1642742 and rs1642743, known to be in close linkage disequilibrium, were associated with poor outcome, following a recessive pattern. For the rs1642742 CC versus TT/TC genotype, OS was 11 versus 26 months (hazard ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.6; P = .015). For the rs1642743 GG versus AA/AG genotype, OS was 15 versus 28 months (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.0; P = .004). After multivariable analysis, both remained linked with poor OS (P = .018 and P = .009, respectively). There was a trend toward shorter PFS and poorer RR. Both SNPs were associated with >= 25% sarcomatoid dedifferentiation (P = .037 and .006, respectively). No significant results were found for rs1678607. CONCLUSION: rs1642742 and rs1642743 are candidate biomarkers for poor OS in m-ccRCC patients receiving first-line VEGFR-TKI. They are associated with higher levels of sarcomatoid dedifferentiation.", "author_address": "Verbiest, Annelies.

We aimed to construct a more valuable genotype-phenotype correlation based on alterations in VHL protein (pVHL). METHODS: VHL patients (n = 339) were recruited and grouped based on mutation types: HIF-alpha binding site missense (HM) mutations, non-HIF-alpha binding site missense (nHM) mutations, and truncating (TR) mutations. Age-related risks of VHL-associated tumors and patient survival were compared. RESULTS: Missense mutations conferred an increased risk of pheochromocytoma (HR = 1.854, p = 0.047) compared with truncating mutations. The risk of pheochromocytoma was lower in the HM group than in the nHM group (HR = 0.298, p = 0.003) but was similar between HM and TR groups (HR = 0.901, p = 0.810). Patients in the nHM group had a higher risk of pheochromocytoma (HR = 3.447, p < 0.001) and lower risks of central nervous system hemangioblastoma (CHB) (HR = 0.700, p = 0.045), renal cell carcinoma (HR = 0.610, p = 0.024), and pancreatic tumor (HR = 0.382, p < 0.001) than those in the combined HM and TR (HMTR) group. Moreover, nHM mutations were independently associated with better overall survival (HR = 0.345, p = 0.005) and CHB-specific survival (HR = 0.129, p = 0.005) than HMTR mutations. CONCLUSION: The modified genotype-phenotype correlation links VHL gene mutation, substrate binding site, and phenotypic diversity (penetrance and survival), and provides more accurate information for genetic counseling and pathogenesis studies.", "author_address": "Liu, Sheng-Jie.

By contrast, epigenetic aberrations are commonly found in RCC, indicating that epigenetic reprogramming is an important event in RCC development. Epigenetic alterations comprise several different aberrations, such as changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNA levels, and occur in the most important signalling pathways in RCC, such as the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor (VHL)-hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, the WNT-beta-catenin pathway, and pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Owing to their involvement in these pathways and frequent occurrence in RCC, epigenetic alterations are regarded as potential biomarkers for the early detection of disease and for prediction of prognosis and treatment response. In addition, most of these alterations are potentially reversible, so they also provide new targets for therapy. At the moment, epigenetic biomarkers for RCC are not being used in clinical practice, but targeted epigenetic therapies are under investigation. Understanding the extent of epigenetic changes occurring in RCC and the mechanisms by which they influence disease progression and treatment response, as well as knowledge of current research on biomarkers and treatments, is crucial to successful clinical translation of epigenetics in RCC.", "author_address": "Joosten, Sophie C.

Affected patients are carriers of a germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Somatic mutations of this gene are also found in sporadic ccRCC and numerous pan-genomic studies have reported a dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in these sporadic tumors. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of VHL-associated ccRCC, particularly in the context of multiple tumors, the present study characterized the mRNA and miRNA transcriptome through an integrative analysis compared with sporadic renal tumors. In the present study, two series of ccRCC samples were used. The first set consisted of several samples from different tumors occurring in the same patient, for two independent patients affected with VHL disease. The second set consisted of 12 VHL-associated tumors and 22 sporadic ccRCC tumors compared with a pool of normal renal tissue. For each sample series, an expression analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs was conducted using microarrays. The results indicated that multiple tumors within the kidney of a patient with VHL disease featured a similar pattern of miRNA and gene expression. In addition, the expression levels of miRNA were able to distinguish VHL-associated tumors from sporadic ccRCC, and it was identified that 103 miRNAs and 2,474 genes were differentially expressed in the ccRCC series compared with in normal renal tissue. The majority of dysregulated genes were implicated in 'immunity' and 'metabolism' pathways. Taken together, these results allow a better understanding of the occurrence of ccRCC in patients with VHL disease, by providing insights into dysregulated miRNA and mRNA. In the set of patients with VHL disease, there were few differences in miRNA and mRNA expression, thus indicating a similar molecular evolution of these synchronous tumors and suggesting that the same molecular mechanisms underlie the pathogenesis of these hereditary tumors.", "author_address": "Gattolliat, Charles-Henry.

In the present study, our hypothesis was that BNIP3, a gene positioned downstream of HIF, would be expressed at a higher level in ccRCC; however, instead, lower levels of BNIP3 expression were identified in RCC tumor tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. These changes were associated with lower levels of VHL, and higher levels of HIF and vascular endothelial growth factor. BNIP3 was also undetectable in three investigated RCC cell lines (786-O, ACHN, A498) and GRC-1-1 cells. Methylation of the BNIP3 promoter was not detected, and neither did treatment with a methylation inhibitor cause cell proliferation. However, treatment with a histone deacetylation inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), inhibited cultured RCC cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis and restored BNIP3 expression. Furthermore, histone deacetylation of the BNIP3 promoter was identified in ACHN and 786-O cells, and the acetylation status was restored following TSA treatment. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that histone deacetylation, but not methylation, is most likely to cause BNIP3 inactivation in RCC. The data also indicated that restoration of BNIP3 expression by a histone deacetylation inhibitor led to growth inhibition and apoptotic promotion in RCC.", "author_address": "Shao, Yanxiang.

The primary treatment for metastatic RCC (mRCC) is molecular-targeted therapy, especially anti-angiogenic therapy. VEGF monoclonal antibodies and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the main drugs used in anti-angiogenic therapy. However, crosstalk between VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase or downstream pathways produce resistance to TKI treatment, and the multi-target inhibitors, HIF inhibitors or combination strategies are promising strategies for mRCC. HIFs are upstream of the crosstalk between the growth factors, and these factors may regulate the expression of VEGR, EGF, PDGF and other growth factors. The frequent VHL loss in ccRCC increases HIF expression, and HIFs may be an ideal candidate to overcome the TKI resistance. The combination of HIF inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors is also anticipated. Various clinical trials of programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors are planned.

ANK proteins are rare amongst viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, which presumably acquired them from the host via horizontal gene transfer. The architecture of poxvirus ANK proteins is, however, different from that of their cellular counterparts, and this precludes a direct acquisition event. Here we combine bioinformatics analysis and quantitative proteomics to discover a new class of viral ANK proteins with a domain organization that relates to cellular ANK proteins. These noncanonical viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, interact with host Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box resembling that of cellular Cullin-2 substrate adaptors such as the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Mutagenesis of the BC box-like sequence abrogates binding to Cullin-2, whereas fusion of this motif to an ANK-only protein confers Cullin-2 association. We demonstrated that these viral ANK/BC proteins are potent immunomodulatory proteins suppressing the activation of the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-B and interferon (IFN)-responsive factor 3 (IRF-3) and the production of cytokines and chemokines, including interferon, and that association with Cullin-2 is required for optimal inhibitory activity.

Given the existence of cellular proteins with similar architecture, viral ANK/BC proteins may be closely related to the original ANK gene acquired by an ancestral orthopoxvirus.

ANK proteins are rare amongst viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, which presumably acquired them from the host via horizontal gene transfer. The architecture of poxvirus ANK proteins is, however, different from that of their cellular counterparts, and this precludes a direct acquisition event. Here we combine bioinformatics analysis and quantitative proteomics to discover a new class of viral ANK proteins with a domain organization that relates to cellular ANK proteins.

Most of these genes were originally acquired from the host and subsequently adapted to benefit the virus. ANK proteins are common in eukaryotes but are unusual amongst viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, where they represent one of the largest protein families. We report here the existence of a new class of viral ANK proteins, termed ANK/BC, that provide new insights into the origin of poxvirus ANK proteins. ANK/BC proteins target the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-2 via a C-terminal BC box domain and are potent suppressors of the production of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon. The existence of cellular ANK proteins whose architecture is similar suggests the acquisition of a host ANK/BC gene by an ancestral orthopoxvirus and its subsequent duplication and adaptation to widen the repertoire of immune evasion strategies.", "author_address": "Odon, Valerie.

As a consequence, mild but chronic hypoxia may develop and disturb cell metabolism, function and ultimately survival, potentially contributing to retinal pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, we show that several hypoxia-inducible genes were expressed at higher levels in the aged human retina suggesting increased activity of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) during the physiological ageing process. To model chronically elevated HIF activity and investigate ensuing consequences for photoreceptors, we generated mice lacking von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein in rods. This activated HIF transcription factors and led to a slowly progressing retinal degeneration in the ageing mouse retina. Importantly, this process depended mainly on HIF1 with only a minor contribution of HIF2. A gene therapy approach using AAV-mediated RNA interference through an anti-Hif1a shRNA significantly mitigated the degeneration suggesting a potential intervention strategy that may be applicable to human patients.", "author_address": "Barben, Maya.

OBJECTIVE: We have investigated the role of IPMK in regulating angiogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Deletion of IPMK in fibroblasts induces angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models. IPMK deletion elicits a substantial increase of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), which mediates the regulation of angiogenesis by IPMK. The regulation of VEGF by IPMK requires its catalytic activity. IPMK is predominantly nuclear and regulates gene transcription. However, IPMK does not apparently serve as a transcription factor for VEGF. HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-1alpha is a major determinant of angiogenesis and induces VEGF transcription. IPMK deletion elicits a major enrichment of HIF-1alpha protein and thus VEGF. HIF-1alpha is constitutively ubiquitinated by pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein) followed by proteasomal degradation under normal conditions. However, HIF-1alpha is not recognized and ubiquitinated by pVHL in IPMK KO (knockout) cells. IP5 reinstates the interaction of HIF-1alpha and pVHL. HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation, which is prerequisite for pVHL recognition, is interrupted in IPMK-deleted cells. IP5 promotes HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha. Deletion of IPMK in mouse brain increases HIF-1alpha/VEGF levels and vascularization. The increased VEGF in IPMK KO disrupts blood-brain barrier and enhances brain blood vessel permeability. CONCLUSIONS: IPMK, via its product IP5, negatively regulates angiogenesis by inhibiting VEGF expression. IP5 acts by enhancing HIF-1alpha hydroxylation and thus pVHL-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha.", "author_address": "Fu, Chenglai. From the Solomon H.

Here, we report a case of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma, clear cell variant, in a 63-year-old female patient with a novel VHL gene mutation and an unusual indolent clinical course. The patient, who has no clinical history of asbestos exposure, presented with a 27.2-cm upper abdominal mass and a 5.5-cm liver lesion. Retrospective review of the patient's abdominal computed tomographic scan 4 years ago showed 2 small abdominal lesions that were felt clinically to represent hemangiomas. These were retrospectively considered to have grown in size and represented the current abdominal mass. Both masses were subsequently biopsied and showed a proliferation of monomorphic epithelioid cells with distinct cell membranes, fine chromatin, and clear to finely vacuolated pale eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in nests and solid sheets. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed it to be malignant mesothelioma. Clear cell variant of peritoneal epithelioid mesothelioma should always be considered in patients with an abdominal or pelvic mass with clear cell features. Given the rarity of such entity, its clinical course and prognosis remains unclear.

For patients who develop bilateral disease, complete removal of both adrenal glands (total adrenalectomy) will result in lifelong adrenal insufficiency with an increased risk of death from adrenal crisis. Unilateral/bilateral adrenal-sparing surgery (subtotal adrenalectomy) offers preservation of cortical function and independence from steroids, but leaves the adrenal medulla in situ and thus at risk of developing new and possibly malignant disease. Here, present knowledge about how tumour genotype relates to clinical behaviour is reviewed, and application of this knowledge when choosing the extent of adrenalectomy is discussed. METHODS: A literature review was undertaken of the penetrance of the different genotypes in phaeochromocytomas, the frequency of bilateral disease and malignancy, and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, with emphasis on explaining the clinical phenotypes of phaeochromocytomas and their associated syndromes. RESULTS: Patients with bilateral phaeochromocytomas most often have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) with high-penetrance mutations for benign disease, whereas patients with mutations in the genes encoding SDHB (succinate dehydrogenase subunit B) or MAX (myelocytomatosis viral proto-oncogene homologue-associated factor X) are at increased risk of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Adrenal-sparing surgery should be the standard approach for patients who have already been diagnosed with MEN2 or VHL when operating on the first side, whereas complete removal of the affected adrenal gland(s) is generally recommended for patients with SDHB or MAX germline mutations. Routine assessment of a patient's genotype, even after the first operation, can be crucial for adopting an appropriate strategy for follow-up and future surgery.", "author_address": "Rossitti, H M.

Previous functional studies of HIF activation in the pancreas have used Vhlh (the murine homolog of VHL) deficient mice. However, the role of each specific HIF transcription factors in the pancreas has not been thoroughly examined. We derived mice that constitutively express a normoxia-stable form of HIF2alpha in the pancreas. Activation of HIF2alpha in the pancreas severely impairs postnatal exocrine pancreas. Mice with pancreas-specific activation of HIF2alpha develop histological features reminiscent of pancreatitis including loss of acinar cells, ductal dilation and fibrosis.

It may arise sporadically or in association with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL). The ELST prevalence in VHL ranges from 3 to 16% and may be the initial presentation of the disease. Onset is usually in the 3rd to 5th decade with hearing loss and an indolent course. ELSTs present as locally destructive lesions with characteristic computed tomography imaging features. Histologically, they show papillary, cystic or glandular architectures. Immunohistochemically, they express keratin, EMA, and variably S100 and GFAP. Currently it is recommended that, given its rarity, ELST needs to be differentiated from other entities with similar morphologic patterns, particularly other VHL-associated neoplasms such as metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Nineteen ELST cases were studied. Immunohistochemistry (18/19) and single nucleotide polymorphism microarray testing was performed (12/19). Comparison with the immunophenotype and copy number profile in RCC is discussed. Patients presented with characteristic bone destructive lesions in the petrous temporal bones. Pathology of tumors showed characteristic ELST morphology with immunoexpression of CK7, GFAP, S100, PAX-8, PAX-2, CA-9 in the tumor cells. Immunostaines for RCC, CD10, CK20, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, TTF-1, thyroglobulin, and transthyretin were negative in the tumor cells. Molecular testing showed loss of 3p and 9q in 66% (8/12) and 58% (7/12) cases, respectively. Immunoreactivity for renal markers in ELST is an important diagnostic caveat and has not been previously reported. In fact, renal markers are currently recommended in order to rule out metastatic RCC although PAX gene complex and CA-9 have been implicated in the development of the inner ear. Importantly copy number assessment of ELST has not been previously reported. Loss of 3p (including the VHL locus) in ELST suggests similar mechanistic origins as ccRCC.", "author_address": "Jester, Rachel.
